  descriptionText: "\n\nGREATER OMENTUM\n\n\nThe greater omentum (also the great
    omentum, omentum majus, gastrocolic omentum, epiploon, or, especially in animals,
    caul) is a large apron-like fold of visceral peritoneum that hangs down from
    the stomach. \n\nIt extends from the greater curvature of the stomach, passing
    in front of the small intestines and doubles back to ascend to the transverse
    colon before reaching to the posterior abdominal wall. \n\nThe greater omentum
    is larger than the lesser omentum, which hangs down from the liver to the lesser
    curvature. \n\nThe common anatomical term \"epiploic\" derives from \"epiploon\",
    from the Greek epipleein, meaning to float or sail on, since the greater omentum
    appears to float on the surface of the intestines. \n\nIt is the first structure
    observed when the abdominal cavity is opened anteriorly (from the front).\n\n\n==
    Structure ==\n\n\nThe greater omentum is the larger of the two peritoneal folds.
    \n\nIt consists of a double sheet of peritoneum, folded on itself so that it
    has four layers.The two layers of the greater omentum descend from the greater
    curvature of the stomach and the beginning of the duodenum. \n\nThey pass in
    front of the small intestines, sometimes as low as the pelvis, before turning
    on themselves, and ascending as far as the transverse colon, where they separate
    and enclose that part of the intestine.These individual layers are easily seen
    in the young, but in the adult they are more or less inseparably blended.\nThe
    left border of the greater omentum is continuous with the gastrosplenic ligament;
    its right border extends as far as the beginning of the duodenum.\nThe greater
    omentum is usually thin, and has a perforated appearance. \n\nIt contains some
    adipose tissue, which can accumulate considerably in obese people. \n\nIt is
    highly vascularised.\n\n\n=== Subdivisions ===\n\n\nThe greater omentum is often
    defined to encompass a variety of structures. \n\nMost sources include the following
    three:\nGastrophrenic ligament\u2014extends to the underside of the left dome
    of the diaphragm\nGastrocolic ligament\u2014extends to the transverse colon (occasionally
    on its own considered synonymous with \"greater omentum\")\nGastrosplenic ligament
    (or Gastrolienal) ligament)\u2014 extends to the spleen, overlying the kidneyThe
    splenorenal ligament (or lienorenal ligament) (from the left kidney to the spleen)
    is occasionally considered part of the greater omentum. \n\nIt is derived from
    the peritoneum, where the wall of the general peritoneal cavity comes into contact
    with the lesser sac between the left kidney and the spleen; the splenic artery
    and vein pass between its two layers. \n\nIt contains the tail of the pancreas,
    the only intraperitoneal portion of the pancreas, and splenic vessels. \n\nOne
    or more of the preceding sentences incorporates text in the public domain from
    the 20th edition of Gray's Anatomy (1918)\n\n\n==== Phrenicosplenic ligament
    ====\nThe phrenosplenic ligament (lienophrenic ligament or phrenicolienal ligament)
    is a double fold of peritoneum that connects the thoracic diaphragm and spleen.The
    phrenicosplenic ligament is part of the greater omentum. \n\nDistinctions between
    the phrenicosplenic ligament and adjacent ligaments, such as the gastrophrenic,
    gastrosplenic and splenorenal ligaments, which are all part of the same mesenteric
    sheet, are often nebulous.\n\n\n=== Blood supply ===\n\nThe right and left gastroepiploic
    arteries (also known as gastroomental) provide the sole blood supply to the greater
    omentum. \n\nBoth are branches of the celiac trunk. \n\nThe right gastroepiploic
    artery is a branch of the gastroduodenal artery, which is a branch of the common
    hepatic artery, which is a branch of the celiac trunk. \n\nThe left gastroepiploic
    artery is the largest branch of the splenic artery, which is a branch of the
    celiac trunk. \n\nThe right and left gastroepiploic arteries anastomose within
    the two layers of the anterior greater omentum along the greater curvature of
    the stomach.\n\n\n=== Development ===\n\n\nThe greater omentum develops from
    the dorsal mesentery that connects the stomach to the posterior abdominal wall.
    \n\nDuring its development, the stomach undergoes its first 90\xB0 rotation along
    the axis of the embryo, so that posterior structures are moved to the left and
    structures anterior to the stomach are shifted to the right. \n\nAs a result,
    the dorsal mesentery folds over on itself, forming a pouch with its blind end
    on the left side of the embryo. \n\nA second approximately 90\xB0 rotation of
    the stomach, this time in the frontal plane, moves structures inferior if they
    were originally to the left of the stomach, and superior if they were originally
    to the stomach's right. \n\nConsequently, the blind-ended sac (also called the
    lesser sac) formed by the dorsal mesentery is brought inferiorly, where it assumes
    its final position as the greater omentum. \n\nIt grows to the point that it
    covers the majority of the small and large intestine.\n\n\n== Functions ==\n\nThe
    functions of the greater omentum are:\n\nFat deposition, having varying amounts
    of adipose tissue\nImmune contribution, having milky spots of macrophage collections\nInfection
    and wound isolation; It may also physically limit the spread of intraperitoneal
    infections. \n\nThe greater omentum can often be found wrapped around areas of
    infection and trauma.\n\n\n== Clinical significance ==\n\n\n\n=== Surgical removal
    ===\n\nOmentectomy refers to the surgical removal of the omentum, a relatively
    simple procedure with no documented major side effects, that is performed in
    cases where there is concern that there may be spread of cancerous tissue into
    the omentum. \n\nExamples for this are ovarian cancer and advanced or aggressive
    endometrial cancer as well as intestinal cancer and also appendix cancer. \n\nThe
    procedure is generally done as an add-on when the primary lesion is removed.\n\n\n===
    Omental flap ===\n\nThe greater omentum may be surgically harvested for reconstruction
    of the thoracic wall. \n\nIt has also been used experimentally to reinforce bioengineered
    tissues transplanted to the surface of the heart for cardiac regeneration.\n\n\n===
    Use in brain surgery ===\n\nThe greater omentum may be surgically harvested to
    provide revascularization of brain tissue after a stroke.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe
    greater omentum is also known as the great omentum, the omentum majus, the gastrocolic
    omentum, the epiploon, and the caul.\nIn 1906, the greater omentum was described
    as the \"abdominal policeman\" by the surgeon James Rutherford Morrison. \n\nThis
    is due to its immunological function, whereby omental tissue seems to \"surveil\"
    the abdomen for infection and cover areas of infection when found - walling it
    off with immunologically active tissue.\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_omentum"

  descriptionText: "\n\nSTOMACH\n\n\nThe stomach is a muscular, hollow organ in the
    gastrointestinal tract of humans and many other animals, including several invertebrates.
    \n\nThe stomach has a dilated structure and functions as a vital digestive organ.
    \n\nIn the digestive system the stomach is involved in the second phase of digestion,
    following chewing. \n\nIt performs a chemical breakdown by means of enzymes and
    hydrochloric acid.\nIn humans and many other animals, the stomach is located
    between the oesophagus and the small intestine. \n\nThe stomach secretes digestive
    enzymes and gastric acid to aid in food digestion. \n\nThe pyloric sphincter
    controls the passage of partially digested food (chyme) from the stomach into
    the duodenum, where peristalsis takes over to move this through the rest of intestines.\n\n\n==
    Structure ==\n\nIn humans, the stomach lies between the oesophagus and the duodenum
    (the first part of the small intestine). \n\nIt is in the left upper part of
    the abdominal cavity. \n\nThe top of the stomach lies against the diaphragm.
    \n\nLying behind the stomach is the pancreas. \n\nA large double fold of visceral
    peritoneum called the greater omentum hangs down from the greater curvature of
    the stomach. \n\nTwo sphincters keep the contents of the stomach contained; the
    lower oesophageal sphincter (found in the cardiac region), at the junction of
    the oesophagus and stomach, and the pyloric sphincter at the junction of the
    stomach with the duodenum.\n\nThe stomach is surrounded by parasympathetic (stimulant)
    and sympathetic (inhibitor) plexuses (networks of blood vessels and nerves in
    the anterior gastric, posterior, superior and inferior, celiac and myenteric),
    which regulate both the secretory activity of the stomach and the motor (motion)
    activity of its muscles.\n\nBecause it is a distensible organ, it normally expands
    to hold about one litre of food. \n\nThe stomach of a newborn human baby will
    only be able to retain about 30 millilitres. \n\nThe maximum stomach volume in
    adults is between 2 and 4 litres.\n\n\n=== Sections ===\n\n\nIn classical anatomy
    the human stomach is divided into four sections, beginning at the cardia.\n\nThe
    cardia is where the contents of the esophagus empty into the stomach.\n\nThe
    fundus (from Latin 'bottom') is formed in the upper curved part.\nThe body is
    the main, central region of the stomach.\n\nThe pylorus (from Greek 'gatekeeper')
    is the lower section of the stomach that empties contents into the duodenum.\n\nThe
    cardia is defined as the region following the \"z-line\" of the gastroesophageal
    junction, the point at which the epithelium changes from stratified squamous
    to columnar. \n\nNear the cardia is the lower oesophageal sphincter. \n\nRecent
    research has shown that the cardia is not an anatomically distinct region of
    the stomach but a region of the oesophageal lining damaged by reflux.\n\n\n===
    Anatomical proximity ===\n\nThe stomach bed refers to the structures upon which
    the stomach rests in mammals. \n\nThese include the pancreas, spleen, left kidney,
    left suprarenal gland, transverse colon and its mesocolon, and the diaphragm.
    \n\nThe term was introduced around 1896 by Philip Polson of the Catholic University
    School of Medicine, Dublin. \n\nHowever this was brought into disrepute by surgeon
    anatomist J Massey.\n\n\n=== Blood supply ===\n\n\nThe lesser curvature of the
    human stomach is supplied by the right gastric artery inferiorly and the left
    gastric artery superiorly, which also supplies the cardiac region. \n\nThe greater
    curvature is supplied by the right gastroepiploic artery inferiorly and the left
    gastroepiploic artery superiorly. \n\nThe fundus of the stomach, and also the
    upper portion of the greater curvature, is supplied by the short gastric arteries,
    which arise from the splenic artery.\n\n\n=== Microanatomy ===\n\n\n==== Wall
    ====\n\nLike the other parts of the gastrointestinal tract, the human stomach
    walls consist of a mucosa, submucosa, muscularis externa, subserosa and serosa.\n\nThe
    inner part of the lining of the stomach, the gastric mucosa, consists of an outer
    layer of column-shaped cells, a lamina propria, and a thin layer of smooth muscle
    called the muscularis mucosa. \n\nBeneath the mucosa lies the submucosa, consisting
    of fibrous connective tissue. \n\nMeissner's plexus is in this layer interior
    to the oblique muscle layer.Outside of the submucosa lies another muscular layer,
    the muscularis externa. \n\nIt consists of three layers of muscular fibres, with
    fibres lying at angles to each other. \n\nThese are the inner oblique, middle
    circular, and outer longitudinal layers. \n\nThe presence of the inner oblique
    layer is distinct from other parts of the gastrointestinal tract, which do not
    possess this layer. \n\nStomach contains the thickest muscularis layer consisting
    of three layers, thus maximum peristalsis occurs here.\n\nThe inner oblique layer:
    This layer is responsible for creating the motion that churns and physically
    breaks down the food. \n\nIt is the only layer of the three which is not seen
    in other parts of the digestive system. \n\nThe antrum has thicker skin cells
    in its walls and performs more forceful contractions than the fundus.\n\nThe
    middle circular layer: At this layer, the pylorus is surrounded by a thick circular
    muscular wall, which is normally tonically constricted, forming a functional
    (if not anatomically discrete) pyloric sphincter, which controls the movement
    of chyme into the duodenum. \n\nThis layer is concentric to the longitudinal
    axis of the stomach.\n\nAuerbach's plexus (myenteric plexus) is found between
    the outer longitudinal and the middle circular layer and is responsible for the
    innervation of both (causing peristalsis and mixing).\n\nThe outer longitudinal
    layer is responsible for moving the bolus towards the pylorus of the stomach
    through muscular shortening.\n\nTo the outside of the muscularis externa lies
    a serosa, consisting of layers of connective tissue continuous with the peritoneum.\n\n\n====
    Glands ====\n\nThe mucosa lining the stomach is lined with a number of these
    pits, which receive gastric juice, secreted by between 2 and 7 gastric glands.
    \n\nGastric juice is an acidic fluid containing hydrochloric acid and the digestive
    enzyme pepsin. \n\nThe glands contains a number of cells, with the function of
    the glands changing depending on their position within the stomach.\n\nWithin
    the body and fundus of the stomach lie the fundic glands. \n\nIn general, these
    glands are lined by column-shaped cells that secrete a protective layer of mucus
    and bicarbonate. \n\nAdditional cells present include parietal cells that secrete
    hydrochloric acid and intrinsic factor, chief cells that secrete pepsinogen (this
    is a precursor to pepsin- the highly acidic environment converts the pepsinogen
    to pepsin), and neuroendocrine cells that secrete serotonin.Glands differ where
    the stomach meets the esophagus and near the pylorus. \n\nNear the junction between
    the stomach and the oesophagus lie cardiac glands, which primarily secrete mucus.
    \n\nThey are fewer in number than the other gastric glands and are more shallowly
    positioned in the mucosa. \n\nThere are two kinds - either simple tubular with
    short ducts or compound racemose resembling the duodenal Brunner's glands. \n\nNear
    the pylorus lie pyloric glands located in the antrum of the pylorus. \n\nThey
    secrete mucus, as well as gastrin produced by their G cells.\n\n\n=== Gene and
    protein expression ===\n\n\nAbout 20,000 protein coding genes are expressed in
    human cells and nearly 70% of these genes are expressed in the normal stomach.
    \n\nJust over 150 of these genes are more specifically expressed in the stomach
    compared to other organs, with only some 20 genes being highly specific. \n\nThe
    corresponding specific proteins expressed in stomach are mainly involved in creating
    a suitable environment for handling the digestion of food for uptake of nutrients.
    \n\nHighly stomach-specific proteins include GKN1, expressed in the mucosa; pepsinogen
    PGC and the lipase LIPF, expressed in chief cells; and gastric ATPase ATP4A and
    gastric intrinsic factor GIF, expressed in parietal cells.\n\n\n== Development
    ==\n\nIn early human embryogenesis, the ventral part of the embryo abuts the
    yolk sac. \n\nDuring the third week of development, as the embryo grows, it begins
    to surround parts of the sac. \n\nThe enveloped portions form the basis for the
    adult gastrointestinal tract. \n\nThe sac is surrounded by a network of vitelline
    arteries and veins. \n\nOver time, these arteries consolidate into the three
    main arteries that supply the developing gastrointestinal tract: the celiac artery,
    superior mesenteric artery, and inferior mesenteric artery. \n\nThe areas supplied
    by these arteries are used to define the foregut, midgut, and hindgut. \n\nThe
    surrounded sac becomes the primitive gut. \n\nSections of this gut begin to differentiate
    into the organs of the gastrointestinal tract, and the esophagus, and stomach
    form from the foregut.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\n=== Digestion ===\n\n\nIn the human
    digestive system, a bolus (a small rounded mass of chewed up food) enters the
    stomach through the esophagus via the lower esophageal sphincter. \n\nThe stomach
    releases proteases (protein-digesting enzymes such as pepsin) and hydrochloric
    acid, which kills or inhibits bacteria and provides the acidic pH of 2 for the
    proteases to work. \n\nFood is churned by the stomach through muscular contractions
    of the wall called peristalsis \u2013 reducing the volume of the bolus, before
    looping around the fundus and the body of stomach as the boluses are converted
    into chyme (partially digested food). \n\nChyme slowly passes through the pyloric
    sphincter and into the duodenum of the small intestine, where the extraction
    of nutrients begins.\n\nGastric juice in the stomach also contains pepsinogen.
    \n\nHydrochloric acid activates this inactive form of enzyme into the active
    form, pepsin. \n\nPepsin breaks down proteins into polypeptides.\n\n\n=== Absorption
    ===\n\nAlthough the absorption in the human digestive system is mainly a function
    of the small intestine, some absorption of certain small molecules nevertheless
    does occur in the stomach through its lining. \n\nThis includes:\n\nWater, if
    the body is dehydrated\nMedication, such as aspirin\nAmino acids\n10\u201320%
    of ingested ethanol (e.g. from alcoholic beverages)\nCaffeine\nTo a small extent
    water-soluble vitamins (most are absorbed in the small intestine)\nThe parietal
    cells of the human stomach are responsible for producing intrinsic factor, which
    is necessary for the absorption of vitamin B12. \n\nB12 is used in cellular metabolism
    and is necessary for the production of red blood cells, and the functioning of
    the nervous system.\n\n\n=== Control of secretion and motility ===\n\nThe movement
    and the flow of chemicals into the stomach are controlled by both the autonomic
    nervous system and by the various digestive hormones of the digestive system:\n\nOther
    than gastrin, these hormones all act to turn off the stomach action. \n\nThis
    is in response to food products in the liver and gall bladder, which have not
    yet been absorbed. \n\nThe stomach needs to push food into the small intestine
    only when the intestine is not busy. \n\nWhile the intestine is full and still
    digesting food, the stomach acts as storage for food.\n\n\n=== Other ===\n\nEffects
    of EGFEpidermal growth factor (EGF) results in cellular proliferation, differentiation,
    and survival. \n\nEGF is a low-molecular-weight polypeptide first purified from
    the mouse submandibular gland, but since then found in many human tissues including
    the submandibular gland, and the parotid gland. \n\nSalivary EGF, which also
    seems to be regulated by dietary inorganic iodine, also plays an important physiological
    role in the maintenance of oro-oesophageal and gastric tissue integrity. \n\nThe
    biological effects of salivary EGF include healing of oral and gastroesophageal
    ulcers, inhibition of gastric acid secretion, stimulation of DNA synthesis, and
    mucosal protection from intraluminal injurious factors such as gastric acid,
    bile acids, pepsin, and trypsin and from physical, chemical, and bacterial agents.\n\nStomach
    as nutrition sensorThe human stomach can \"taste\" sodium glutamate using glutamate
    receptors and this information is passed to the lateral hypothalamus and limbic
    system in the brain as a palatability signal through the vagus nerve. \n\nThe
    stomach can also sense, independently of tongue and oral taste receptors, glucose,
    carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. \n\nThis allows the brain to link nutritional
    value of foods to their tastes.\nThyrogastric syndromeThis syndrome defines the
    association between thyroid disease and chronic gastritis, which was first described
    in the 1960s. \n\nThis term was coined also to indicate the presence of thyroid
    autoantibodies or autoimmune thyroid disease in patients with pernicious anemia,
    a late clinical stage of atrophic gastritis. \n\nIn 1993, has been published
    a more complete investigation on the stomach and thyroid, reporting that the
    thyroid is, embryogenetically and phylogenetically, derived from primitive stomach,
    and that the thyroid cells, such as primitive gastroenteric cells, during vertebrate
    evolution, migrated and specialized in uptake of iodide and in storage and elaboration
    of iodine compounds. \n\nIn fact, stomach and thyroid share iodine-concentranting
    ability and many morphological and functional similarities, such as cell polarity
    and apical microvilli, similar organ-specific antigens and associated autoimmune
    diseases, secretion of glycoproteins (thyroglobulin and mucin) and peptide hormones,
    the digesting and readsorbing ability, and lastly, similar ability to form iodotyrosines
    by peroxidase activity, where iodide acts as an electron donor in the presence
    of H2O2. \n\nIn the following years, many researchers published reviews about
    this syndrome.\n\n\n== Clinical significance ==\n\n\n=== Diseases ===\n\n\nA
    series of radiographs can be used to examine the stomach for various disorders.
    \n\nThis will often include the use of a barium swallow. \n\nAnother method of
    examination of the stomach, is the use of an endoscope. \n\nA gastric emptying
    scan is considered the gold standard to assess gastric emptying rate.A large
    number of studies have indicated that most cases of peptic ulcers, and gastritis,
    in humans are caused by Helicobacter pylori infection, and an association has
    been seen with the development of stomach cancer.A stomach rumble is actually
    noise from the intestines.\n\n\n=== Surgery ===\n\nIn humans, many bariatric
    surgery procedures involve the stomach, in order to lose weight. \n\nA gastric
    band may be placed around the cardia area, which can adjust to limit intake.
    \n\nThe anatomy of the stomach may be modified, or the stomach may be bypassed
    entirely.\n\nSurgical removal of the stomach is called a gastrectomy, and removal
    of the cardia area is a called a cardiectomy. \"Cardiectomy\" is a term that
    is also used to describe the removal of the heart. \n\nA gastrectomy may be carried
    out because of gastric cancer or severe perforation of the stomach wall.\n\nFundoplication
    is stomach surgery in which the fundus is wrapped around the lower esophagus
    and stitched into place. \n\nIt is used to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease
    (GERD).\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThere were previously conflicting statements in
    the academic anatomy community over whether the cardia is part of the stomach,
    part of the oesophagus or a distinct entity. \n\nModern surgical and medical
    textbooks have agreed that \"the gastric cardia is now clearly considered to
    be part of the stomach.\"\n\n\n=== Etymology ===\n\nThe word stomach is derived
    from the Latin stomachus which has roots from the Greek word stomachos (\u03C3\u03C4\u03CC\u03BC\u03B1\u03C7\u03BF\u03C2),
    ultimately from stoma (\u03C3\u03C4\u03CC\u03BC\u03B1), \"mouth\". \n\nGastro-
    and gastric (meaning \"related to the stomach\") are both derived from the Greek
    word gaster (\u03B3\u03B1\u03C3\u03C4\u03AE\u03C1, meaning \"belly\").\n\n\n==
    Other animals ==\n\nAlthough the precise shape and size of the stomach varies
    widely among different vertebrates, the relative positions of the oesophageal
    and duodenal openings remain relatively constant. \n\nAs a result, the organ
    always curves somewhat to the left before curving back to meet the pyloric sphincter.
    \n\nHowever, lampreys, hagfishes, chimaeras, lungfishes, and some teleost fish
    have no stomach at all, with the oesophagus opening directly into the intestine.
    \n\nThese animals all consume diets that require little storage of food, no predigestion
    with gastric juices, or both.The gastric lining is usually divided into two regions,
    an anterior portion lined by fundic glands and a posterior portion lined with
    pyloric glands. \n\nCardiac glands are unique to mammals, and even then are absent
    in a number of species. \n\nThe distributions of these glands vary between species,
    and do not always correspond with the same regions as in humans. \n\nFurthermore,
    in many non-human mammals, a portion of the stomach anterior to the cardiac glands
    is lined with epithelium essentially identical to that of the oesophagus. \n\nRuminants,
    in particular, have a complex stomach, the first three chambers of which are
    all lined with oesophageal mucosa.\n\nIn birds and crocodilians, the stomach
    is divided into two regions. \n\nAnteriorly is a narrow tubular region, the proventriculus,
    lined by fundic glands, and connecting the true stomach to the crop. \n\nBeyond
    lies the powerful muscular gizzard, lined by pyloric glands, and, in some species,
    containing stones that the animal swallows to help grind up food.In insects there
    is also a crop. \n\nThe insect stomach is called the midgut.\nInformation about
    the stomach in echinoderms or molluscs can be found under the respective articles.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"

  descriptionText: "\n\nPAROTID DUCT\n\n\nThe parotid duct, or Stensen duct,is a
    salivary duct. \n\nIt is the route that saliva takes from the major salivary
    gland, the parotid gland, into the mouth.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe parotid
    duct is formed when several interlobular ducts, the largest ducts inside the
    parotid gland, join. \n\nIt emerges from the parotid gland. \n\nIt runs forward
    along the lateral side of the masseter muscle for around 7 cm. \n\nIn this course,
    the duct is surrounded by the buccal fat pad. \n\nIt takes a steep turn at the
    border of the masseter and passes through the buccinator muscle, opening into
    the vestibule of the mouth, the region of the mouth between the cheek and the
    gums, at the parotid papilla, which lies across the second Maxillary (upper)
    molar tooth.\n\nThe buccinator acts as a valve that prevents air forcing into
    the duct, which would cause pneumoparotitis. \n\nRunning along with the duct
    superiorly is the transverse facial artery and upper buccal nerve; running along
    with the duct inferiorly is the lower buccal nerve.\n\nThe exit of the parotid
    ducts can be felt as small bumps (papillae) on both sides of the mouth, and are
    usually positioned next to the maxillary second molars.\n\n\n=== Relations ===\n\nThe
    parotid duct lies close to the buccal branch of the facial nerve (VII). \n\nIt
    is also close to the transverse facial artery.\n\n\n== Clinical significance
    ==\n\nBlockage, whether caused by salivary duct stones or external compression,
    may cause pain and swelling of the parotid gland (parotitis).\n\nKoplik's spots
    which are pathognomonic of measles are found near the opening of the parotid
    duct.\n\nThe parotid duct may be cannulated by inserting a tube through the internal
    orifice in the mouth. \n\nDye may be injected to allow for imaging of the parotid
    duct.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe parotid duct is named after Nicolas Steno (1638\u20131686),
    also known as Niels Stensen, a Danish anatomist (albeit best known as a geologist)
    credited with its detailed description in 1660. \n\nThis is where the alternative
    name \"Stensen duct\" originates from.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parotid_duct"

  descriptionText: "\n\nUVULA OF PALATE\n\n\nThe palatine uvula, usually referred
    to as simply the uvula, is a conic projection from the back edge of the middle
    of the soft palate, composed of connective tissue containing a number of racemose
    glands, and some muscular fibers.\n\nIt also contains many serous glands, which
    produce thin saliva.\n\nStructure\nMuscle\n\nThe muscular part of the uvula (Latin:
    musculus uvulae) shortens and broadens the uvula. \n\nThis changes the contour
    of the posterior part of the soft palate. \n\nThis change in contour allows the
    soft palate to adapt closely to the posterior pharyngeal wall to help close the
    nasopharynx during swallowing.\n\nIts muscles are controlled by the pharyngeal
    branch of the vagus nerve.\n\n\n==Function==\n\nDuring swallowing, the soft palate
    and the uvula move together to close off the nasopharynx, and prevent food from
    entering the nasal cavity.\n\nIt has also been proposed that the abundant amount
    of thin saliva produced by the uvula serves to keep the throat well lubricated.\n\nIt
    has a function in speech as well. \n\nIn many languages, the uvula is used to
    articulate a range of consonant sounds, known as uvular consonants. \n\nThe voiced
    uvular trill, written [\u0280] in the International Phonetic Alphabet, is one
    example; it is used in French, Arabic and Hebrew, among other languages. \n\nDue
    to the large amount of saliva produced from glands in the uvula that are absent
    in other mammals, it has been suggested that the uvula is an accessory speech
    organ.\n\nStimulation of the uvula also causes the gag reflex to initiate. \n\nThis
    is often a problem for people with uvula piercings, and a common method of inducing
    vomiting.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palatine_uvula"

  descriptionText: "\n\nEJACULATORY DUCT\n\n\nThe ejaculatory ducts (ductus ejaculatorii)
    are paired structures in male anatomy. \n\nEach ejaculatory duct is formed by
    the union of the vas deferens with the duct of the seminal vesicle. \n\nThey
    pass through the prostate, and open into the urethra above the seminal colliculus.
    \n\nDuring ejaculation, semen passes through the prostate gland, enters the urethra
    and exits the body via the urinary meatus.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\n\n\n=== Ejaculation
    ===\n\n\nEjaculation occurs in two stages, the emission stage and the expulsion
    stage. \n\nThe emission stage involves the workings of several structures of
    the ejaculatory duct; contractions of the prostate gland, the seminal vesicles,
    the bulbourethral gland and the vas deferens push fluids into the prostatic urethra.
    \n\nThe semen is stored here until ejaculation occurs. \n\nMuscles at the base
    of the penis contract in order to propel the seminal fluid trapped in the prostatic
    urethra through the penile urethra and expel it through the urinary meatus. \n\nThe
    ejaculate is expelled in spurts, due to the movement of the muscles propelling
    it. \n\nThese muscle contractions are related to the sensations of orgasm for
    the male.Sperm is produced in the testes and enters the ejaculatory ducts via
    the vas deferens. \n\nAs it passes by the seminal vesicles, a fluid rich in fructose
    combines with sperm. \n\nThis addition nourishes the sperm in order to keep it
    active and motile. \n\nSeminal fluid continues down the ejaculatory duct into
    the prostate gland, where an alkaline prostatic fluid is added. \n\nThis addition
    provides the texture and odor associated with semen. \n\nThe alkalinity of the
    prostatic fluid serves to neutralize the acidity of the female vaginal tract
    in order to prolong the survival of sperm in this harsh environment. \n\nSemen
    is now a fructose-rich, alkaline fluid containing sperm as it enters the bulbourethral
    glands below the prostate. \n\nThe bulbourethral glands secrete a small amount
    of clear fluid into the urethra before the ejaculate is expelled. \n\nThe functions
    of this fluid are not entirely known but are suggested to aid in lubricating
    the male urethra in preparation for the semen during ejaculation. \n\nThe amount
    of semen produced and expelled during ejaculation corresponds to the length of
    time that the male is sexually aroused before ejaculation occurs. \n\nGenerally,
    the longer the period of arousal, the larger the amount of seminal fluid.Ejaculation
    and orgasm may occur simultaneously, however they are not coupled, in that one
    may occur without the other. \n\nFor example, a man may have a dry orgasm (termed
    Retrograde ejaculation); there is no expulsion of ejaculate however the man still
    experiences orgasm. \n\nAlso, paraplegics may ejaculate seminal fluid but not
    experience the sensation of orgasm.\n\n\n== Clinical relevance ==\n\n\n\n===
    Ejaculatory duct obstruction ===\n\n\nEjaculatory duct obstruction is an acquired
    or congenital pathological condition in which one or both ejaculatory ducts are
    obstructed. \n\nIn the case that both ejaculatory ducts are obstructed, this
    illness presents with the symptoms of aspermia and male infertility.,\n\n\n===
    Benign prostatic hyperplasia ===\n\n\nSurgery to correct benign prostatic hyperplasia
    may destroy these ducts resulting in retrograde ejaculation. \n\nRetrograde ejaculation
    empties the seminal fluid formed in the emission phase into the bladder of the
    male instead of expelling it through the urethra and out the tip of the penis.
    \n\nThis results in a dry orgasm, where orgasm may still be experienced but without
    expulsion of semen from the ejaculatory ducts.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejaculatory_duct"

  descriptionText: "\n\nJEJUNUM\n\n\nThe jejunum is the second part of the small
    intestine in humans and most higher vertebrates, including mammals, reptiles,
    and birds. \n\nIts lining is specialised for the absorption by enterocytes of
    small nutrient molecules which have been previously digested by enzymes in the
    duodenum.\nThe jejunum lies between the duodenum and the ileum and is considered
    to start at the suspensory muscle of the duodenum, a location called the duodenojejunal
    flexure. \n\nThe division between the jejunum and ileum is not anatomically distinct.
    \n\nIn adult humans, the small intestine is usually 6\u20137 m (20\u201323 ft)
    long (post mortem), about two-fifths of which (about 2.5 m (8.2 ft)) is the jejunum.\n\n\n==
    Structure ==\n\n\nThe interior surface of the jejunum\u2014which is exposed to
    ingested food\u2014is covered in finger\u2013like projections of mucosa, called
    villi, which increase the surface area of tissue available to absorb nutrients
    from ingested foodstuffs. \n\nThe epithelial cells which line these villi have
    microvilli. \n\nThe transport of nutrients across epithelial cells through the
    jejunum and ileum includes the passive transport of sugar fructose and the active
    transport of amino acids, small peptides, vitamins, and most glucose. \n\nThe
    villi in the jejunum are much longer than in the duodenum or ileum.\nThe pH in
    the jejunum is usually between 7 and 8 (neutral or slightly alkaline).\nThe jejunum
    and the ileum are suspended by mesentery which gives the bowel great mobility
    within the abdomen. \n\nIt also contains circular and longitudinal smooth muscle
    which helps to move food along by a process known as peristalsis.\n\n\n=== Histology
    ===\n\nThe jejunum contains very few Brunner's glands (found in the duodenum)
    or Peyer's patches (found in the ileum). \n\nHowever, there are a few jejunal
    lymph nodes suspended in its mesentery. \n\nThe jejunum has many large circular
    folds in its submucosa called plicae circulares that which increase the surface
    area for nutrient absorption. \n\nThe plicae circulares are best developed in
    the jejunum.\nThere is no line of demarcation between the jejunum and the ileum.
    \n\nHowever, there are subtle histological differences:\n\nThe jejunum has less
    fat inside its mesentery than the ileum.\nThe jejunum is typically of larger
    diameter than the ileum.\nThe villi of the jejunum look like long, finger-like
    projections, and are a histologically identifiable structure.\nWhile the length
    of the entire intestinal tract contains lymphoid tissue, only the ileum has abundant
    Peyer's patches, which are unencapsulated lymphoid nodules that contain large
    numbers of lymphocytes and immune cells, like microfold cells.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n==
    Function ==\n\nThe lining of the jejunum is specialized for the absorption by
    enterocytes of small nutrient particles which have been previously digested by
    enzymes in the duodenum. \n\nOnce absorbed, nutrients (with the exception of
    fat, which goes to the lymph) pass from the enterocytes into the enterohepatic
    circulation and enter the liver via the hepatic portal vein, where the blood
    is processed.\n\n\n== Other animals ==\n\nIn fish, the divisions of the small
    intestine are not as clear and the terms middle intestine or mid-gut may be used
    instead of jejunum.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n\n=== Etymology ===\n\nJejunum is
    derived from the Latin word j\u0113j\u016Bnus, meaning \"fasting.\" It was so
    called because this part of the small intestine was frequently found to be void
    of food following death, due to its intensive peristaltic activity relative to
    the duodenum and ileum.\nThe Early Modern English adjective jejune is derived
    from the same root.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jejunum"

    \n\nSimilar in structure to a large lymph node, it acts primarily as a blood
    filter. \n\nThe word spleen comes from Ancient Greek \u03C3\u03C0\u03BB\u03AE\u03BD
    (spl\u1E17n).The spleen plays important roles in regard to red blood cells (erythrocytes)
    and the immune system. \n\nIt removes old red blood cells and holds a reserve
    of blood, which can be valuable in case of hemorrhagic shock, and also recycles
    iron. \n\nAs a part of the mononuclear phagocyte system, it metabolizes hemoglobin
    removed from senescent red blood cells (erythrocytes). \n\nThe globin portion
    of hemoglobin is degraded to its constitutive amino acids, and the heme portion
    is metabolized to bilirubin, which is removed in the liver.\n\nThe spleen houses
    antibody-producing lymphocytes in its white pulp and monocytes which remove antibody-coated
    bacteria and antibody-coated blood cells by way of blood and lymph node circulation.
    \n\nThese monocytes, upon moving to injured tissue (such as the heart after myocardial
    infarction), turn into dendritic cells and macrophages while promoting tissue
    healing. \n\nThe spleen is a center of activity of the mononuclear phagocyte
    system and is analogous to a large lymph node, as its absence causes a predisposition
    to certain infections.In humans the spleen is purple in color and is in the left
    upper quadrant of the abdomen.\n\n\n== Anatomy ==\n\nThe spleen is underneath
    the left part of the diaphragm, and has a smooth, convex surface that faces the
    diaphragm. \n\nIt is underneath the ninth, tenth, and eleventh ribs. \n\nThe
    other side of the spleen is divided by a ridge into two regions: an anterior
    gastric portion, and a posterior renal portion. \n\nThe gastric surface is directed
    forward, upward, and toward the middle, is broad and concave, and is in contact
    with the posterior wall of the stomach. \n\nBelow this it is in contact with
    the tail of the pancreas. \n\nThe renal surface is directed medialward and downward.
    \n\nIt is somewhat flattened, considerably narrower than the gastric surface,
    and is in relation with the upper part of the anterior surface of the left kidney
    and occasionally with the left adrenal gland.\n\nThere are four ligaments attached
    to the spleen: gastrosplenic ligament, splenorenal ligament, colicosplenic ligament,
    and phrenocolic ligament.\n\n\n=== Measurements ===\n\nThe spleen, in healthy
    adult humans, is approximately 7 centimetres (2.8 in) to 14 centimetres (5.5
    in) in length.\n\nAn easy way to remember the anatomy of the spleen is the 1\xD73\xD75\xD77\xD79\xD710\xD711
    rule. \n\nThe spleen is 1 by 3 by 5 inches (3 by 8 by 13 cm), weighs approximately
    7 oz (200 g), and lies between the 9th and 11th ribs on the left-hand side and
    along the axis of 10th rib. \n\nThe weight varies between 1 oz (28 g) and 8 oz
    (230 g) (standard reference range), correlating mainly to height, body weight
    and degree of acute congestion but not to sex or age.\t\t\n\n\n=== Blood supply
    ===\n\n\nNear the middle of the spleen is a long fissure, the hilum, which is
    the point of attachment for the gastrosplenic ligament and the point of insertion
    for the splenic artery and splenic vein. \n\nThere are other openings present
    for lymphatic vessels and nerves.\nLike the thymus, the spleen possesses only
    efferent lymphatic vessels. \n\nThe spleen is part of the lymphatic system. \n\nBoth
    the short gastric arteries and the splenic artery supply it with blood.The germinal
    centers are supplied by arterioles called penicilliary radicles.\n\n\n=== Nerve
    supply ===\n\nThe spleen is innervated by the splenic plexus, which connects
    a branch of the celiac ganglia to the vagus nerve.\n\nThe underlying central
    nervous processes coordinating the spleen's function seem to be embedded into
    the Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal-axis, and the brainstem, especially the subfornical
    organ.\n\n\n=== Development ===\n\nThe spleen is unique in respect to its development
    within the gut. \n\nWhile most of the gut organs are endodermally derived, the
    spleen is derived from mesenchymal tissue. \n\nSpecifically, the spleen forms
    within, and from, the dorsal mesentery. \n\nHowever, it still shares the same
    blood supply\u2014the celiac trunk\u2014as the foregut organs.\n\n\n== Function
    ==\n\n\n\n=== Pulp ===\n\n=== Other ===\n\nOther functions of the spleen are
    less prominent, especially in the healthy adult:\n\nSpleen produces all types
    of blood cells during fetal life\nProduction of opsonins, properdin, and tuftsin.\nCreation
    of red blood cells. \n\nWhile the bone marrow is the primary site of hematopoiesis
    in the adult, the spleen has important hematopoietic functions up until the 5th
    month of gestation. \n\nAfter birth, erythropoietic functions cease, except in
    some hematologic disorders. \n\nAs a major lymphoid organ and a central player
    in the reticuloendothelial system, the spleen retains the ability to produce
    lymphocytes and, as such, remains a hematopoietic organ.\n\nStorage of red blood
    cells, lymphocytes and other formed elements. \n\nThe spleen of horses stores
    roughly 30 percent of the red blood cells and can release them when needed. \n\nIn
    humans, up to a cup (240 ml) of red blood cells is held within the spleen and
    released in cases of hypovolemia and hypoxia. \n\nIt can store platelets in case
    of an emergency and also clears old platelets from the circulation. \n\nUp to
    a quarter of lymphocytes are stored in the spleen at any one time.\n\n\n== Clinical
    significance ==\n\n\n=== Enlarged spleen ===\n\n\nEnlargement of the spleen is
    known as splenomegaly. \n\nIt may be caused by sickle cell anemia, sarcoidosis,
    malaria, bacterial endocarditis, leukemia, pernicious anemia, Gaucher's disease,
    leishmaniasis, Hodgkin's disease, Banti's disease, hereditary spherocytosis,
    cysts, glandular fever (mononucleosis or 'Mono' caused by the Epstein\u2013Barr
    virus), and tumours. \n\nPrimary tumors of the spleen include hemangiomas and
    hemangiosarcomas. \n\nMarked splenomegaly may result in the spleen occupying
    a large portion of the left side of the abdomen.\n\nThe spleen is the largest
    collection of lymphoid tissue in the body. \n\nIt is normally palpable in preterm
    infants, in 30% of normal, full-term neonates, and in 5% to 10% of infants and
    toddlers. \n\nA spleen easily palpable below the costal margin in any child over
    the age of 3\u20134 years should be considered abnormal until proven otherwise.\n\nSplenomegaly
    can result from antigenic stimulation (e.g., infection), obstruction of blood
    flow (e.g., portal vein obstruction), underlying functional abnormality (e.g.,
    hemolytic anemia), or infiltration (e.g., leukemia or storage disease, such as
    Gaucher's disease). \n\nThe most common cause of acute splenomegaly in children
    is viral infection, which is transient and usually moderate. \n\nBasic work-up
    for acute splenomegaly includes a complete blood count with differential, platelet
    count, and reticulocyte and atypical lymphocyte counts to exclude hemolytic anemia
    and leukemia. \n\nAssessment of IgM antibodies to viral capsid antigen (a rising
    titer) is indicated to confirm Epstein\u2013Barr virus or cytomegalovirus. \n\nOther
    infections should be excluded if these tests are negative.\n\n\n=== Splenic injury
    ===\n\n\nTrauma, such as a road traffic collision, can cause rupture of the spleen,
    which is a situation requiring immediate medical attention.\n\n\n=== Asplenia
    ===\n\n\nAsplenia refers to a non-functioning spleen, which may be congenital,
    or caused by traumatic injury, surgical resection (splenectomy) or a disease
    such as sickle cell anaemia. \n\nHyposplenia refers to a partially functioning
    spleen. \n\nThese conditions may cause a modest increase in circulating white
    blood cells and platelets, a diminished response to some vaccines, and an increased
    susceptibility to infection. \n\nIn particular, there is an increased risk of
    sepsis from polysaccharide encapsulated bacteria. \n\nEncapsulated bacteria inhibit
    binding of complement or prevent complement assembled on the capsule from interacting
    with macrophage receptors. \n\nPhagocytosis needs natural antibodies, which are
    immunoglobulins that facilitate phagocytosis either directly or by complement
    deposition on the capsule. \n\nThey are produced by IgM memory B cells (a subtype
    of B cells) in the marginal zone of the spleen.A splenectomy (removal of the
    spleen) results in a greatly diminished frequency of memory B cells. \n\nA 28-year
    follow-up of 740 World War II veterans whose spleens were removed on the battlefield
    showed a significant increase in the usual death rate from pneumonia (6 rather
    than the expected 1.3) and an increase in the death rate from ischemic heart
    disease (41 rather than the expected 30), but not from other conditions.\n\n\n===
    Accessory spleen ===\n\nAn accessory spleen is a small splenic nodule extra to
    the spleen usually formed in early embryogenesis. \n\nAccessory spleens are found
    in approximately 10 percent of the population and are typically around 1 centimeter
    in diameter. \n\nSplenosis is a condition where displaced pieces of splenic tissue
    (often following trauma or splenectomy) autotransplant in the abdominal cavity
    as accessory spleens.Polysplenia is a congenital disease manifested by multiple
    small accessory spleens, rather than a single, full-sized, normal spleen. \n\nPolysplenia
    sometimes occurs alone, but it is often accompanied by other developmental abnormalities
    such as intestinal malrotation or biliary atresia, or cardiac abnormalities,
    such as dextrocardia. \n\nThese accessory spleens are non-functional.\n\n\n===
    Infarction ===\n\n\nSplenic infarction is a condition in which blood flow supply
    to the spleen is compromised, leading to partial or complete infarction (tissue
    death due to oxygen shortage) in the organ.\n\nSplenic infarction occurs when
    the splenic artery or one of its branches are occluded, for example by a blood
    clot. \n\nAlthough it can occur asymptomatically, the typical symptom is severe
    pain in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen, sometimes radiating to the left
    shoulder. \n\nFever and chills develop in some cases. \n\nIt has to be differentiated
    from other causes of acute abdomen.\n\n\n=== Hyaloserositis ===\n\nThe spleen
    may be affected by hyaloserositis, in which it is coated with fibrous hyaline.\n\n\n==
    Society and culture ==\n\nThere has been a long and varied history of misconceptions
    regarding the physiological role of the spleen, and it has often been seen as
    a reservoir for juices closely linked to digestion. \n\nIn various cultures,
    the organ has been linked to melancholia, due to the influence of ancient Greek
    medicine and the associated doctrine of humourism, in which the spleen was believed
    to be a reservoir for an elusive fluid known as \"black bile\" (one of the four
    humours). \n\nThe spleen also plays an important role in traditional Chinese
    medicine, where it is considered to be a key organ that displays the Yin aspect
    of the Earth element (its Yang counterpart is the stomach). \n\nIn contrast,
    the Talmud (tractate Berachoth 61b) refers to the spleen as the organ of laughter
    while possibly suggesting a link with the humoral view of the organ.\n\nEtymologically,
    spleen comes from the Ancient Greek \u03C3\u03C0\u03BB\u03AE\u03BD (spl\u1E17n),
    where it was the idiomatic equivalent of the heart in modern English. \n\nPersius,
    in his satires, associated spleen with immoderate laughter.In English, William
    Shakespeare frequently used the word spleen to signify melancholy, but also caprice
    and merriment. \n\nIn Julius Caesar, he uses the spleen to describe Cassius's
    irritable nature:\n\nThe spleen, as a byword for melancholy, has also been considered
    an actual disease. \n\nIn the early 18th century, the physician Richard Blackmore
    considered it to be one of the two most prevalent diseases in England (along
    with consumption). \n\nIn 1701, Anne Finch (later, Countess of Winchilsea) had
    published a Pindaric ode, The Spleen, drawing on her first-hand experiences of
    an affliction which, at the time, also had a reputation of being a fashionably
    upper-class disease of the English. \n\nBoth Blackmore and George Cheyne treated
    this malady as the male equivalent of \"the vapours\", while preferring the more
    learned terms \"hypochondriasis\" and \"hysteria\". \n\nIn the late 18th century,
    the German word Spleen came to denote eccentric and hypochondriac tendencies
    that were thought to be characteristic of English people.In French, \"spl\xE9n\xE9tique\"
    refers to a state of pensive sadness or melancholy. \n\nThis usage was popularised
    by the poems of Charles Baudelaire (1821\u20131867) and his collection Le Spleen
    de Paris, but it was also present in earlier 19th-century Romantic literature.\n\n\n==
    In animals ==\n\n\nIn cartilaginous and ray-finned fish, the spleen consists
    primarily of red pulp and is normally somewhat elongated, as it lies inside the
    serosal lining of the intestine. \n\nIn many amphibians, especially frogs, it
    has the more rounded form and there is often a greater quantity of white pulp.
    \n\nA study published in 2009 using mice found that the red pulp of the spleen
    forms a reservoir that contains over half of the body's monocytes.In reptiles,
    birds, and mammals, white pulp is always relatively plentiful, and in birds and
    mammals the spleen is typically rounded, but it adjusts its shape somewhat to
    the arrangement of the surrounding organs. \n\nIn most vertebrates, the spleen
    continues to produce red blood cells throughout life; only in mammals this function
    is lost in middle-aged adults. \n\nMany mammals have tiny spleen-like structures
    known as haemal nodes throughout the body that are presumed to have the same
    function as the spleen. \n\nThe spleens of aquatic mammals differ in some ways
    from those of fully land-dwelling mammals; in general they are bluish in colour.
    \n\nIn cetaceans and manatees they tend to be quite small, but in deep diving
    pinnipeds, they can be massive, due to their function of storing red blood cells.\n\nThe
    only vertebrates lacking a spleen are the lampreys and hagfishes (the Cyclostomata).
    \n\nEven in these animals, there is a diffuse layer of haematopoeitic tissue
    within the gut wall, which has a similar structure to red pulp and is presumed
    homologous with the spleen of higher vertebrates.\n\nIn mice the spleen stores
    half the body's monocytes so that upon injury, they can migrate to the injured
    tissue and transform into dendritic cells and macrophages to assist wound healing.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spleen"

  descriptionText: "\n\nDUCTUS DEFERENS/VAS DEFERENS\n\n\nThe vas deferens, or ductus
    deferens, is part of the male reproductive system of many vertebrates. \n\nThe
    ducts transport sperm from the epididymis to the ejaculatory ducts in anticipation
    of ejaculation. \n\nThe vas deferens is a partially coiled tube which exits the
    abdominal cavity through the inguinal canal.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nVas deferens
    is Latin, meaning \"carrying-away vessel\"; the plural version is vasa deferentia.
    \n\nDuctus deferens is also Latin, meaning \"carrying-away duct\"; the plural
    version is ductus deferentes.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThere are two vasa deferentia,
    connecting the left and right epididymis with the seminal vesicles to form the
    ejaculatory duct in order to move sperm. \n\nIn humans, each tube is about 30
    centimeters (1 ft) long, 3 to 5 mm (0.118 to 0.197 inches) in diameter and is
    muscular (surrounded by smooth muscle). \n\nIts epithelium is pseudostratified
    columnar epithelium lined by stereocilia.\nThey are part of the spermatic cords.\n\n\n===
    Blood supply ===\n\nThe vas deferens is supplied by an accompanying artery (artery
    of vas deferens). \n\nThis artery normally arises from the superior (sometimes
    inferior) vesical artery, a branch of the internal iliac artery.\n\n\n=== Nerve
    supply ===\n\nThe vas deferens is innervated by a variety of different types
    of nerve ending. \n\nAdrenergic synapses are found in the smooth muscle layers.
    \n\nCholinergic synapses and vasoactive intestinal peptide synapses are found
    in the connective tissue of the mucosa. \n\nNoradrenergic synapses may also be
    present in the vas deferens.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\nDuring ejaculation, the smooth
    muscle in the walls of the vas deferens contracts reflexively, thus propelling
    the sperm forward. \n\nThis is also known as peristalsis. \n\nThe sperm is transferred
    from each vas deferens into the urethra, partially mixing with secretions from
    the male accessory sex glands such as the seminal vesicles, prostate gland and
    the bulbourethral glands, which form the bulk of semen.\n\n\n== Clinical significance
    ==\n\n\n\n=== Contraception ===\n\nA vasectomy is a method of contraception in
    which the vasa deferentia are permanently cut, though in some cases it can be
    reversed. \n\nA modern variation, which is also known as a vasectomy even though
    it does not include cutting the vas, involves injecting an obstructive material
    into the ductus to block the flow of sperm.\n\nInvestigational attempts for male
    contraception have focused on the vas with the use of the intra vas device and
    reversible inhibition of sperm under guidance.\n\n\n=== Disease ===\n\nThe vas
    deferens may be obstructed, or it may be completely absent in a condition known
    as congenital absence of the vas deferens (CAVD, a potential feature of cystic
    fibrosis), causing male infertility. \n\nAcquired obstructions can occur due
    to infections. \n\nTo treat these causes of male infertility, sperm can be harvested
    by testicular sperm extraction (TESE), microsurgical epididymal sperm aspiration
    (MESA), or other methods of collecting sperm cells directly from the testicle
    or epididymis.\n\n\n=== Uses in pharmacology and physiology ===\n\nThe vas deferens
    has a dense sympathetic innervation, making it a useful system for studying sympathetic
    nerve function and for studying drugs that modify neurotransmission.It has been
    used:\n\n-as a bioassay for the discovery of enkephalins, the endogenous opiates.\n\n-to
    demonstrate quantal transmission from sympathetic nerve terminals.\n\n-as the
    first direct measure of free Ca2+ concentration in a postganglionic nerve terminal.\n\n-to
    develop an optical method for monitoring packeted transmission (similar to quantal
    transmission).\n\n\n== Other animals ==\n\nMost vertebrates have some form of
    duct to transfer the sperm from the testes to the urethra. \n\nIn cartilaginous
    fish and amphibians, sperm is carried through the archinephric duct, which also
    partially helps to transport urine from the kidneys. \n\nIn teleosts, there is
    a distinct sperm duct, separate from the ureters, and often called the vas deferens,
    although probably not truly homologous with that in humans. \n\nThe vas deferens
    loops over the ureter in placental mammals, but not in marsupial mammals.\n\nIn
    cartilaginous fishes, the part of the archinephric duct closest to the testis
    is coiled up to form an epididymis. \n\nBelow this are a number of small glands
    secreting components of the seminal fluid. \n\nThe final portion of the duct
    also receives ducts from the kidneys in most species.In amniotes, however, the
    archinephric duct has become a true vas deferens, and is used only for conducting
    sperm, never urine. \n\nAs in cartilaginous fish, the upper part of the duct
    forms the epididymis. \n\nIn many species, the vas deferens ends in a small sac
    for storing sperm.The only vertebrates to lack any structure resembling a vas
    deferens are the primitive jawless fishes, which release sperm directly into
    the body cavity, and then into the surrounding water through a simple opening
    in the body wall.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vas_deferens"

  descriptionText: "\n\nGLANS PENIS\n\n\nThe glans penis, commonly referred to as
    the glans, is a structure at the distal end of the penis in male mammals. \n\nIt
    is the sensitive bulbous structure at the end of the human penis, and is anatomically
    homologous to the clitoral glans of the human female. \n\nThe glans penis may
    be smooth, spiny, elongated, or divided in other mammals.\n\nTypically, the glans
    is completely or partially covered by the foreskin in humans, except in those
    who have been circumcised. \n\nThe foreskin can generally be retracted over and
    past the glans, and may automatically retract during an erection. \n\nThe glans
    is more commonly known as the \"head\" or the \"tip\" of the penis. \n\nThe medical
    name comes from the Latin words glans (\"acorn\") and penis (\"of the penis\").\n\n\n==
    In humans ==\n\n\n=== Structure ===\n\nThe glans penis is the expanded cap of
    the corpus spongiosum. \n\nIt is moulded on the rounded ends of the corpora cavernosa
    penis, extending farther on their upper than on their lower surfaces. \n\nAt
    the summit of the glans is the slit-like vertical external urethral orifice.
    \n\nThe circumference of the base of the glans forms a rounded projecting border,
    the corona glandis, overhanging a deep retroglandular groove known as the coronal
    sulcus, behind which is the neck of the penis. \n\nThe proportional size of the
    glans penis can vary greatly. \n\nOn some penises it is much wider in circumference
    than the shaft, giving the penis a mushroom-like appearance, and on others it
    is narrower and more akin to a probe in shape. \n\nThe soft cushiony texture
    of the glans absorbs impact during rigorous instances of copulation.The foreskin
    maintains the mucosa in a moist environment. \n\nCircumcised penises have a glans
    which is permanently exposed and dry. \n\nSeveral studies have suggested the
    glans is equally sensitive in both circumcised and uncircumcised penises, while
    others have reported it is more sensitive in people who are not circumcised.\n\nHalata
    & Munger (1986) report that the density of genital corpuscles is greatest in
    the corona glandis, while Yang & Bradley's (1998) report \"showed no areas in
    the glans to be more densely innervated than others.\n\n\"Halata & Spathe (1997)
    reported; \"the glans penis contains a predominance of free nerve endings, numerous
    genital end bulbs and rarely Pacinian and Ruffinian corpuscles. \n\nMerkel nerve
    endings and Meissner's corpuscles are not present.\"Yang & Bradley argue; \"the
    distinct pattern of innervation of the glans emphasizes the role of the glans
    as a sensory structure\". \n\nSome researchers have suggested that the glans
    has evolved to become acorn, mushroom or cone shaped so that during copulation
    it acts to remove any semen still there from previous sex partners, but this
    is not supported when looking at primate relatives who have different mating
    behaviors.\n\n\n=== Clinical significance ===\n\nThe meatus (opening) of the
    urethra is located at the tip of the glans penis.\nThe epithelium of the glans
    penis is mucocutaneous tissue. \n\nBirley et al. report that excessive washing
    with soap may dry the mucous membrane which covers the glans penis and cause
    non-specific dermatitis.\n\nInflammation of the glans penis is known as balanitis,
    and, occurs in 3\u201311% of males (up to 35% of diabetic males). \n\nEdwards
    reported that it is generally more common in males who have poor hygiene habits
    or have not been circumcised. \n\nIt has many causes, including irritation, or
    infection with a wide variety of pathogens. \n\nCareful identification of the
    cause with the aid of patient history, physical examination, swabs and cultures,
    and biopsy are essential in order to determine the proper treatment.\n\nMeatal
    stenosis is a late complication of circumcision, which occurs in about 2 to 20
    percent of circumcised boys.\n\n\n== Other animals ==\n\nMale felids are able
    to urinate backwards by curving the tip of the glans penis backward. \n\nIn cats,
    the glans penis is covered with spines, but in dogs, the glans is smooth. \n\nPenile
    spines also occur on the glans of male and female spotted hyenas.In male dogs,
    the glans penis consists of two parts called the bulbus glandis and pars longa
    glandis. \n\nThe glans of a fossa's penis extends about halfway down the shaft
    and is spiny except at the tip. \n\nIn comparison, the glans of felids is short
    and spiny, while that of viverrids is smooth and long.\nThe shape of the glans
    varies among different marsupial species. \n\nIn most marsupials, the glans is
    divided, but male macropods have an undivided glans penis. \n\nThe glans penis
    is also divided into two parts in platypuses and echidnas.\n\nThe glans penis
    of the marsh rice rat is long and robust, averaging 7.3 mm (0.29 in) long and
    4.6 mm (0.18 in) broad.\n\nIn Thomasomys ucucha the glans penis is rounded, short,
    and small and is superficially divided into left and right halves by a trough
    at the top and a ridge at the bottom. \n\nMost of the glans is covered with spines,
    except for an area near the tip.\n\nWinkelmann's mouse can most readily be distinguished
    from its close relatives by its partially corrugated glans penis.\n\nWhen erect,
    the glans of a horse's penis increases by 3 to 4 times. \n\nThe urethra opens
    within the urethral fossa, a small pouch at the distal end of the glans. \n\nUnlike
    the human glans, the glans of a horse's penis extends backwards on its shaft.\n\nMales
    of Racey's pipistrelle bat have a narrow, egg-shaped glans penis.\n\nThe glans
    penis of a male cape ground squirrel is large with a prominent baculum.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glans_penis"

  descriptionText: "\n\nSUPERIOR LOBE OF LEFT LUNG/\nLUNG\n\n\nThe lungs are the
    primary organs of the respiratory system in humans and most other animals including
    a few fish, and some snails. \n\nIn mammals and most other vertebrates, two lungs
    are located near the backbone on either side of the heart. \n\nTheir function
    in the respiratory system is to extract oxygen from the air and transfer it into
    the bloodstream, and to release carbon dioxide from the bloodstream into the
    atmosphere, in a process of gas exchange. \n\nRespiration is driven by different
    muscular systems in different species. \n\nMammals, reptiles and birds use their
    different muscles to support and foster breathing. \n\nIn earlier tetrapods,
    air was driven into the lungs by the pharyngeal muscles via buccal pumping, a
    mechanism still seen in amphibians. \n\nIn humans, the main muscle of respiration
    that drives breathing is the diaphragm. \n\nThe lungs also provide airflow that
    makes vocal sounds including human speech possible.\nHumans have two lungs, a
    right lung, and a left lung. \n\nThey are situated within the thoracic cavity
    of the chest. \n\nThe right lung is bigger than the left, which shares space
    in the chest with the heart. \n\nThe lungs together weigh approximately 1.3 kilograms
    (2.9 lb), and the right is heavier. \n\nThe lungs are part of the lower respiratory
    tract that begins at the trachea and branches into the bronchi and bronchioles,
    and which receive air breathed in via the conducting zone. \n\nThe conducting
    zone ends at the terminal bronchioles. \n\nThese divide into the respiratory
    bronchioles of the respiratory zone which divide into alveolar ducts that give
    rise to the alveolar sacs that contain the alveoli, where gas exchange takes
    place. \n\nAlveoli are also sparsely present on the walls of the respiratory
    bronchioles and alveolar ducts. \n\nTogether, the lungs contain approximately
    2,400 kilometres (1,500 mi) of airways and 300 to 500 million alveoli. \n\nEach
    lung is enclosed within a pleural sac of two membranes called pleurae; the membranes
    are separated by a film of pleural fluid, which allows the inner and outer membranes
    to slide over each other whilst breathing takes place, without much friction.
    \n\nThe inner pleura also divides each lung into sections called lobes. \n\nThe
    right lung has three lobes and the left has two. \n\nThe lobes are further divided
    into bronchopulmonary segments and pulmonary lobules. \n\nThe lungs have a unique
    blood supply, receiving deoxygenated blood from the heart in the pulmonary circulation
    for the purposes of receiving oxygen and releasing carbon dioxide, and a separate
    supply of oxygenated blood to the tissue of the lungs, in the bronchial circulation.\nThe
    tissue of the lungs can be affected by a number of respiratory diseases, including
    pneumonia and lung cancer. \n\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease includes
    chronic bronchitis and emphysema, and can be related to smoking or exposure to
    harmful substances. \n\nA number of occupational lung diseases can be caused
    by substances such as coal dust, asbestos fibres, and crystalline silica dust.
    \n\nDiseases such as bronchitis can also affect the respiratory tract. \n\nMedical
    terms related to the lung often begin with pulmo-, from the Latin pulmonarius
    (of the lungs) as in pulmonology, or with pneumo- (from Greek \u03C0\u03BD\u03B5\u03CD\u03BC\u03C9\u03BD
    \"lung\") as in pneumonia.\nIn embryonic development, the lungs begin to develop
    as an outpouching of the foregut, a tube which goes on to form the upper part
    of the digestive system. \n\nWhen the lungs are formed the fetus is held in the
    fluid-filled amniotic sac and so they do not function to breathe. \n\nBlood is
    also diverted from the lungs through the ductus arteriosus. \n\nAt birth however,
    air begins to pass through the lungs, and the diversionary duct closes, so that
    the lungs can begin to respire. \n\nThe lungs only fully develop in early childhood.\n\n\n==
    Structure ==\n\n\n\n=== Anatomy ===\n\n\nThe lungs are located in the chest on
    either side of the heart in the rib cage. \n\nThey are conical in shape with
    a narrow rounded apex at the top, and a broad concave base that rests on the
    convex surface of the diaphragm. \n\nThe apex of the lung extends into the root
    of the neck, reaching shortly above the level of the sternal end of the first
    rib. \n\nThe lungs stretch from close to the backbone in the rib cage to the
    front of the chest and downwards from the lower part of the trachea to the diaphragm.
    \n\nThe left lung shares space with the heart, and has an indentation in its
    border called the cardiac notch of the left lung to accommodate this. \n\nThe
    front and outer sides of the lungs face the ribs, which make light indentations
    on their surfaces. \n\nThe medial surfaces of the lungs face towards the centre
    of the chest, and lie against the heart, great vessels, and the carina where
    the trachea divides into the two main bronchi. \n\nThe cardiac impression is
    an indentation formed on the surfaces of the lungs where they rest against the
    heart.\nBoth lungs have a central recession called the hilum at the root of the
    lung, where the blood vessels and airways pass into the lungs. \n\nThere are
    also bronchopulmonary lymph nodes on the hilum.The lungs are surrounded by the
    pulmonary pleurae. \n\nThe pleurae are two serous membranes; the outer parietal
    pleura lines the inner wall of the rib cage and the inner visceral pleura directly
    lines the surface of the lungs. \n\nBetween the pleurae is a potential space
    called the pleural cavity containing a thin layer of lubricating pleural fluid.\n\n\n====
    Lobes ====\nEach lung is divided into sections called lobes by the infoldings
    of the visceral pleura as fissures. \n\nLobes are divided into segments, and
    segments have further divisions as lobules. \n\nThere are three lobes in the
    right lung and two lobes in the left lung. \n\n\n==== Fissures ====\nThe fissures
    are formed in early prenatal development by invaginations of the visceral pleura
    that divide the lobar bronchi, and section the lungs into lobes that helps in
    their expansion. \n\nThe right lung is divided into three lobes by a horizontal
    fissure, and an oblique fissure. \n\nThe left lung is divided into two lobes
    by an oblique fissure which is closely aligned with the oblique fissure in the
    right lung. \n\nIn the right lung the upper horizontal fissure, separates the
    upper (superior) lobe from the middle lobe. \n\nThe lower, oblique fissure separates
    the lower lobe from the middle and upper lobes.Variations in the fissures are
    fairly common being either incompletely formed \nor present as an extra fissure
    as in the azygos fissure, or absent. \n\nIncomplete fissures are responsible
    for interlobar collateral ventilation, airflow between lobes which is unwanted
    in some lung volume reduction procedures.\n\n\n==== Segments ====\nThe main or
    primary bronchi enter the lungs at the hilum and initially branch into secondary
    bronchi also known as lobar bronchi that supply air to each lobe of the lung.
    \n\nThe lobar bronchi branch into tertiary bronchi also known as segmental bronchi
    and these supply air to the further divisions of the lobes known as bronchopulmonary
    segments. \n\nEach bronchopulmonary segment has its own (segmental) bronchus
    and arterial supply. \n\nSegments for the left and right lung are shown in the
    table. \n\nThe segmental anatomy is useful clinically for localising disease
    processes in the lungs. \n\nA segment is a discrete unit that can be surgically
    removed without seriously affecting surrounding tissue.\n\n\n=== Right lung ===\n\nThe
    right lung has both more lobes and segments than the left. \n\nIt is divided
    into three lobes, an upper, middle, and a lower lobe by two fissures, one oblique
    and one horizontal. \n\nThe upper, horizontal fissure, separates the upper from
    the middle lobe. \n\nIt begins in the lower oblique fissure near the posterior
    border of the lung, and, running horizontally forward, cuts the anterior border
    on a level with the sternal end of the fourth costal cartilage; on the mediastinal
    surface it may be traced back to the hilum. \n\nThe lower, oblique fissure, separates
    the lower from the middle and upper lobes and is closely aligned with the oblique
    fissure in the left lung.The mediastinal surface of the right lung is indented
    by a number of nearby structures. \n\nThe heart sits in an impression called
    the cardiac impression. \n\nAbove the hilum of the lung is an arched groove for
    the azygos vein, and above this is a wide groove for the superior vena cava and
    right brachiocephalic vein; behind this, and close to the top of the lung is
    a groove for the brachiocephalic artery. \n\nThere is a groove for the esophagus
    behind the hilum and the pulmonary ligament, and near the lower part of the esophageal
    groove is a deeper groove for the inferior vena cava before it enters the heart.The
    weight of the right lung varies between individuals, with a standard reference
    range in men of 155\u2013720 g (0.342\u20131.587 lb) and in women of 100\u2013590
    g (0.22\u20131.30 lb).\n\n\n=== Left lung ===\n\nThe left lung is divided into
    two lobes, an upper and a lower lobe, by the oblique fissure, which extends from
    the costal to the mediastinal surface of the lung both above and below the hilum.
    \n\nThe left lung, unlike the right, does not have a middle lobe, though it does
    have a homologous feature, a projection of the upper lobe termed the lingula.
    \n\nIts name means \"little tongue\". \n\nThe lingula on the left lung serves
    as an anatomic parallel to the middle lobe on the right lung, with both areas
    being predisposed to similar infections and anatomic complications. \n\nThere
    are two bronchopulmonary segments of the lingula: superior and inferior.The mediastinal
    surface of the left lung has a large cardiac impression where the heart sits.
    \n\nThis is deeper and larger than that on the right lung, at which level the
    heart projects to the left.On the same surface, immediately above the hilum,
    is a well-marked curved groove for the aortic arch, and a groove below it for
    the descending aorta. \n\nThe left subclavian artery, a branch off the aortic
    arch, sits in a groove from the arch to near the apex of the lung. \n\nA shallower
    groove in front of the artery and near the edge of the lung, lodges the left
    brachiocephalic vein. \n\nThe esophagus may sit in a wider shallow impression
    at the base of the lung.The weight of the left lung, by standard reference range,
    in men is 110\u2013675 g (0.243\u20131.488 lb) in women 105\u2013515 g (0.231\u20131.135
    lb).\n\n\n== Microanatomy ==\n\n\nThe lungs are part of the lower respiratory
    tract, and accommodate the bronchial airways when they branch from the trachea.
    \n\nThe bronchial airways terminate in alveoli which make up the functional tissue
    (parenchyma) of the lung, and veins, arteries, nerves, and lymphatic vessels.
    \n\nThe trachea and bronchi have plexuses of lymph capillaries in their mucosa
    and submucosa. \n\nThe smaller bronchi have a single layer of lymph capillaries,
    and they are absent in the alveoli. \n\nThe lungs are supplied with the largest
    lymphatic drainage system of any other organ in the body. \n\nEach lung is surrounded
    by a serous membrane of visceral pleura, which has an underlying layer of loose
    connective tissue attached to the substance of the lung.\n\n\n=== Connective
    tissue ===\n\nThe connective tissue of the lungs is made up of elastic and collagen
    fibres that are interspersed between the capillaries and the alveolar walls.
    \n\nElastin is the key protein of the extracellular matrix and is the main component
    of the elastic fibres. \n\nElastin gives the necessary elasticity and resilience
    required for the persistent stretching involved in breathing, known as lung compliance.
    \n\nIt is also responsible for the elastic recoil needed. \n\nElastin is more
    concentrated in areas of high stress such as the openings of the alveoli, and
    alveolar junctions. \n\nThe connective tissue links all the alveoli to form the
    lung parenchyma which has a sponge-like appearance. \n\nThe alveoli have interconnecting
    air passages in their walls known as the pores of Kohn.\n\n\n=== Respiratory
    epithelium ===\n\n\nAll of the lower respiratory tract including the trachea,
    bronchi, and bronchioles is lined with respiratory epithelium. \n\nThis is a
    ciliated epithelium interspersed with goblet cells which produce mucin the main
    component of mucus, ciliated cells, basal cells, and in the terminal bronchioles\u2013club
    cells with actions similar to basal cells, and macrophages. \n\nThe epithelial
    cells, and the submucosal glands throughout the respiratory tract secrete airway
    surface liquid (ASL), the composition of which is tightly regulated and determines
    how well mucociliary clearance works.Pulmonary neuroendocrine cells are found
    throughout the respiratory epithelium including the alveolar epithelium, though
    they only account for around 0.5 per cent of the total epithelial population.
    \n\nPNECs are innervated airway epithelial cells that are particularly focused
    at airway junction points. \n\nThese cells can produce serotonin, dopamine, and
    norepinephrine, as well as polypeptide products. \n\nCytoplasmic processes from
    the pulmonary neuroendocrine cells extend into the airway lumen where they may
    sense the composition of inspired gas.\n\n\n=== Bronchial airways ===\n\nIn the
    bronchi there are incomplete tracheal rings of cartilage and smaller plates of
    cartilage that keep them open.:\u200A472\u200A Bronchioles are too narrow to
    support cartilage and their walls are of smooth muscle, and this is largely absent
    in the narrower respiratory bronchioles which are mainly just of epithelium.:\u200A472\u200A
    The absence of cartilage in the terminal bronchioles gives them an alternative
    name of membranous bronchioles.\n\n\n=== Respiratory zone ===\n\nThe conducting
    zone of the respiratory tract ends at the terminal bronchioles when they branch
    into the respiratory bronchioles. \n\nThis marks the beginning of the terminal
    respiratory unit called the acinus which includes the respiratory bronchioles,
    the alveolar ducts, alveolar sacs, and alveoli. \n\nAn acinus measures up to
    10 mm in diameter. \n\nA primary pulmonary lobule is that part of the acinus
    that includes the alveolar ducts, sacs, and alveoli but does not include the
    respiratory bronchioles. \n\nThe unit described as the secondary pulmonary lobule
    is the lobule most referred to as the pulmonary lobule or respiratory lobule.:\u200A489\u200A
    This lobule is a discrete unit that is the smallest component of the lung that
    can be seen without aid. \n\nThe secondary pulmonary lobule is likely to be made
    up of between 30 and 50 primary lobules. \n\nThe lobule is supplied by a terminal
    bronchiole that branches into respiratory bronchioles. \n\nThe respiratory bronchioles
    supply the alveoli in each acinus and is accompanied by a pulmonary artery branch.
    \n\nEach lobule is enclosed by an interlobular septa. \n\nEach acinus is incompletely
    separated by an interlobular septa.The respiratory bronchiole gives rise to the
    alveolar ducts that lead to the alveolar sacs, which contain two or more alveoli.
    \n\nThe walls of the alveoli are extremely thin allowing a fast rate of diffusion.
    \n\nThe alveoli have interconnecting small air passages in their walls known
    as the pores of Kohn.\n\n\n=== Alveoli ===\n\n\nAlveoli consist of two types
    of alveolar cell and an alveolar macrophage. \n\nThe two types of cell are known
    as type I and type II cells (also known as pneumocytes). \n\nTypes I and II make
    up the walls and alveolar septa. \n\nType I cells provide 95% of the surface
    area of each alveoli and are flat (\"squamous\"), and Type II cells generally
    cluster in the corners of the alveoli and have a cuboidal shape. \n\nDespite
    this, cells occur in a roughly equal ratio of 1:1 or 6:4.Type I are squamous
    epithelial cells that make up the alveolar wall structure. \n\nThey have extremely
    thin walls that enable an easy gas exchange. \n\nThese type I cells also make
    up the alveolar septa which separate each alveolus. \n\nThe septa consist of
    an epithelial lining and associated basement membranes. \n\nType I cells are
    not able to divide, and consequently rely on differentiation from Type II cells.Type
    II are larger and they line the alveoli and produce and secrete epithelial lining
    fluid, and lung surfactant. \n\nType II cells are able to divide and differentiate
    to Type I cells.The alveolar macrophages have an important role in the immune
    system. \n\nThey remove substances which deposit in the alveoli including loose
    red blood cells that have been forced out from blood vessels.\n\n\n=== Microbiota
    ===\n\n\nThere is a large presence of microorganisms in the lungs known as the
    lung microbiota that interacts with the airway epithelial cells; an interaction
    of probable importance in maintaining homeostasis. \n\nThe microbiota is complex
    and dynamic in healthy people, and altered in diseases such as asthma and COPD.
    \n\nFor example significant changes can take place in COPD following infection
    with rhinovirus. \n\nFungal genera that are commonly found as mycobiota in the
    microbiota include Candida, Malassezia, Saccharomyces, and Aspergillus.\n\n\n===
    Respiratory tract ===\n\n\nThe lower respiratory tract is part of the respiratory
    system, and consists of the trachea and the structures below this including the
    lungs. \n\nThe trachea receives air from the pharynx and travels down to a place
    where it splits (the carina) into a right and left primary bronchus. \n\nThese
    supply air to the right and left lungs, splitting progressively into the secondary
    and tertiary bronchi for the lobes of the lungs, and into smaller and smaller
    bronchioles until they become the respiratory bronchioles. \n\nThese in turn
    supply air through alveolar ducts into the alveoli, where the exchange of gases
    take place. \n\nOxygen breathed in, diffuses through the walls of the alveoli
    into the enveloping capillaries and into the circulation, and carbon dioxide
    diffuses from the blood into the lungs to be breathed out.\nEstimates of the
    total surface area of lungs vary from 50 to 75 square metres (540 to 810 sq ft);
    although this is often quoted in textbooks and the media being \"the size of
    a tennis court\", it is actually less than half the size of a singles court.The
    bronchi in the conducting zone are reinforced with hyaline cartilage in order
    to hold open the airways. \n\nThe bronchioles have no cartilage and are surrounded
    instead by smooth muscle. \n\nAir is warmed to 37 \xB0C (99 \xB0F), humidified
    and cleansed by the conducting zone. \n\nParticles from the air being removed
    by the cilia on the respiratory epithelium lining the passageways, in a process
    called mucociliary clearance.\nPulmonary stretch receptors in the smooth muscle
    of the airways initiate a reflex known as the Hering\u2013Breuer reflex that
    prevents the lungs from over-inflation, during forceful inspiration.\n\n\n===
    Blood supply ===\n\n\nThe lungs have a dual blood supply provided by a bronchial
    and a pulmonary circulation. \n\nThe bronchial circulation supplies oxygenated
    blood to the airways of the lungs, through the bronchial arteries that leave
    the aorta. \n\nThere are usually three arteries, two to the left lung and one
    to the right, and they branch alongside the bronchi and bronchioles. \n\nThe
    pulmonary circulation carries deoxygenated blood from the heart to the lungs
    and returns the oxygenated blood to the heart to supply the rest of the body.The
    blood volume of the lungs is about 450 millilitres on average, about 9% of the
    total blood volume of the entire circulatory system. \n\nThis quantity can easily
    fluctuate from between one-half and twice the normal volume. \n\nAlso, in the
    event of blood loss through hemorrhage, blood from the lungs can partially compensate
    by automatically transferring to the systemic circulation.\n\n\n=== Nerve supply
    ===\n\nThe lungs are supplied by nerves of the autonomic nervous system. \n\nInput
    from the parasympathetic nervous system occurs via the vagus nerve. \n\nWhen
    stimulated by acetylcholine, this causes constriction of the smooth muscle lining
    the bronchus and bronchioles, and increases the secretions from glands. \n\nThe
    lungs also have a sympathetic tone from norepinephrine acting on the beta 2 adrenoceptors
    in the respiratory tract, which causes bronchodilation.The action of breathing
    takes place because of nerve signals sent by the respiratory center in the brainstem,
    along the phrenic nerve from the cervical plexus to the diaphragm.\n\n\n=== Variation
    ===\n\nThe lobes of the lung are subject to anatomical variations. \n\nA horizontal
    interlobar fissure was found to be incomplete in 25% of right lungs, or even
    absent in 11% of all cases. \n\nAn accessory fissure was also found in 14% and
    22% of left and right lungs, respectively. \n\nAn oblique fissure was found to
    be incomplete in 21% to 47% of left lungs. \n\nIn some cases a fissure is absent,
    or extra, resulting in a right lung with only two lobes, or a left lung with
    three lobes.A variation in the airway branching structure has been found specifically
    in the central airway\nbranching. \n\nThis variation is associated with the development
    of COPD in adulthood.\n\n\n== Development ==\n\n\nThe development of the human
    lungs arise from the laryngotracheal groove and develop to maturity over several
    weeks in the foetus and for several years following birth.The larynx, trachea,
    bronchi and lungs that make up the respiratory tract, begin to form during the
    fourth week of embryogenesis from the lung bud which appears ventrally to the
    caudal portion of the foregut.\n\nThe respiratory tract has a branching structure,
    and is also known as the respiratory tree. \n\nIn the embryo this structure is
    developed in the process of branching morphogenesis, and is generated by the
    repeated splitting of the tip of the branch. \n\nIn the development of the lungs
    (as in some other organs) the epithelium forms branching tubes. \n\nThe lung
    has a left-right symmetry and each bud known as a bronchial bud grows out as
    a tubular epithelium that becomes a bronchus. \n\nEach bronchus branches into
    bronchioles. \n\nThe branching is a result of the tip of each tube bifurcating.
    \n\nThe branching process forms the bronchi, bronchioles, and ultimately the
    alveoli. \n\nThe four genes mostly associated with branching morphogenesis in
    the lung are the intercellular signalling protein \u2013 sonic hedgehog (SHH),
    fibroblast growth factors FGF10 and FGFR2b, and bone morphogenetic protein BMP4.
    \n\nFGF10 is seen to have the most prominent role. \n\nFGF10 is a paracrine signalling
    molecule needed for epithelial branching, and SHH inhibits FGF10. \n\nThe development
    of the alveoli is influenced by a different mechanism whereby continued bifurcation
    is stopped and the distal tips become dilated to form the alveoli.\nAt the end
    of the fourth week the lung bud divides into two, the right and left primary
    bronchial buds on each side of the trachea. \n\nDuring the fifth week the right
    bud branches into three secondary bronchial buds and the left branches into two
    secondary bronchial buds. \n\nThese give rise to the lobes of the lungs, three
    on the right and two on the left. \n\nOver the following week, the secondary
    buds branch into tertiary buds, about ten on each side. \n\nFrom the sixth week
    to the sixteenth week, the major elements of the lungs appear except the alveoli.
    \n\nFrom week 16 to week 26, the bronchi enlarge and lung tissue becomes highly
    vascularised. \n\nBronchioles and alveolar ducts also develop. \n\nBy week 26
    the terminal bronchioles have formed which branch into two respiratory bronchioles.
    \n\nDuring the period covering the 26th week until birth the important blood\u2013air
    barrier is established. \n\nSpecialised type I alveolar cells where gas exchange
    will take place, together with the type II alveolar cells that secrete pulmonary
    surfactant, appear. \n\nThe surfactant reduces the surface tension at the air-alveolar
    surface which allows expansion of the alveolar sacs. \n\nThe alveolar sacs contain
    the primitive alveoli that form at the end of the alveolar ducts,\nand their
    appearance around the seventh month marks the point at which limited respiration
    would be possible, and the premature baby could survive.\n\n\n=== Vitamin A deficiency
    ===\n\n\nThe developing lung is particularly vulnerable to changes in the levels
    of vitamin A. \n\nVitamin A deficiency has been linked to changes in the epithelial
    lining of the lung and in the lung parenchyma. \n\nThis can disrupt the normal
    physiology of the lung and predispose to respiratory diseases. \n\nSevere nutritional
    deficiency in vitamin A results in a reduction in the formation of the alveolar
    walls (septa) and to notable changes in the respiratory epithelium; alterations
    are noted in the extracellular matrix and in the protein content of the basement
    membrane. \n\nThe extracellular matrix maintains lung elasticity; the basement
    membrane is associated with alveolar epithelium and is important in the blood-air
    barrier. \n\nThe deficiency is associated with functional defects and disease
    states. \n\nVitamin A is crucial in the development of the alveoli which continues
    for several years after birth.\n\n\n=== After birth ===\n\nAt birth, the baby's
    lungs are filled with fluid secreted by the lungs and are not inflated. \n\nAfter
    birth the infant's central nervous system reacts to the sudden change in temperature
    and environment. \n\nThis triggers the first breath, within about 10 seconds
    after delivery. \n\nBefore birth, the lungs are filled with fetal lung fluid.  
    After the first breath, the fluid is quickly absorbed into the body or exhaled.
    \n\nThe resistance in the lung's blood vessels decreases giving an increased
    surface area for gas exchange, and the lungs begin to breathe spontaneously.
    \n\nThis accompanies other changes which result in an increased amount of blood
    entering the lung tissues.At birth the lungs are very undeveloped with only around
    one sixth of the alveoli of the adult lung present. \n\nThe alveoli continue
    to form into early adulthood, and their ability to form when necessary is seen
    in the regeneration of the lung. \n\nAlveolar septa have a double capillary network
    instead of the single network of the developed lung. \n\nOnly after the maturation
    of the capillary network can the lung enter a normal phase of growth. \n\nFollowing
    the early growth in numbers of alveoli there is another stage of the alveoli
    being enlarged.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\n\n\n=== Gas exchange ===\n\nThe major
    function of the lungs is gas exchange between the lungs and the blood. \n\nThe
    alveolar and pulmonary capillary gases equilibrate across the thin blood\u2013air
    barrier. \n\nThis thin membrane (about 0.5 \u20132 \u03BCm thick) is folded into
    about 300 million alveoli, providing an extremely large surface area (estimates
    varying between 70 and 145 m2) for gas exchange to occur.\n\nThe lungs are not
    capable of expanding to breathe on their own, and will only do so when there
    is an increase in the volume of the thoracic cavity. \n\nThis is achieved by
    the muscles of respiration, through the contraction of the diaphragm, and the
    intercostal muscles which pull the rib cage upwards as shown in the diagram.
    \n\nDuring breathing out the muscles relax, returning the lungs to their resting
    position. \n\nAt this point the lungs contain the functional residual capacity
    (FRC) of air, which, in the adult human, has a volume of about 2.5\u20133.0 litres.During
    heavy breathing as in exertion, a large number of accessory muscles in the neck
    and abdomen are recruited, that during exhalation pull the ribcage down, decreasing
    the volume of the thoracic cavity. \n\nThe FRC is now decreased, but since the
    lungs cannot be emptied completely there is still about a litre of residual air
    left. \n\nLung function testing is carried out to evaluate lung volumes and capacities.\n\n\n===
    Protection ===\n\nThe lungs possess several characteristics which protect against
    infection. \n\nThe respiratory tract is lined by respiratory epithelium or respiratory
    mucosa, with hair-like projections called cilia that beat rhythmically and carry
    mucus. \n\nThis mucociliary clearance is an important defence system against
    air-borne infection. \n\nThe dust particles and bacteria in the inhaled air are
    caught in the mucosal surface of the airways, and are moved up towards the pharynx
    by the rhythmic upward beating action of the cilia.:\u200A661\u2013730\u200A
    The lining of the lung also secretes immunoglobulin A which protects against
    respiratory infections; goblet cells secrete mucus which also contains several
    antimicrobial compounds such as defensins, antiproteases, and antioxidants. \n\nA
    rare type of specialised cell called a pulmonary ionocyte that is suggested may
    regulate mucus viscosity has been described. \n\nIn addition, the lining of the
    lung also contains macrophages, immune cells which engulf and destroy debris
    and microbes that enter the lung in a process known as phagocytosis; and dendritic
    cells which present antigens to activate components of the adaptive immune system
    such as T cells and B cells.The size of the respiratory tract and the flow of
    air also protect the lungs from larger particles. \n\nSmaller particles deposit
    in the mouth and behind the mouth in the oropharynx, and larger particles are
    trapped in nasal hair after inhalation.\n\n\n=== Other ===\n\nIn addition to
    their function in respiration, the lungs have a number of other functions. \n\nThey
    are involved in maintaining homeostasis, helping in the regulation of blood pressure
    as part of the renin\u2013angiotensin system. \n\nThe inner lining of the blood
    vessels secretes angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) an enzyme that catalyses
    the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. \n\nThe lungs are involved
    in the blood's acid\u2013base homeostasis by expelling carbon dioxide when breathing.The
    lungs also serve a protective role. \n\nSeveral blood-borne substances, such
    as a few types of prostaglandins, leukotrienes, serotonin and bradykinin, are
    excreted through the lungs. \n\nDrugs and other substances can be absorbed, modified
    or excreted in the lungs. \n\nThe lungs filter out small blood clots from veins
    and prevent them from entering arteries and causing strokes.The lungs also play
    a pivotal role in speech by providing air and airflow for the creation of vocal
    sounds, and other paralanguage communications such as sighs and gasps.\nResearch
    suggests a role of the lungs in the production of blood platelets.\n\n\n== Gene
    and protein expression ==\n\n\nAbout 20,000 protein coding genes are expressed
    in human cells and almost 75% of these genes are expressed in the normal lung.
    \n\nA little less than 200 of these genes are more specifically expressed in
    the lung with less than 20 genes being highly lung specific. \n\nThe highest
    expression of lung specific proteins are different surfactant proteins, such
    as SFTPA1, SFTPB and SFTPC, and napsin, expressed in type II pneumocytes. \n\nOther
    proteins with elevated expression in the lung are the dynein protein DNAH5 in
    ciliated cells, and the secreted SCGB1A1 protein in mucus-secreting goblet cells
    of the airway mucosa.\n\n\n== Clinical significance ==\n\n\nLungs can be affected
    by a number of diseases and disorders. \n\nPulmonology is the medical speciality
    that deals with respiratory diseases involving the lungs and respiratory system.
    \n\nCardiothoracic surgery deals with surgery of the lungs including lung volume
    reduction surgery, lobectomy, pneumectomy and lung transplantation.\n\n\n===
    Inflammation and infection ===\n\nInflammatory conditions of the lung tissue
    are pneumonia, of the respiratory tract are bronchitis and bronchiolitis, and
    of the pleurae surrounding the lungs pleurisy. \n\nInflammation is usually caused
    by infections due to bacteria or viruses. \n\nWhen the lung tissue is inflamed
    due to other causes it is called pneumonitis. \n\nOne major cause of bacterial
    pneumonia is tuberculosis. \n\nChronic infections often occur in those with immunodeficiency
    and can include a fungal infection by Aspergillus fumigatus that can lead to
    an aspergilloma forming in the lung.Alcohol affects the lungs and can cause inflammatory
    alcoholic lung disease. \n\nAcute exposure to alcohol stimulates the beating
    of cilia in the respiratory epithelium. \n\nHowever, chronic exposure has the
    effect of desensitising the ciliary response which reduces mucociliary clearance
    (MCC). \n\nMCC is an innate defense system protecting against pollutants and
    pathogens, and when this is disrupted the numbers of alveolar macrophages are
    decreased. \n\nA subsequent inflammatory response is the release of cytokines.
    \n\nAnother consequence is the susceptibility to infection.\n\n\n=== Blood-supply
    changes ===\n\n\nA pulmonary embolism is a blood clot that becomes lodged in
    the pulmonary arteries. \n\nThe majority of emboli arise because of deep vein
    thrombosis in the legs. \n\nPulmonary emboli may be investigated using a ventilation/perfusion
    scan, a CT scan of the arteries of the lung, or blood tests such as the D-dimer.
    \n\nPulmonary hypertension describes an increased pressure at the beginning of
    the pulmonary artery that has a large number of differing causes. \n\nOther rarer
    conditions may also affect the blood supply of the lung, such as granulomatosis
    with polyangiitis, which causes inflammation of the small blood vessels of the
    lungs and kidneys.A lung contusion is a bruise caused by chest trauma. \n\nIt
    results in hemorrhage of the alveoli causing a build-up of fluid which can impair
    breathing, and this can be either mild or severe.\nThe function of the lungs
    can also be affected by compression from fluid in the pleural cavity pleural
    effusion, or other substances such as air (pneumothorax), blood (hemothorax),
    or rarer causes. \n\nThese may be investigated using a chest X-ray or CT scan,
    and may require the insertion of a surgical drain until the underlying cause
    is identified and treated.\n\n\n=== Obstructive lung diseases ===\n\n\nAsthma,
    chronic bronchitis, bronchiectasis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
    (COPD) are all obstructive lung diseases characterised by airway obstruction.
    \n\nThis limits the amount of air that is able to enter alveoli because of constriction
    of the bronchial tree, due to inflammation. \n\nObstructive lung diseases are
    often identified because of symptoms and diagnosed with pulmonary function tests
    such as spirometry. \n\nMany obstructive lung diseases are managed by avoiding
    triggers (such as dust mites or smoking), with symptom control such as bronchodilators,
    and with suppression of inflammation (such as through corticosteroids) in severe
    cases. \n\nA common cause of chronic bronchitis, and emphysema, is smoking; and
    common causes of bronchiectasis include severe infections and cystic fibrosis.
    \n\nThe definitive cause of asthma is not yet known.The breakdown of alveolar
    tissue, often as a result of tobacco-smoking leads to emphysema, which can become
    severe enough to develop into COPD. \n\nElastase breaks down the elastin in the
    lung's connective tissue that can also result in emphysema. \n\nElastase is inhibited
    by the acute-phase protein, alpha-1 antitrypsin, and when there is a deficiency
    in this, emphysema can develop. \n\nWith persistent stress from smoking, the
    airway basal cells become disarranged and lose their regenerative ability needed
    to repair the epithelial barrier. \n\nThe disorganised basal cells are seen to
    be responsible for the major airway changes that are characteristic of COPD,
    and with continued stress can undergo a malignant transformation. \n\nStudies
    have shown that the initial development of emphysema is centred on the early
    changes in the airway epithelium of the small airways. \n\nBasal cells become
    further deranged in a smoker's transition to clinically defined COPD.\n\n\n===
    Restrictive lung diseases ===\n\nSome types of chronic lung diseases are classified
    as restrictive lung disease, because of a restriction in the amount of lung tissue
    involved in respiration. \n\nThese include pulmonary fibrosis which can occur
    when the lung is inflamed for a long period of time. \n\nFibrosis in the lung
    replaces functioning lung tissue with fibrous connective tissue. \n\nThis can
    be due to a large variety of occupational lung diseases such as Coalworker's
    pneumoconiosis, autoimmune diseases or more rarely to a reaction to medication.
    \n\nSevere respiratory disorders, where spontaneous breathing is not enough to
    maintain life, may need the use of mechanical ventilation to ensure an adequate
    supply of air.\n\n\n=== Cancers ===\n\nLung cancer can either arise directly
    from lung tissue or as a result of metastasis from another part of the body.
    \n\nThere are two main types of primary tumour described as either small-cell
    or non-small-cell lung carcinomas. \n\nThe major risk factor for cancer is smoking.
    \n\nOnce a cancer is identified it is staged using scans such as a CT scan and
    a sample of tissue from a biopsy is taken. \n\nCancers may be treated surgically
    by removing the tumour, the use of radiotherapy, chemotherapy or a combination,
    or with the aim of symptom control. \n\nLung cancer screening is being recommended
    in the United States for high-risk populations.\n\n\n=== Congenital disorders
    ===\n\nCongenital disorders include cystic fibrosis, pulmonary hypoplasia (an
    incomplete development of the lungs)congenital diaphragmatic hernia, and infant
    respiratory distress syndrome caused by a deficiency in lung surfactant. \n\nAn
    azygos lobe is a congenital anatomical variation which though usually without
    effect can cause problems in thoracoscopic procedures.\n\n\n=== Others ===\n\nA
    pneumothorax (collapsed lung) is an abnormal collection of air in the pleural
    space that causes an uncoupling of the lung from the chest wall. \n\nThe lung
    cannot expand against the air pressure inside the pleural space. \n\nAn easy
    to understand example is a traumatic pneumothorax, where air enters the pleural
    space from outside the body, as occurs with puncture to the chest wall. \n\nSimilarly,
    scuba divers ascending while holding their breath with their lungs fully inflated
    can cause air sacs (alveoli) to burst and leak high pressure air into the pleural
    space.\n\n\n=== Lung examination ===\n\n\nAs part of a physical examination in
    response to respiratory symptoms of shortness of breath, and cough, a lung examination
    may be carried out. \n\nThis exam includes palpation and auscultation. \n\nThe
    areas of the lungs that can be listened to using a stethoscope are called the
    lung fields, and these are the posterior, lateral, and anterior lung fields.
    \n\nThe posterior fields can be listened to from the back and include: the lower
    lobes (taking up three quarters of the posterior fields); the anterior fields
    taking up the other quarter; and the lateral fields under the axillae, the left
    axilla for the lingual, the right axilla for the middle right lobe. \n\nThe anterior
    fields can also be auscultated from the front. \n\nAbnormal breathing sounds
    heard during a lung exam can indicate the presence of a lung condition; wheezing
    for example is commonly associated with asthma and COPD.\n\n\n=== Lung function
    testing ===\n\n\nLung function testing is carried out by evaluating a person's
    capacity to inhale and exhale in different circumstances. \n\nThe volume of air
    inhaled and exhaled by a person at rest is the tidal volume (normally 500-750mL);
    the inspiratory reserve volume and expiratory reserve volume are the additional
    amounts a person is able to forcibly inhale and exhale respectively. \n\nThe
    summed total of forced inspiration and expiration is a person's vital capacity.
    \n\nNot all air is expelled from the lungs even after a forced breath out; the
    remainder of the air is called the residual volume. \n\nTogether these terms
    are referred to as lung volumes.Pulmonary plethysmographs are used to measure
    functional residual capacity. \n\nFunctional residual capacity cannot be measured
    by tests that rely on breathing out, as a person is only able to breathe a maximum
    of 80% of their total functional capacity. \n\nThe total lung capacity depends
    on the person's age, height, weight, and sex, and normally ranges between 4 and
    6 litres. \n\nFemales tend to have a 20\u201325% lower capacity than males. \n\nTall
    people tend to have a larger total lung capacity than shorter people. \n\nSmokers
    have a lower capacity than nonsmokers. \n\nThinner persons tend to have a larger
    capacity. \n\nLung capacity can be increased by physical training as much as
    40% but the effect may be modified by exposure to air pollution.Other lung function
    tests include spirometry, measuring the amount (volume) and flow of air that
    can be inhaled and exhaled. \n\nThe maximum volume of breath that can be exhaled
    is called the vital capacity. \n\nIn particular, how much a person is able to
    exhale in one second (called forced expiratory volume (FEV1)) as a proportion
    of how much they are able to exhale in total (FEV). \n\nThis ratio, the FEV1/FEV
    ratio, is important to distinguish whether a lung disease is restrictive or obstructive.
    \n\nAnother test is that of the lung's diffusing capacity \u2013 this is a measure
    of the transfer of gas from air to the blood in the lung capillaries.\n\n\n==
    Other animals ==\n\n\n\n=== Birds ===\n\n\n \nThe lungs of birds are relatively
    small, but are connected to 8 or 9 air sacs that extend through much of the body,
    and are in turn connected to air spaces within the bones. \n\nOn inhalation,
    air travels through the trachea of a bird into the air sacs. \n\nAir then travels
    continuously from the air sacs at the back, through the lungs, which are relatively
    fixed in size, to the air sacs at the front. \n\nFrom here, the air is exhaled.
    \n\nThese fixed size lungs are called \"circulatory lungs\", as distinct from
    the \"bellows-type lungs\" found in most other animals.The lungs of birds contain
    millions of tiny parallel passages called parabronchi. \n\nSmall sacs called
    atria radiate from the walls of the tiny passages; these, like the alveoli in
    other lungs, are the site of gas exchange by simple diffusion. \n\nThe blood
    flow around the parabronchi and their atria forms a cross-current process of
    gas exchange (see diagram on the right).The air sacs, which hold air, do not
    contribute much to gas exchange, despite being thin-walled, as they are poorly
    vascularised. \n\nThe air sacs expand and contract due to changes in the volume
    in the thorax and abdomen. \n\nThis volume change is caused by the movement of
    the sternum and ribs and this movement is often synchronised with movement of
    the flight muscles.Parabronchi in which the air flow is unidirectional are called
    paleopulmonic parabronchi and are found in all birds. \n\nSome birds, however,
    have, in addition, a lung structure where the air flow in the parabronchi is
    bidirectional. \n\nThese are termed neopulmonic parabronchi.\n\n\n=== Reptiles
    ===\n\n\nThe lungs of most reptiles have a single bronchus running down the centre,
    from which numerous branches reach out to individual pockets throughout the lungs.
    \n\nThese pockets are similar to alveoli in mammals, but much larger and fewer
    in number. \n\nThese give the lung a sponge-like texture. \n\nIn tuataras, snakes,
    and some lizards, the lungs are simpler in structure, similar to that of typical
    amphibians.Snakes and limbless lizards typically possess only the right lung
    as a major respiratory organ; the left lung is greatly reduced, or even absent.
    \n\nAmphisbaenians, however, have the opposite arrangement, with a major left
    lung, and a reduced or absent right lung.Both crocodilians and monitor lizards
    have developed lungs similar to those of birds, providing a unidirectional airflow
    and even possessing air sacs. \n\nThe now extinct pterosaurs have seemingly even
    further refined this type of lung, extending the airsacs into the wing membranes
    and, in the case of lonchodectids, tupuxuara, and azhdarchoids, the hindlimbs.Reptilian
    lungs typically receive air via expansion and contraction of the ribs driven
    by axial muscles and buccal pumping. \n\nCrocodilians also rely on the hepatic
    piston method, in which the liver is pulled back by a muscle anchored to the
    pubic bone (part of the pelvis) called the diaphragmaticus, which in turn creates
    negative pressure in the crocodile's thoracic cavity, allowing air to be moved
    into the lungs by Boyle's law. \n\nTurtles, which are unable to move their ribs,
    instead use their forelimbs and pectoral girdle to force air in and out of the
    lungs.\n\n\n=== Amphibians ===\n\n\nThe lungs of most frogs and other amphibians
    are simple and balloon-like, with gas exchange limited to the outer surface of
    the lung. \n\nThis is not very efficient, but amphibians have low metabolic demands
    and can also quickly dispose of carbon dioxide by diffusion across their skin
    in water, and supplement their oxygen supply by the same method. \n\nAmphibians
    employ a positive pressure system to get air to their lungs, forcing air down
    into the lungs by buccal pumping. \n\nThis is distinct from most higher vertebrates,
    who use a breathing system driven by negative pressure where the lungs are inflated
    by expanding the rib cage. \n\nIn buccal pumping, the floor of the mouth is lowered,
    filling the mouth cavity with air. \n\nThe throat muscles then presses the throat
    against the underside of the skull, forcing the air into the lungs.Due to the
    possibility of respiration across the skin combined with small size, all known
    lungless tetrapods are amphibians. \n\nThe majority of salamander species are
    lungless salamanders, which respirate through their skin and tissues lining their
    mouth. \n\nThis necessarily restricts their size: all are small and rather thread-like
    in appearance, maximising skin surface relative to body volume. \n\nOther known
    lungless tetrapods are the Bornean flat-headed frog and Atretochoana eiselti,
    a caecilian.The lungs of amphibians typically have a few narrow internal walls
    (septa) of soft tissue around the outer walls, increasing the respiratory surface
    area and giving the lung a honeycomb appearance. \n\nIn some salamanders even
    these are lacking, and the lung has a smooth wall. \n\nIn caecilians, as in snakes,
    only the right lung attains any size or development.\n\n\n=== Lungfish ===\n\nThe
    lungs of lungfish are similar to those of amphibians, with few, if any, internal
    septa. \n\nIn the Australian lungfish, there is only a single lung, albeit divided
    into two lobes. \n\nOther lungfish and Polypterus, however, have two lungs, which
    are located in the upper part of the body, with the connecting duct curving around
    and above the esophagus. \n\nThe blood supply also twists around the esophagus,
    suggesting that the lungs originally evolved in the ventral part of the body,
    as in other vertebrates.\n\n\n=== Invertebrates ===\n\n\nSome invertebrates have
    lung-like structures that serve a similar respiratory purpose as, but are not
    evolutionarily related to, vertebrate lungs. \n\nSome arachnids, such as spiders
    and scorpions, have structures called book lungs used for atmospheric gas exchange.
    \n\nSome species of spider have four pairs of book lungs but most have two pairs.
    \n\nScorpions have spiracles on their body for the entrance of air to the book
    lungs.The coconut crab is terrestrial and uses structures called branchiostegal
    lungs to breathe air. \n\nThey cannot swim and would drown in water, yet they
    possess a rudimentary set of gills. \n\nThey can breathe on land and hold their
    breath underwater. \n\nThe branchiostegal lungs are seen as a developmental adaptive
    stage from water-living to enable land-living, or from fish to amphibian.Pulmonates
    are mostly land snails and slugs that have developed a simple lung from the mantle
    cavity. \n\nAn externally located opening called the pneumostome allows air to
    be taken into the mantle cavity lung.\n\n\n== Evolutionary origins ==\n\nThe
    lungs of today's terrestrial vertebrates and the gas bladders of today's fish
    are believed to have evolved from simple sacs, as outpocketings of the esophagus,
    that allowed early fish to gulp air under oxygen-poor conditions. \n\nThese outpocketings
    first arose in the bony fish. \n\nIn most of the ray-finned fish the sacs evolved
    into closed off gas bladders, while a number of carp, trout, herring, catfish,
    and eels have retained the physostome condition with the sac being open to the
    esophagus. \n\nIn more basal bony fish, such as the gar, bichir, bowfin and the
    lobe-finned fish, the bladders have evolved to primarily function as lungs. \n\nThe
    lobe-finned fish gave rise to the land-based tetrapods. \n\nThus, the lungs of
    vertebrates are homologous to the gas bladders of fish (but not to their gills).\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"

  descriptionText: "\n\nSUBLINGUAL GLAND\n\n\nThe paired sublingual glands are major
    salivary glands in the mouth. \n\nThey are the smallest, most diffuse, and the
    only unencapsulated major salivary glands. \n\nThey provide only 3-5% of the
    total salivary volume. \n\nThere are also two other types of salivary glands;
    they are submandibular and parotid glands.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThey lie anterior
    and superior to the submandibular gland and inferior and lateral to the tongue,
    as well as beneath the mucous membrane of the floor of the mouth. \n\nThey are
    bounded laterally by the bone of the mandible and inferolaterally by the mylohyoid
    muscle. \n\nThe glands can be felt behind each mandibular canine. \n\nPlacing
    one index finger within the mouth and the fingertips of the opposite hand outside
    it, the compressed gland is manually palpated between the inner and outer fingers.\nThe
    sublingual glands are drained by 8-20 excretory ducts called the ducts of Rivinus.
    \n\nThe largest of all, the sublingual duct (of Bartholin) joins the submandibular
    duct to drain through the sublingual caruncle. \n\nThe sublingual caruncle is
    a small papilla near the midline of the floor of the mouth on each side of the
    lingual frenum. \n\nMost of the remaining small sublingual ducts (of Rivinus)
    open separate into the mouth on an elevated crest of mucous membrane, the plica
    sublingualis (aka sublingual fold), formed by the gland and located on either
    side of the frenulum linguae. \n\n\n=== Microanatomy ===\n\nThe sublingual gland
    consists mostly of mucous acini capped with serous demilunes and is therefore
    categorized as a mixed mucous gland with a mucous product predominating. \n\nStriated
    and intercalated ducts are also present.\n\n\n=== Blood supply ===\n\nThe gland
    receives its blood supply from the sublingual and submental arteries. \n\nLymph
    from the sublingual salivary gland drains into the submandibular lymph nodes.\n\n\n===
    Nerve supply ===\n\nThe chorda tympani nerve (from the facial nerve via the submandibular
    ganglion) is secretomotor and provides parasympathetic supply to the sublingual
    glands. \n\nThe path of the nerve is as follows: junction between pons and medulla,
    through internal acoustic meatus and facial canal to chorda tympani, through
    middle ear cavity, out petrotympanic fissure to join the lingual nerve, travels
    with lingual nerve to synapse at the submandibular ganglion, then postganglionic
    fibers travels to the sublingual gland.\n\n\n=== Development ===\n\nThe sublingual
    salivary glands appear in the eighth week of prenatal development, two weeks
    later than the other two major salivary glands. \n\nThey develop from epithelial
    buds in the sulcus surrounding the sublingual folds on the floor of the mouth,
    lateral to the developing submandibular gland. \n\nThese buds branch and form
    into cords that canalize to form the sublingual ducts associated with the gland.
    \n\nThe rounded terminal ends of the cords form acini.\n\n\n== Clinical significance
    ==\n\n\nRanulas are the most common pathologic lesion associated with the sublingual
    glands.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sublingual_gland"

  descriptionText: "\n\nBRONCHUS\n\n\nA bronchus is a passage or airway in the lower
    respiratory tract that conducts air into the lungs. \n\nThe first or primary
    bronchi to branch from the trachea at the carina are the right main bronchus
    and the left main bronchus. \n\nThese are the widest bronchi, and enter the right
    lung, and the left lung at each hilum. \n\nThe main bronchi branch into narrower
    secondary bronchi or lobar bronchi, and these branch into narrower tertiary bronchi
    or segmental bronchi. \n\nFurther divisions of the segmental bronchi are known
    as 4th order, 5th order, and 6th order segmental bronchi, or grouped together
    as subsegmental bronchi.\n\nThe bronchi when too narrow to be supported by cartilage
    are known as bronchioles. \n\nNo gas exchange takes place in the bronchi.\n\n\n==
    Structure ==\n\nThe trachea (windpipe) divides at the carina into two main or
    primary bronchi, the left bronchus and the right bronchus. \n\nThe carina of
    the trachea is located at the level of the sternal angle and the fifth thoracic
    vertebra (at rest).\n\nThe right main bronchus is wider, shorter, and more vertical
    than the left main bronchus, its mean length is 1.09 cm. \n\nIt enters the root
    of the right lung at approximately the fifth thoracic vertebra. \n\nThe right
    main bronchus subdivides into three secondary bronchi (also known as lobar bronchi),
    which deliver oxygen to the three lobes of the right lung\u2014the superior,
    middle and inferior lobe. \n\nThe azygos vein arches over it from behind; and
    the right pulmonary artery lies at first below and then in front of it. \n\nAbout
    2 cm from its commencement it gives off a branch to the superior lobe of the
    right lung, which is also called the eparterial bronchus. \n\nEparterial refers
    to its position above the right pulmonary artery. \n\nThe right bronchus now
    passes below the artery, and is known as the hyparterial branch which divides
    into the two lobar bronchi to the middle and lower lobes.\n\nThe left main bronchus
    is smaller in caliber but longer than the right, being 5 cm long. \n\nIt enters
    the root of the left lung opposite the sixth thoracic vertebra. \n\nIt passes
    beneath the aortic arch, crosses in front of the esophagus, the thoracic duct,
    and the descending aorta, and has the left pulmonary artery lying at first above,
    and then in front of it. \n\nThe left bronchus has no eparterial branch, and
    therefore it has been supposed by some that there is no upper lobe to the left
    lung, but that the so-called upper lobe corresponds to the middle lobe of the
    right lung. \n\nThe left main bronchus divides into two secondary bronchi or
    lobar bronchi, to deliver air to the two lobes of the left lung\u2014the superior
    and the inferior lobe.\n\nThe secondary bronchi divide further into tertiary
    bronchi, (also known as segmental bronchi), each of which supplies a bronchopulmonary
    segment. \n\nA bronchopulmonary segment is a division of a lung separated from
    the rest of the lung by a septum of connective tissue. \n\nThis property allows
    a bronchopulmonary segment to be surgically removed without affecting other segments.
    \n\nInitially, there are ten segments in each lung, but during development with
    the left lung having just two lobes, two pairs of segments fuse to give eight,
    four for each lobe. \n\nThe tertiary bronchi divide further in another three
    branchings known as 4th order, 5th order and 6th order segmental bronchi which
    are also referred to as subsegmental bronchi. \n\nThese branch into many smaller
    bronchioles which divide into terminal bronchioles, each of which then gives
    rise to several respiratory bronchioles, which go on to divide into two to eleven
    alveolar ducts. \n\nThere are five or six alveolar sacs associated with each
    alveolar duct. \n\nThe alveolus is the basic anatomical unit of gas exchange
    in the lung.\nThe main bronchi have relatively large lumens that are lined by
    respiratory epithelium. \n\nThis cellular lining has cilia departing towards
    the mouth which removes dust and other small particles. \n\nThere is a smooth
    muscle layer below the epithelium arranged as two ribbons of muscle that spiral
    in opposite directions. \n\nThis smooth muscle layer contains seromucous glands,
    which secrete mucus, in its wall. \n\nHyaline cartilage is present in the bronchi,
    surrounding the smooth muscle layer. \n\nIn the main bronchi, the cartilage forms
    C-shaped rings like those in the trachea, while in the smaller bronchi, hyaline
    cartilage is present in irregularly arranged crescent-shaped plates and islands.
    \n\nThese plates give structural support to the bronchi and keep the airway open.The
    bronchial wall normally has a thickness of 10% to 20% of the total bronchial
    diameter.\n\n\n=== Microanatomy ===\n\n\nThe cartilage and mucous membrane of
    the main bronchus (primary bronchi) are similar to those in the trachea. \n\nThey
    are lined with respiratory epithelium, which is classified as ciliated pseudostratified
    columnar epithelium. \n\nThe epithelium in the main bronchi contains goblet cells,
    which are glandular, modified simple columnar epithelial cells that produce mucins,
    the main component of mucus. \n\nMucus plays an important role in keeping the
    airways clear in the mucociliary clearance process. \n\nAs branching continues
    through the bronchial tree, the amount of hyaline cartilage in the walls decreases
    until it is absent in the bronchioles. \n\nAs the cartilage decreases, the amount
    of smooth muscle increases. \n\nThe mucous membrane also undergoes a transition
    from ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium, to simple cuboidal epithelium,
    to simple squamous epithelium in the alveolar ducts and alveoli.\n\n\n=== Variation
    ===\n\nIn 0.1 to 5% of people there is a right superior lobe bronchus arising
    from the main stem bronchus prior to the carina. \n\nThis is known as a tracheal
    bronchus, and seen as an anatomical variation. \n\nIt can have multiple variations
    and, although usually asymptomatic, it can be the root cause of pulmonary disease
    such as a recurrent infection. \n\nIn such cases resection is often curative.\n\nThe
    cardiac bronchus has a prevalence of \u22480.3% and presents as an accessory
    bronchus arising from the bronchus intermedius between the upper lobar bronchus
    and the origin of the middle and lower lobar bronchi of the right main bronchus.\n\nAn
    accessory cardiac bronchus is usually an asymptomatic condition but may be associated
    with persistent infection or hemoptysis. \n\nIn about half of observed cases
    the cardiac bronchus presents as a short dead-ending bronchial stump, in the
    remainder the bronchus may exhibit branching and associated aerated lung parenchyma.\n\n\n==
    Function ==\n\n\nThe bronchi function to carry air that is breathed in through
    to the functional tissues of the lungs, called alveoli. \n\nExchange of gases
    between the air in the lungs and the blood in the capillaries occurs across the
    walls of the alveolar ducts and alveoli. \n\nThe alveolar ducts and alveoli consist
    primarily of simple squamous epithelium, which permits rapid diffusion of oxygen
    and carbon dioxide.\n\n\n== Clinical significance ==\n\n\nBronchial wall thickening,
    as can be seen on CT scan, generally (but not always) implies inflammation of
    the bronchi (bronchitis). \n\nNormally, the ratio of the bronchial wall thickness
    and the bronchial diameter is between 0.17 and 0.23.\n\n\n=== Bronchitis ===\n\n\nBronchitis
    is defined as inflammation of the bronchi, which can either be acute or chronic.
    \n\nAcute bronchitis is usually caused by viral or bacterial infections. \n\nMany
    sufferers of chronic bronchitis also suffer from chronic obstructive pulmonary
    disease (COPD), and this is usually associated with smoking or long-term exposure
    to irritants.\n\n\n=== Aspiration ===\n\nThe left main bronchus departs from
    the trachea at a greater angle than that of the right main bronchus. \n\nThe
    right bronchus is also wider than the left and these differences predispose the
    right lung to aspirational problems. \n\nIf food, liquids, or foreign bodies
    are aspirated, they will tend to lodge in the right main bronchus. \n\nBacterial
    pneumonia and aspiration pneumonia may result.\n\nIf a tracheal tube used for
    intubation is inserted too far, it will usually lodge in the right bronchus,
    allowing ventilation only of the right lung.\n\n\n=== Asthma ===\n\nAsthma is
    marked by hyperresponsiveness of the bronchi with an inflammatory component,
    often in response to allergens.\n\nIn asthma, the constriction of the bronchi
    can result in difficulty in breathing giving shortness of breath; this can lead
    to a lack of oxygen reaching the body for cellular processes. \n\nIn this case,
    an inhaler can be used to rectify the problem. \n\nThe inhaler administers a
    bronchodilator, which serves to soothe the constricted bronchi and to re-expand
    the airways. \n\nThis effect occurs quite quickly.\n\n\n=== Bronchial atresia
    ===\n\nBronchial atresia is a rare congenital disorder that can have a varied
    appearance. \n\nA bronchial atresia is a defect in the development of the bronchi,
    affecting one or more bronchi \u2013 usually segmental bronchi and sometimes
    lobar. \n\nThe defect takes the form of a blind-ended bronchus. \n\nThe surrounding
    tissue secretes mucus normally but builds up and becomes distended. \n\nThis
    can lead to regional emphysema.\n\nThe collected mucus may form a mucoid impaction
    or a bronchocele, or both. \n\nA pectus excavatum may accompany a bronchial atresia.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchus"

  descriptionText: "\n\nSUPERIOR LOBE OF RIGHT LUNG/\nLUNG\n\n\nThe lungs are the
    primary organs of the respiratory system in humans and most other animals including
    a few fish, and some snails. \n\nIn mammals and most other vertebrates, two lungs
    are located near the backbone on either side of the heart. \n\nTheir function
    in the respiratory system is to extract oxygen from the air and transfer it into
    the bloodstream, and to release carbon dioxide from the bloodstream into the
    atmosphere, in a process of gas exchange. \n\nRespiration is driven by different
    muscular systems in different species. \n\nMammals, reptiles and birds use their
    different muscles to support and foster breathing. \n\nIn earlier tetrapods,
    air was driven into the lungs by the pharyngeal muscles via buccal pumping, a
    mechanism still seen in amphibians. \n\nIn humans, the main muscle of respiration
    that drives breathing is the diaphragm. \n\nThe lungs also provide airflow that
    makes vocal sounds including human speech possible.\nHumans have two lungs, a
    right lung, and a left lung. \n\nThey are situated within the thoracic cavity
    of the chest. \n\nThe right lung is bigger than the left, which shares space
    in the chest with the heart. \n\nThe lungs together weigh approximately 1.3 kilograms
    (2.9 lb), and the right is heavier. \n\nThe lungs are part of the lower respiratory
    tract that begins at the trachea and branches into the bronchi and bronchioles,
    and which receive air breathed in via the conducting zone. \n\nThe conducting
    zone ends at the terminal bronchioles. \n\nThese divide into the respiratory
    bronchioles of the respiratory zone which divide into alveolar ducts that give
    rise to the alveolar sacs that contain the alveoli, where gas exchange takes
    place. \n\nAlveoli are also sparsely present on the walls of the respiratory
    bronchioles and alveolar ducts. \n\nTogether, the lungs contain approximately
    2,400 kilometres (1,500 mi) of airways and 300 to 500 million alveoli. \n\nEach
    lung is enclosed within a pleural sac of two membranes called pleurae; the membranes
    are separated by a film of pleural fluid, which allows the inner and outer membranes
    to slide over each other whilst breathing takes place, without much friction.
    \n\nThe inner pleura also divides each lung into sections called lobes. \n\nThe
    right lung has three lobes and the left has two. \n\nThe lobes are further divided
    into bronchopulmonary segments and pulmonary lobules. \n\nThe lungs have a unique
    blood supply, receiving deoxygenated blood from the heart in the pulmonary circulation
    for the purposes of receiving oxygen and releasing carbon dioxide, and a separate
    supply of oxygenated blood to the tissue of the lungs, in the bronchial circulation.\nThe
    tissue of the lungs can be affected by a number of respiratory diseases, including
    pneumonia and lung cancer. \n\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease includes
    chronic bronchitis and emphysema, and can be related to smoking or exposure to
    harmful substances. \n\nA number of occupational lung diseases can be caused
    by substances such as coal dust, asbestos fibres, and crystalline silica dust.
    \n\nDiseases such as bronchitis can also affect the respiratory tract. \n\nMedical
    terms related to the lung often begin with pulmo-, from the Latin pulmonarius
    (of the lungs) as in pulmonology, or with pneumo- (from Greek \u03C0\u03BD\u03B5\u03CD\u03BC\u03C9\u03BD
    \"lung\") as in pneumonia.\nIn embryonic development, the lungs begin to develop
    as an outpouching of the foregut, a tube which goes on to form the upper part
    of the digestive system. \n\nWhen the lungs are formed the fetus is held in the
    fluid-filled amniotic sac and so they do not function to breathe. \n\nBlood is
    also diverted from the lungs through the ductus arteriosus. \n\nAt birth however,
    air begins to pass through the lungs, and the diversionary duct closes, so that
    the lungs can begin to respire. \n\nThe lungs only fully develop in early childhood.\n\n\n==
    Structure ==\n\n\n\n=== Anatomy ===\n\n\nThe lungs are located in the chest on
    either side of the heart in the rib cage. \n\nThey are conical in shape with
    a narrow rounded apex at the top, and a broad concave base that rests on the
    convex surface of the diaphragm. \n\nThe apex of the lung extends into the root
    of the neck, reaching shortly above the level of the sternal end of the first
    rib. \n\nThe lungs stretch from close to the backbone in the rib cage to the
    front of the chest and downwards from the lower part of the trachea to the diaphragm.
    \n\nThe left lung shares space with the heart, and has an indentation in its
    border called the cardiac notch of the left lung to accommodate this. \n\nThe
    front and outer sides of the lungs face the ribs, which make light indentations
    on their surfaces. \n\nThe medial surfaces of the lungs face towards the centre
    of the chest, and lie against the heart, great vessels, and the carina where
    the trachea divides into the two main bronchi. \n\nThe cardiac impression is
    an indentation formed on the surfaces of the lungs where they rest against the
    heart.\nBoth lungs have a central recession called the hilum at the root of the
    lung, where the blood vessels and airways pass into the lungs. \n\nThere are
    also bronchopulmonary lymph nodes on the hilum.The lungs are surrounded by the
    pulmonary pleurae. \n\nThe pleurae are two serous membranes; the outer parietal
    pleura lines the inner wall of the rib cage and the inner visceral pleura directly
    lines the surface of the lungs. \n\nBetween the pleurae is a potential space
    called the pleural cavity containing a thin layer of lubricating pleural fluid.\n\n\n====
    Lobes ====\nEach lung is divided into sections called lobes by the infoldings
    of the visceral pleura as fissures. \n\nLobes are divided into segments, and
    segments have further divisions as lobules. \n\nThere are three lobes in the
    right lung and two lobes in the left lung. \n\n\n==== Fissures ====\nThe fissures
    are formed in early prenatal development by invaginations of the visceral pleura
    that divide the lobar bronchi, and section the lungs into lobes that helps in
    their expansion. \n\nThe right lung is divided into three lobes by a horizontal
    fissure, and an oblique fissure. \n\nThe left lung is divided into two lobes
    by an oblique fissure which is closely aligned with the oblique fissure in the
    right lung. \n\nIn the right lung the upper horizontal fissure, separates the
    upper (superior) lobe from the middle lobe. \n\nThe lower, oblique fissure separates
    the lower lobe from the middle and upper lobes.Variations in the fissures are
    fairly common being either incompletely formed \nor present as an extra fissure
    as in the azygos fissure, or absent. \n\nIncomplete fissures are responsible
    for interlobar collateral ventilation, airflow between lobes which is unwanted
    in some lung volume reduction procedures.\n\n\n==== Segments ====\nThe main or
    primary bronchi enter the lungs at the hilum and initially branch into secondary
    bronchi also known as lobar bronchi that supply air to each lobe of the lung.
    \n\nThe lobar bronchi branch into tertiary bronchi also known as segmental bronchi
    and these supply air to the further divisions of the lobes known as bronchopulmonary
    segments. \n\nEach bronchopulmonary segment has its own (segmental) bronchus
    and arterial supply. \n\nSegments for the left and right lung are shown in the
    table. \n\nThe segmental anatomy is useful clinically for localising disease
    processes in the lungs. \n\nA segment is a discrete unit that can be surgically
    removed without seriously affecting surrounding tissue.\n\n\n=== Right lung ===\n\nThe
    right lung has both more lobes and segments than the left. \n\nIt is divided
    into three lobes, an upper, middle, and a lower lobe by two fissures, one oblique
    and one horizontal. \n\nThe upper, horizontal fissure, separates the upper from
    the middle lobe. \n\nIt begins in the lower oblique fissure near the posterior
    border of the lung, and, running horizontally forward, cuts the anterior border
    on a level with the sternal end of the fourth costal cartilage; on the mediastinal
    surface it may be traced back to the hilum. \n\nThe lower, oblique fissure, separates
    the lower from the middle and upper lobes and is closely aligned with the oblique
    fissure in the left lung.The mediastinal surface of the right lung is indented
    by a number of nearby structures. \n\nThe heart sits in an impression called
    the cardiac impression. \n\nAbove the hilum of the lung is an arched groove for
    the azygos vein, and above this is a wide groove for the superior vena cava and
    right brachiocephalic vein; behind this, and close to the top of the lung is
    a groove for the brachiocephalic artery. \n\nThere is a groove for the esophagus
    behind the hilum and the pulmonary ligament, and near the lower part of the esophageal
    groove is a deeper groove for the inferior vena cava before it enters the heart.The
    weight of the right lung varies between individuals, with a standard reference
    range in men of 155\u2013720 g (0.342\u20131.587 lb) and in women of 100\u2013590
    g (0.22\u20131.30 lb).\n\n\n=== Left lung ===\n\nThe left lung is divided into
    two lobes, an upper and a lower lobe, by the oblique fissure, which extends from
    the costal to the mediastinal surface of the lung both above and below the hilum.
    \n\nThe left lung, unlike the right, does not have a middle lobe, though it does
    have a homologous feature, a projection of the upper lobe termed the lingula.
    \n\nIts name means \"little tongue\". \n\nThe lingula on the left lung serves
    as an anatomic parallel to the middle lobe on the right lung, with both areas
    being predisposed to similar infections and anatomic complications. \n\nThere
    are two bronchopulmonary segments of the lingula: superior and inferior.The mediastinal
    surface of the left lung has a large cardiac impression where the heart sits.
    \n\nThis is deeper and larger than that on the right lung, at which level the
    heart projects to the left.On the same surface, immediately above the hilum,
    is a well-marked curved groove for the aortic arch, and a groove below it for
    the descending aorta. \n\nThe left subclavian artery, a branch off the aortic
    arch, sits in a groove from the arch to near the apex of the lung. \n\nA shallower
    groove in front of the artery and near the edge of the lung, lodges the left
    brachiocephalic vein. \n\nThe esophagus may sit in a wider shallow impression
    at the base of the lung.The weight of the left lung, by standard reference range,
    in men is 110\u2013675 g (0.243\u20131.488 lb) in women 105\u2013515 g (0.231\u20131.135
    lb).\n\n\n== Microanatomy ==\n\n\nThe lungs are part of the lower respiratory
    tract, and accommodate the bronchial airways when they branch from the trachea.
    \n\nThe bronchial airways terminate in alveoli which make up the functional tissue
    (parenchyma) of the lung, and veins, arteries, nerves, and lymphatic vessels.
    \n\nThe trachea and bronchi have plexuses of lymph capillaries in their mucosa
    and submucosa. \n\nThe smaller bronchi have a single layer of lymph capillaries,
    and they are absent in the alveoli. \n\nThe lungs are supplied with the largest
    lymphatic drainage system of any other organ in the body. \n\nEach lung is surrounded
    by a serous membrane of visceral pleura, which has an underlying layer of loose
    connective tissue attached to the substance of the lung.\n\n\n=== Connective
    tissue ===\n\nThe connective tissue of the lungs is made up of elastic and collagen
    fibres that are interspersed between the capillaries and the alveolar walls.
    \n\nElastin is the key protein of the extracellular matrix and is the main component
    of the elastic fibres. \n\nElastin gives the necessary elasticity and resilience
    required for the persistent stretching involved in breathing, known as lung compliance.
    \n\nIt is also responsible for the elastic recoil needed. \n\nElastin is more
    concentrated in areas of high stress such as the openings of the alveoli, and
    alveolar junctions. \n\nThe connective tissue links all the alveoli to form the
    lung parenchyma which has a sponge-like appearance. \n\nThe alveoli have interconnecting
    air passages in their walls known as the pores of Kohn.\n\n\n=== Respiratory
    epithelium ===\n\n\nAll of the lower respiratory tract including the trachea,
    bronchi, and bronchioles is lined with respiratory epithelium. \n\nThis is a
    ciliated epithelium interspersed with goblet cells which produce mucin the main
    component of mucus, ciliated cells, basal cells, and in the terminal bronchioles\u2013club
    cells with actions similar to basal cells, and macrophages. \n\nThe epithelial
    cells, and the submucosal glands throughout the respiratory tract secrete airway
    surface liquid (ASL), the composition of which is tightly regulated and determines
    how well mucociliary clearance works.Pulmonary neuroendocrine cells are found
    throughout the respiratory epithelium including the alveolar epithelium, though
    they only account for around 0.5 per cent of the total epithelial population.
    \n\nPNECs are innervated airway epithelial cells that are particularly focused
    at airway junction points. \n\nThese cells can produce serotonin, dopamine, and
    norepinephrine, as well as polypeptide products. \n\nCytoplasmic processes from
    the pulmonary neuroendocrine cells extend into the airway lumen where they may
    sense the composition of inspired gas.\n\n\n=== Bronchial airways ===\n\nIn the
    bronchi there are incomplete tracheal rings of cartilage and smaller plates of
    cartilage that keep them open.:\u200A472\u200A Bronchioles are too narrow to
    support cartilage and their walls are of smooth muscle, and this is largely absent
    in the narrower respiratory bronchioles which are mainly just of epithelium.:\u200A472\u200A
    The absence of cartilage in the terminal bronchioles gives them an alternative
    name of membranous bronchioles.\n\n\n=== Respiratory zone ===\n\nThe conducting
    zone of the respiratory tract ends at the terminal bronchioles when they branch
    into the respiratory bronchioles. \n\nThis marks the beginning of the terminal
    respiratory unit called the acinus which includes the respiratory bronchioles,
    the alveolar ducts, alveolar sacs, and alveoli. \n\nAn acinus measures up to
    10 mm in diameter. \n\nA primary pulmonary lobule is that part of the acinus
    that includes the alveolar ducts, sacs, and alveoli but does not include the
    respiratory bronchioles. \n\nThe unit described as the secondary pulmonary lobule
    is the lobule most referred to as the pulmonary lobule or respiratory lobule.:\u200A489\u200A
    This lobule is a discrete unit that is the smallest component of the lung that
    can be seen without aid. \n\nThe secondary pulmonary lobule is likely to be made
    up of between 30 and 50 primary lobules. \n\nThe lobule is supplied by a terminal
    bronchiole that branches into respiratory bronchioles. \n\nThe respiratory bronchioles
    supply the alveoli in each acinus and is accompanied by a pulmonary artery branch.
    \n\nEach lobule is enclosed by an interlobular septa. \n\nEach acinus is incompletely
    separated by an interlobular septa.The respiratory bronchiole gives rise to the
    alveolar ducts that lead to the alveolar sacs, which contain two or more alveoli.
    \n\nThe walls of the alveoli are extremely thin allowing a fast rate of diffusion.
    \n\nThe alveoli have interconnecting small air passages in their walls known
    as the pores of Kohn.\n\n\n=== Alveoli ===\n\n\nAlveoli consist of two types
    of alveolar cell and an alveolar macrophage. \n\nThe two types of cell are known
    as type I and type II cells (also known as pneumocytes). \n\nTypes I and II make
    up the walls and alveolar septa. \n\nType I cells provide 95% of the surface
    area of each alveoli and are flat (\"squamous\"), and Type II cells generally
    cluster in the corners of the alveoli and have a cuboidal shape. \n\nDespite
    this, cells occur in a roughly equal ratio of 1:1 or 6:4.Type I are squamous
    epithelial cells that make up the alveolar wall structure. \n\nThey have extremely
    thin walls that enable an easy gas exchange. \n\nThese type I cells also make
    up the alveolar septa which separate each alveolus. \n\nThe septa consist of
    an epithelial lining and associated basement membranes. \n\nType I cells are
    not able to divide, and consequently rely on differentiation from Type II cells.Type
    II are larger and they line the alveoli and produce and secrete epithelial lining
    fluid, and lung surfactant. \n\nType II cells are able to divide and differentiate
    to Type I cells.The alveolar macrophages have an important role in the immune
    system. \n\nThey remove substances which deposit in the alveoli including loose
    red blood cells that have been forced out from blood vessels.\n\n\n=== Microbiota
    ===\n\n\nThere is a large presence of microorganisms in the lungs known as the
    lung microbiota that interacts with the airway epithelial cells; an interaction
    of probable importance in maintaining homeostasis. \n\nThe microbiota is complex
    and dynamic in healthy people, and altered in diseases such as asthma and COPD.
    \n\nFor example significant changes can take place in COPD following infection
    with rhinovirus. \n\nFungal genera that are commonly found as mycobiota in the
    microbiota include Candida, Malassezia, Saccharomyces, and Aspergillus.\n\n\n===
    Respiratory tract ===\n\n\nThe lower respiratory tract is part of the respiratory
    system, and consists of the trachea and the structures below this including the
    lungs. \n\nThe trachea receives air from the pharynx and travels down to a place
    where it splits (the carina) into a right and left primary bronchus. \n\nThese
    supply air to the right and left lungs, splitting progressively into the secondary
    and tertiary bronchi for the lobes of the lungs, and into smaller and smaller
    bronchioles until they become the respiratory bronchioles. \n\nThese in turn
    supply air through alveolar ducts into the alveoli, where the exchange of gases
    take place. \n\nOxygen breathed in, diffuses through the walls of the alveoli
    into the enveloping capillaries and into the circulation, and carbon dioxide
    diffuses from the blood into the lungs to be breathed out.\nEstimates of the
    total surface area of lungs vary from 50 to 75 square metres (540 to 810 sq ft);
    although this is often quoted in textbooks and the media being \"the size of
    a tennis court\", it is actually less than half the size of a singles court.The
    bronchi in the conducting zone are reinforced with hyaline cartilage in order
    to hold open the airways. \n\nThe bronchioles have no cartilage and are surrounded
    instead by smooth muscle. \n\nAir is warmed to 37 \xB0C (99 \xB0F), humidified
    and cleansed by the conducting zone. \n\nParticles from the air being removed
    by the cilia on the respiratory epithelium lining the passageways, in a process
    called mucociliary clearance.\nPulmonary stretch receptors in the smooth muscle
    of the airways initiate a reflex known as the Hering\u2013Breuer reflex that
    prevents the lungs from over-inflation, during forceful inspiration.\n\n\n===
    Blood supply ===\n\n\nThe lungs have a dual blood supply provided by a bronchial
    and a pulmonary circulation. \n\nThe bronchial circulation supplies oxygenated
    blood to the airways of the lungs, through the bronchial arteries that leave
    the aorta. \n\nThere are usually three arteries, two to the left lung and one
    to the right, and they branch alongside the bronchi and bronchioles. \n\nThe
    pulmonary circulation carries deoxygenated blood from the heart to the lungs
    and returns the oxygenated blood to the heart to supply the rest of the body.The
    blood volume of the lungs is about 450 millilitres on average, about 9% of the
    total blood volume of the entire circulatory system. \n\nThis quantity can easily
    fluctuate from between one-half and twice the normal volume. \n\nAlso, in the
    event of blood loss through hemorrhage, blood from the lungs can partially compensate
    by automatically transferring to the systemic circulation.\n\n\n=== Nerve supply
    ===\n\nThe lungs are supplied by nerves of the autonomic nervous system. \n\nInput
    from the parasympathetic nervous system occurs via the vagus nerve. \n\nWhen
    stimulated by acetylcholine, this causes constriction of the smooth muscle lining
    the bronchus and bronchioles, and increases the secretions from glands. \n\nThe
    lungs also have a sympathetic tone from norepinephrine acting on the beta 2 adrenoceptors
    in the respiratory tract, which causes bronchodilation.The action of breathing
    takes place because of nerve signals sent by the respiratory center in the brainstem,
    along the phrenic nerve from the cervical plexus to the diaphragm.\n\n\n=== Variation
    ===\n\nThe lobes of the lung are subject to anatomical variations. \n\nA horizontal
    interlobar fissure was found to be incomplete in 25% of right lungs, or even
    absent in 11% of all cases. \n\nAn accessory fissure was also found in 14% and
    22% of left and right lungs, respectively. \n\nAn oblique fissure was found to
    be incomplete in 21% to 47% of left lungs. \n\nIn some cases a fissure is absent,
    or extra, resulting in a right lung with only two lobes, or a left lung with
    three lobes.A variation in the airway branching structure has been found specifically
    in the central airway\nbranching. \n\nThis variation is associated with the development
    of COPD in adulthood.\n\n\n== Development ==\n\n\nThe development of the human
    lungs arise from the laryngotracheal groove and develop to maturity over several
    weeks in the foetus and for several years following birth.The larynx, trachea,
    bronchi and lungs that make up the respiratory tract, begin to form during the
    fourth week of embryogenesis from the lung bud which appears ventrally to the
    caudal portion of the foregut.\n\nThe respiratory tract has a branching structure,
    and is also known as the respiratory tree. \n\nIn the embryo this structure is
    developed in the process of branching morphogenesis, and is generated by the
    repeated splitting of the tip of the branch. \n\nIn the development of the lungs
    (as in some other organs) the epithelium forms branching tubes. \n\nThe lung
    has a left-right symmetry and each bud known as a bronchial bud grows out as
    a tubular epithelium that becomes a bronchus. \n\nEach bronchus branches into
    bronchioles. \n\nThe branching is a result of the tip of each tube bifurcating.
    \n\nThe branching process forms the bronchi, bronchioles, and ultimately the
    alveoli. \n\nThe four genes mostly associated with branching morphogenesis in
    the lung are the intercellular signalling protein \u2013 sonic hedgehog (SHH),
    fibroblast growth factors FGF10 and FGFR2b, and bone morphogenetic protein BMP4.
    \n\nFGF10 is seen to have the most prominent role. \n\nFGF10 is a paracrine signalling
    molecule needed for epithelial branching, and SHH inhibits FGF10. \n\nThe development
    of the alveoli is influenced by a different mechanism whereby continued bifurcation
    is stopped and the distal tips become dilated to form the alveoli.\nAt the end
    of the fourth week the lung bud divides into two, the right and left primary
    bronchial buds on each side of the trachea. \n\nDuring the fifth week the right
    bud branches into three secondary bronchial buds and the left branches into two
    secondary bronchial buds. \n\nThese give rise to the lobes of the lungs, three
    on the right and two on the left. \n\nOver the following week, the secondary
    buds branch into tertiary buds, about ten on each side. \n\nFrom the sixth week
    to the sixteenth week, the major elements of the lungs appear except the alveoli.
    \n\nFrom week 16 to week 26, the bronchi enlarge and lung tissue becomes highly
    vascularised. \n\nBronchioles and alveolar ducts also develop. \n\nBy week 26
    the terminal bronchioles have formed which branch into two respiratory bronchioles.
    \n\nDuring the period covering the 26th week until birth the important blood\u2013air
    barrier is established. \n\nSpecialised type I alveolar cells where gas exchange
    will take place, together with the type II alveolar cells that secrete pulmonary
    surfactant, appear. \n\nThe surfactant reduces the surface tension at the air-alveolar
    surface which allows expansion of the alveolar sacs. \n\nThe alveolar sacs contain
    the primitive alveoli that form at the end of the alveolar ducts,\nand their
    appearance around the seventh month marks the point at which limited respiration
    would be possible, and the premature baby could survive.\n\n\n=== Vitamin A deficiency
    ===\n\n\nThe developing lung is particularly vulnerable to changes in the levels
    of vitamin A. \n\nVitamin A deficiency has been linked to changes in the epithelial
    lining of the lung and in the lung parenchyma. \n\nThis can disrupt the normal
    physiology of the lung and predispose to respiratory diseases. \n\nSevere nutritional
    deficiency in vitamin A results in a reduction in the formation of the alveolar
    walls (septa) and to notable changes in the respiratory epithelium; alterations
    are noted in the extracellular matrix and in the protein content of the basement
    membrane. \n\nThe extracellular matrix maintains lung elasticity; the basement
    membrane is associated with alveolar epithelium and is important in the blood-air
    barrier. \n\nThe deficiency is associated with functional defects and disease
    states. \n\nVitamin A is crucial in the development of the alveoli which continues
    for several years after birth.\n\n\n=== After birth ===\n\nAt birth, the baby's
    lungs are filled with fluid secreted by the lungs and are not inflated. \n\nAfter
    birth the infant's central nervous system reacts to the sudden change in temperature
    and environment. \n\nThis triggers the first breath, within about 10 seconds
    after delivery. \n\nBefore birth, the lungs are filled with fetal lung fluid.  
    After the first breath, the fluid is quickly absorbed into the body or exhaled.
    \n\nThe resistance in the lung's blood vessels decreases giving an increased
    surface area for gas exchange, and the lungs begin to breathe spontaneously.
    \n\nThis accompanies other changes which result in an increased amount of blood
    entering the lung tissues.At birth the lungs are very undeveloped with only around
    one sixth of the alveoli of the adult lung present. \n\nThe alveoli continue
    to form into early adulthood, and their ability to form when necessary is seen
    in the regeneration of the lung. \n\nAlveolar septa have a double capillary network
    instead of the single network of the developed lung. \n\nOnly after the maturation
    of the capillary network can the lung enter a normal phase of growth. \n\nFollowing
    the early growth in numbers of alveoli there is another stage of the alveoli
    being enlarged.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\n\n\n=== Gas exchange ===\n\nThe major
    function of the lungs is gas exchange between the lungs and the blood. \n\nThe
    alveolar and pulmonary capillary gases equilibrate across the thin blood\u2013air
    barrier. \n\nThis thin membrane (about 0.5 \u20132 \u03BCm thick) is folded into
    about 300 million alveoli, providing an extremely large surface area (estimates
    varying between 70 and 145 m2) for gas exchange to occur.\n\nThe lungs are not
    capable of expanding to breathe on their own, and will only do so when there
    is an increase in the volume of the thoracic cavity. \n\nThis is achieved by
    the muscles of respiration, through the contraction of the diaphragm, and the
    intercostal muscles which pull the rib cage upwards as shown in the diagram.
    \n\nDuring breathing out the muscles relax, returning the lungs to their resting
    position. \n\nAt this point the lungs contain the functional residual capacity
    (FRC) of air, which, in the adult human, has a volume of about 2.5\u20133.0 litres.During
    heavy breathing as in exertion, a large number of accessory muscles in the neck
    and abdomen are recruited, that during exhalation pull the ribcage down, decreasing
    the volume of the thoracic cavity. \n\nThe FRC is now decreased, but since the
    lungs cannot be emptied completely there is still about a litre of residual air
    left. \n\nLung function testing is carried out to evaluate lung volumes and capacities.\n\n\n===
    Protection ===\n\nThe lungs possess several characteristics which protect against
    infection. \n\nThe respiratory tract is lined by respiratory epithelium or respiratory
    mucosa, with hair-like projections called cilia that beat rhythmically and carry
    mucus. \n\nThis mucociliary clearance is an important defence system against
    air-borne infection. \n\nThe dust particles and bacteria in the inhaled air are
    caught in the mucosal surface of the airways, and are moved up towards the pharynx
    by the rhythmic upward beating action of the cilia.:\u200A661\u2013730\u200A
    The lining of the lung also secretes immunoglobulin A which protects against
    respiratory infections; goblet cells secrete mucus which also contains several
    antimicrobial compounds such as defensins, antiproteases, and antioxidants. \n\nA
    rare type of specialised cell called a pulmonary ionocyte that is suggested may
    regulate mucus viscosity has been described. \n\nIn addition, the lining of the
    lung also contains macrophages, immune cells which engulf and destroy debris
    and microbes that enter the lung in a process known as phagocytosis; and dendritic
    cells which present antigens to activate components of the adaptive immune system
    such as T cells and B cells.The size of the respiratory tract and the flow of
    air also protect the lungs from larger particles. \n\nSmaller particles deposit
    in the mouth and behind the mouth in the oropharynx, and larger particles are
    trapped in nasal hair after inhalation.\n\n\n=== Other ===\n\nIn addition to
    their function in respiration, the lungs have a number of other functions. \n\nThey
    are involved in maintaining homeostasis, helping in the regulation of blood pressure
    as part of the renin\u2013angiotensin system. \n\nThe inner lining of the blood
    vessels secretes angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) an enzyme that catalyses
    the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. \n\nThe lungs are involved
    in the blood's acid\u2013base homeostasis by expelling carbon dioxide when breathing.The
    lungs also serve a protective role. \n\nSeveral blood-borne substances, such
    as a few types of prostaglandins, leukotrienes, serotonin and bradykinin, are
    excreted through the lungs. \n\nDrugs and other substances can be absorbed, modified
    or excreted in the lungs. \n\nThe lungs filter out small blood clots from veins
    and prevent them from entering arteries and causing strokes.The lungs also play
    a pivotal role in speech by providing air and airflow for the creation of vocal
    sounds, and other paralanguage communications such as sighs and gasps.\nResearch
    suggests a role of the lungs in the production of blood platelets.\n\n\n== Gene
    and protein expression ==\n\n\nAbout 20,000 protein coding genes are expressed
    in human cells and almost 75% of these genes are expressed in the normal lung.
    \n\nA little less than 200 of these genes are more specifically expressed in
    the lung with less than 20 genes being highly lung specific. \n\nThe highest
    expression of lung specific proteins are different surfactant proteins, such
    as SFTPA1, SFTPB and SFTPC, and napsin, expressed in type II pneumocytes. \n\nOther
    proteins with elevated expression in the lung are the dynein protein DNAH5 in
    ciliated cells, and the secreted SCGB1A1 protein in mucus-secreting goblet cells
    of the airway mucosa.\n\n\n== Clinical significance ==\n\n\nLungs can be affected
    by a number of diseases and disorders. \n\nPulmonology is the medical speciality
    that deals with respiratory diseases involving the lungs and respiratory system.
    \n\nCardiothoracic surgery deals with surgery of the lungs including lung volume
    reduction surgery, lobectomy, pneumectomy and lung transplantation.\n\n\n===
    Inflammation and infection ===\n\nInflammatory conditions of the lung tissue
    are pneumonia, of the respiratory tract are bronchitis and bronchiolitis, and
    of the pleurae surrounding the lungs pleurisy. \n\nInflammation is usually caused
    by infections due to bacteria or viruses. \n\nWhen the lung tissue is inflamed
    due to other causes it is called pneumonitis. \n\nOne major cause of bacterial
    pneumonia is tuberculosis. \n\nChronic infections often occur in those with immunodeficiency
    and can include a fungal infection by Aspergillus fumigatus that can lead to
    an aspergilloma forming in the lung.Alcohol affects the lungs and can cause inflammatory
    alcoholic lung disease. \n\nAcute exposure to alcohol stimulates the beating
    of cilia in the respiratory epithelium. \n\nHowever, chronic exposure has the
    effect of desensitising the ciliary response which reduces mucociliary clearance
    (MCC). \n\nMCC is an innate defense system protecting against pollutants and
    pathogens, and when this is disrupted the numbers of alveolar macrophages are
    decreased. \n\nA subsequent inflammatory response is the release of cytokines.
    \n\nAnother consequence is the susceptibility to infection.\n\n\n=== Blood-supply
    changes ===\n\n\nA pulmonary embolism is a blood clot that becomes lodged in
    the pulmonary arteries. \n\nThe majority of emboli arise because of deep vein
    thrombosis in the legs. \n\nPulmonary emboli may be investigated using a ventilation/perfusion
    scan, a CT scan of the arteries of the lung, or blood tests such as the D-dimer.
    \n\nPulmonary hypertension describes an increased pressure at the beginning of
    the pulmonary artery that has a large number of differing causes. \n\nOther rarer
    conditions may also affect the blood supply of the lung, such as granulomatosis
    with polyangiitis, which causes inflammation of the small blood vessels of the
    lungs and kidneys.A lung contusion is a bruise caused by chest trauma. \n\nIt
    results in hemorrhage of the alveoli causing a build-up of fluid which can impair
    breathing, and this can be either mild or severe.\nThe function of the lungs
    can also be affected by compression from fluid in the pleural cavity pleural
    effusion, or other substances such as air (pneumothorax), blood (hemothorax),
    or rarer causes. \n\nThese may be investigated using a chest X-ray or CT scan,
    and may require the insertion of a surgical drain until the underlying cause
    is identified and treated.\n\n\n=== Obstructive lung diseases ===\n\n\nAsthma,
    chronic bronchitis, bronchiectasis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
    (COPD) are all obstructive lung diseases characterised by airway obstruction.
    \n\nThis limits the amount of air that is able to enter alveoli because of constriction
    of the bronchial tree, due to inflammation. \n\nObstructive lung diseases are
    often identified because of symptoms and diagnosed with pulmonary function tests
    such as spirometry. \n\nMany obstructive lung diseases are managed by avoiding
    triggers (such as dust mites or smoking), with symptom control such as bronchodilators,
    and with suppression of inflammation (such as through corticosteroids) in severe
    cases. \n\nA common cause of chronic bronchitis, and emphysema, is smoking; and
    common causes of bronchiectasis include severe infections and cystic fibrosis.
    \n\nThe definitive cause of asthma is not yet known.The breakdown of alveolar
    tissue, often as a result of tobacco-smoking leads to emphysema, which can become
    severe enough to develop into COPD. \n\nElastase breaks down the elastin in the
    lung's connective tissue that can also result in emphysema. \n\nElastase is inhibited
    by the acute-phase protein, alpha-1 antitrypsin, and when there is a deficiency
    in this, emphysema can develop. \n\nWith persistent stress from smoking, the
    airway basal cells become disarranged and lose their regenerative ability needed
    to repair the epithelial barrier. \n\nThe disorganised basal cells are seen to
    be responsible for the major airway changes that are characteristic of COPD,
    and with continued stress can undergo a malignant transformation. \n\nStudies
    have shown that the initial development of emphysema is centred on the early
    changes in the airway epithelium of the small airways. \n\nBasal cells become
    further deranged in a smoker's transition to clinically defined COPD.\n\n\n===
    Restrictive lung diseases ===\n\nSome types of chronic lung diseases are classified
    as restrictive lung disease, because of a restriction in the amount of lung tissue
    involved in respiration. \n\nThese include pulmonary fibrosis which can occur
    when the lung is inflamed for a long period of time. \n\nFibrosis in the lung
    replaces functioning lung tissue with fibrous connective tissue. \n\nThis can
    be due to a large variety of occupational lung diseases such as Coalworker's
    pneumoconiosis, autoimmune diseases or more rarely to a reaction to medication.
    \n\nSevere respiratory disorders, where spontaneous breathing is not enough to
    maintain life, may need the use of mechanical ventilation to ensure an adequate
    supply of air.\n\n\n=== Cancers ===\n\nLung cancer can either arise directly
    from lung tissue or as a result of metastasis from another part of the body.
    \n\nThere are two main types of primary tumour described as either small-cell
    or non-small-cell lung carcinomas. \n\nThe major risk factor for cancer is smoking.
    \n\nOnce a cancer is identified it is staged using scans such as a CT scan and
    a sample of tissue from a biopsy is taken. \n\nCancers may be treated surgically
    by removing the tumour, the use of radiotherapy, chemotherapy or a combination,
    or with the aim of symptom control. \n\nLung cancer screening is being recommended
    in the United States for high-risk populations.\n\n\n=== Congenital disorders
    ===\n\nCongenital disorders include cystic fibrosis, pulmonary hypoplasia (an
    incomplete development of the lungs)congenital diaphragmatic hernia, and infant
    respiratory distress syndrome caused by a deficiency in lung surfactant. \n\nAn
    azygos lobe is a congenital anatomical variation which though usually without
    effect can cause problems in thoracoscopic procedures.\n\n\n=== Others ===\n\nA
    pneumothorax (collapsed lung) is an abnormal collection of air in the pleural
    space that causes an uncoupling of the lung from the chest wall. \n\nThe lung
    cannot expand against the air pressure inside the pleural space. \n\nAn easy
    to understand example is a traumatic pneumothorax, where air enters the pleural
    space from outside the body, as occurs with puncture to the chest wall. \n\nSimilarly,
    scuba divers ascending while holding their breath with their lungs fully inflated
    can cause air sacs (alveoli) to burst and leak high pressure air into the pleural
    space.\n\n\n=== Lung examination ===\n\n\nAs part of a physical examination in
    response to respiratory symptoms of shortness of breath, and cough, a lung examination
    may be carried out. \n\nThis exam includes palpation and auscultation. \n\nThe
    areas of the lungs that can be listened to using a stethoscope are called the
    lung fields, and these are the posterior, lateral, and anterior lung fields.
    \n\nThe posterior fields can be listened to from the back and include: the lower
    lobes (taking up three quarters of the posterior fields); the anterior fields
    taking up the other quarter; and the lateral fields under the axillae, the left
    axilla for the lingual, the right axilla for the middle right lobe. \n\nThe anterior
    fields can also be auscultated from the front. \n\nAbnormal breathing sounds
    heard during a lung exam can indicate the presence of a lung condition; wheezing
    for example is commonly associated with asthma and COPD.\n\n\n=== Lung function
    testing ===\n\n\nLung function testing is carried out by evaluating a person's
    capacity to inhale and exhale in different circumstances. \n\nThe volume of air
    inhaled and exhaled by a person at rest is the tidal volume (normally 500-750mL);
    the inspiratory reserve volume and expiratory reserve volume are the additional
    amounts a person is able to forcibly inhale and exhale respectively. \n\nThe
    summed total of forced inspiration and expiration is a person's vital capacity.
    \n\nNot all air is expelled from the lungs even after a forced breath out; the
    remainder of the air is called the residual volume. \n\nTogether these terms
    are referred to as lung volumes.Pulmonary plethysmographs are used to measure
    functional residual capacity. \n\nFunctional residual capacity cannot be measured
    by tests that rely on breathing out, as a person is only able to breathe a maximum
    of 80% of their total functional capacity. \n\nThe total lung capacity depends
    on the person's age, height, weight, and sex, and normally ranges between 4 and
    6 litres. \n\nFemales tend to have a 20\u201325% lower capacity than males. \n\nTall
    people tend to have a larger total lung capacity than shorter people. \n\nSmokers
    have a lower capacity than nonsmokers. \n\nThinner persons tend to have a larger
    capacity. \n\nLung capacity can be increased by physical training as much as
    40% but the effect may be modified by exposure to air pollution.Other lung function
    tests include spirometry, measuring the amount (volume) and flow of air that
    can be inhaled and exhaled. \n\nThe maximum volume of breath that can be exhaled
    is called the vital capacity. \n\nIn particular, how much a person is able to
    exhale in one second (called forced expiratory volume (FEV1)) as a proportion
    of how much they are able to exhale in total (FEV). \n\nThis ratio, the FEV1/FEV
    ratio, is important to distinguish whether a lung disease is restrictive or obstructive.
    \n\nAnother test is that of the lung's diffusing capacity \u2013 this is a measure
    of the transfer of gas from air to the blood in the lung capillaries.\n\n\n==
    Other animals ==\n\n\n\n=== Birds ===\n\n\n \nThe lungs of birds are relatively
    small, but are connected to 8 or 9 air sacs that extend through much of the body,
    and are in turn connected to air spaces within the bones. \n\nOn inhalation,
    air travels through the trachea of a bird into the air sacs. \n\nAir then travels
    continuously from the air sacs at the back, through the lungs, which are relatively
    fixed in size, to the air sacs at the front. \n\nFrom here, the air is exhaled.
    \n\nThese fixed size lungs are called \"circulatory lungs\", as distinct from
    the \"bellows-type lungs\" found in most other animals.The lungs of birds contain
    millions of tiny parallel passages called parabronchi. \n\nSmall sacs called
    atria radiate from the walls of the tiny passages; these, like the alveoli in
    other lungs, are the site of gas exchange by simple diffusion. \n\nThe blood
    flow around the parabronchi and their atria forms a cross-current process of
    gas exchange (see diagram on the right).The air sacs, which hold air, do not
    contribute much to gas exchange, despite being thin-walled, as they are poorly
    vascularised. \n\nThe air sacs expand and contract due to changes in the volume
    in the thorax and abdomen. \n\nThis volume change is caused by the movement of
    the sternum and ribs and this movement is often synchronised with movement of
    the flight muscles.Parabronchi in which the air flow is unidirectional are called
    paleopulmonic parabronchi and are found in all birds. \n\nSome birds, however,
    have, in addition, a lung structure where the air flow in the parabronchi is
    bidirectional. \n\nThese are termed neopulmonic parabronchi.\n\n\n=== Reptiles
    ===\n\n\nThe lungs of most reptiles have a single bronchus running down the centre,
    from which numerous branches reach out to individual pockets throughout the lungs.
    \n\nThese pockets are similar to alveoli in mammals, but much larger and fewer
    in number. \n\nThese give the lung a sponge-like texture. \n\nIn tuataras, snakes,
    and some lizards, the lungs are simpler in structure, similar to that of typical
    amphibians.Snakes and limbless lizards typically possess only the right lung
    as a major respiratory organ; the left lung is greatly reduced, or even absent.
    \n\nAmphisbaenians, however, have the opposite arrangement, with a major left
    lung, and a reduced or absent right lung.Both crocodilians and monitor lizards
    have developed lungs similar to those of birds, providing a unidirectional airflow
    and even possessing air sacs. \n\nThe now extinct pterosaurs have seemingly even
    further refined this type of lung, extending the airsacs into the wing membranes
    and, in the case of lonchodectids, tupuxuara, and azhdarchoids, the hindlimbs.Reptilian
    lungs typically receive air via expansion and contraction of the ribs driven
    by axial muscles and buccal pumping. \n\nCrocodilians also rely on the hepatic
    piston method, in which the liver is pulled back by a muscle anchored to the
    pubic bone (part of the pelvis) called the diaphragmaticus, which in turn creates
    negative pressure in the crocodile's thoracic cavity, allowing air to be moved
    into the lungs by Boyle's law. \n\nTurtles, which are unable to move their ribs,
    instead use their forelimbs and pectoral girdle to force air in and out of the
    lungs.\n\n\n=== Amphibians ===\n\n\nThe lungs of most frogs and other amphibians
    are simple and balloon-like, with gas exchange limited to the outer surface of
    the lung. \n\nThis is not very efficient, but amphibians have low metabolic demands
    and can also quickly dispose of carbon dioxide by diffusion across their skin
    in water, and supplement their oxygen supply by the same method. \n\nAmphibians
    employ a positive pressure system to get air to their lungs, forcing air down
    into the lungs by buccal pumping. \n\nThis is distinct from most higher vertebrates,
    who use a breathing system driven by negative pressure where the lungs are inflated
    by expanding the rib cage. \n\nIn buccal pumping, the floor of the mouth is lowered,
    filling the mouth cavity with air. \n\nThe throat muscles then presses the throat
    against the underside of the skull, forcing the air into the lungs.Due to the
    possibility of respiration across the skin combined with small size, all known
    lungless tetrapods are amphibians. \n\nThe majority of salamander species are
    lungless salamanders, which respirate through their skin and tissues lining their
    mouth. \n\nThis necessarily restricts their size: all are small and rather thread-like
    in appearance, maximising skin surface relative to body volume. \n\nOther known
    lungless tetrapods are the Bornean flat-headed frog and Atretochoana eiselti,
    a caecilian.The lungs of amphibians typically have a few narrow internal walls
    (septa) of soft tissue around the outer walls, increasing the respiratory surface
    area and giving the lung a honeycomb appearance. \n\nIn some salamanders even
    these are lacking, and the lung has a smooth wall. \n\nIn caecilians, as in snakes,
    only the right lung attains any size or development.\n\n\n=== Lungfish ===\n\nThe
    lungs of lungfish are similar to those of amphibians, with few, if any, internal
    septa. \n\nIn the Australian lungfish, there is only a single lung, albeit divided
    into two lobes. \n\nOther lungfish and Polypterus, however, have two lungs, which
    are located in the upper part of the body, with the connecting duct curving around
    and above the esophagus. \n\nThe blood supply also twists around the esophagus,
    suggesting that the lungs originally evolved in the ventral part of the body,
    as in other vertebrates.\n\n\n=== Invertebrates ===\n\n\nSome invertebrates have
    lung-like structures that serve a similar respiratory purpose as, but are not
    evolutionarily related to, vertebrate lungs. \n\nSome arachnids, such as spiders
    and scorpions, have structures called book lungs used for atmospheric gas exchange.
    \n\nSome species of spider have four pairs of book lungs but most have two pairs.
    \n\nScorpions have spiracles on their body for the entrance of air to the book
    lungs.The coconut crab is terrestrial and uses structures called branchiostegal
    lungs to breathe air. \n\nThey cannot swim and would drown in water, yet they
    possess a rudimentary set of gills. \n\nThey can breathe on land and hold their
    breath underwater. \n\nThe branchiostegal lungs are seen as a developmental adaptive
    stage from water-living to enable land-living, or from fish to amphibian.Pulmonates
    are mostly land snails and slugs that have developed a simple lung from the mantle
    cavity. \n\nAn externally located opening called the pneumostome allows air to
    be taken into the mantle cavity lung.\n\n\n== Evolutionary origins ==\n\nThe
    lungs of today's terrestrial vertebrates and the gas bladders of today's fish
    are believed to have evolved from simple sacs, as outpocketings of the esophagus,
    that allowed early fish to gulp air under oxygen-poor conditions. \n\nThese outpocketings
    first arose in the bony fish. \n\nIn most of the ray-finned fish the sacs evolved
    into closed off gas bladders, while a number of carp, trout, herring, catfish,
    and eels have retained the physostome condition with the sac being open to the
    esophagus. \n\nIn more basal bony fish, such as the gar, bichir, bowfin and the
    lobe-finned fish, the bladders have evolved to primarily function as lungs. \n\nThe
    lobe-finned fish gave rise to the land-based tetrapods. \n\nThus, the lungs of
    vertebrates are homologous to the gas bladders of fish (but not to their gills).\n\n\n==

  descriptionText: "\n\nTESTIS/\nTESTICLE\n\n\nTesticle or testis (plural testes)
    is the male reproductive gland or gonad in all animals, including humans. \n\nIt
    is homologous to the female ovary. \n\nThe functions of the testes are to produce
    both sperm and androgens, primarily testosterone. \n\nTestosterone release is
    controlled by the anterior pituitary luteinizing hormone, whereas sperm production
    is controlled both by the anterior pituitary follicle-stimulating hormone and
    gonadal testosterone.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\n=== Appearance ===\n\nMales have
    two testicles of similar size contained within the scrotum, which is an extension
    of the abdominal wall. \n\nScrotal asymmetry is not unusual: one testicle extends
    farther down into the scrotum than the other due to differences in the anatomy
    of the vasculature.\n\n\n=== Measurement ===\n\nThe volume of the testicle can
    be estimated by palpating it and comparing it to ellipsoids of known sizes. \n\nAnother
    method is to use calipers (an orchidometer) or a ruler either on the person or
    on an ultrasound image to obtain the three measurements of the x, y, and z axes
    (length, depth and width). \n\nThese measurements can then be used to calculate
    the volume, using the formula for the volume of an ellipsoid: \n\nAn average
    adult testicle measures up to 5 cm \xD7 2 cm \xD7 3 cm (2 in \xD7 3\u20444 in
    \xD7 1+1\u20444 in). \n\nThe Tanner scale for the maturity of male genitals assigns
    a maturity stage to the calculated volume ranging from stage I, a volume of less
    than 1.5 cm3; to stage V, a volume greater than 20 cm3. \n\nNormal volume is
    15 to 25 cm3; the average is 18 cm3 per testis (range 12\u201330 cm3).\n\n\n===
    Internal structure ===\n\n==== Duct system ====\n\nThe testes are covered by
    a tough membranous shell called the tunica albuginea. \n\nWithin the testes are
    very fine coiled tubes called seminiferous tubules. \n\nThe tubules are lined
    with a layer of cells (germ cells) that develop from puberty through old age
    into sperm cells (also known as spermatozoa or male gametes). \n\nThe developing
    sperm travel through the seminiferous tubules to the rete testis located in the
    mediastinum testis, to the efferent ducts, and then to the epididymis where newly
    created sperm cells mature (see spermatogenesis). \n\nThe sperm move into the
    vas deferens, and are eventually expelled through the urethra and out of the
    urethral orifice through muscular contractions.\n\n\n==== Primary cell types
    ====\n\nWithin the seminiferous tubules, the germ cells develop into spermatogonia,
    spermatocytes, spermatids and spermatozoon through the process of spermatogenesis.
    \n\nThe gametes contain DNA for fertilization of an ovum Sertoli cells \u2013
    the true epithelium of the seminiferous epithelium, critical for the support
    of germ cell development into spermatozoa. \n\nSertoli cells secrete inhibin.
    \n\nPeritubular myoid cells surround the seminiferous tubules.Between tubules
    (interstitial cells), exist Leydig cells \u2013 cells localized between seminiferous
    tubules that produce and secrete testosterone and other androgens important for
    sexual development and puberty, secondary sexual characteristics like facial
    hair, sexual behavior and libido. \n\nThey also support spermatogenesis and erectile
    function. \n\nTestosterone controls testicular volume. \nImmature Leydig cells
    and interstitial macrophages and epithelial cells are also present.\n\n\n====
    Blood supply and lymphatic drainage ====\n\nBlood supply and lymphatic drainage
    of the testes and scrotum are distinct:\n\nThe paired testicular arteries arise
    directly from the abdominal aorta and descend through the inguinal canal, while
    the scrotum and the rest of the external genitalia is supplied by the internal
    pudendal artery (itself a branch of the internal iliac artery).\n\nThe testis
    has collateral blood supply from \n1. the cremasteric artery (a branch of the
    inferior epigastric artery, which is a branch of the external iliac artery),
    \nand \n2. the artery to the ductus deferens (a branch of the inferior vesical
    artery, which is a branch of the internal iliac artery). \n\nTherefore, if the
    testicular artery is ligated, e.g., during a Fowler-Stevens orchiopexy for a
    high undescended testis, the testis will usually survive on these other blood
    supplies.\n\nLymphatic drainage of the testes follows the testicular arteries
    back to the paraaortic lymph nodes, while lymph from the scrotum drains to the
    inguinal lymph nodes.\n\n\n==== Layers ====\n\nMany anatomical features of the
    adult testis reflect its developmental origin in the abdomen. \n\nThe layers
    of tissue enclosing each testicle are derived from the layers of the anterior
    abdominal wall. \n\nNotably, the cremasteric muscle arises from the internal
    oblique muscle.\n\n\n==== The blood\u2013testis barrier ====\n\nLarge molecules
    cannot pass from the blood into the lumen of a seminiferous tubule due to the
    presence of tight junctions between adjacent Sertoli cells. \n\nThe spermatogonia
    are in the basal compartment (deep to the level of the tight junctions) and the
    more mature forms such as primary and secondary spermatocytes and spermatids
    are in the adluminal compartment.\n\nThe function of the blood\u2013testis barrier
    may be to prevent an auto-immune reaction. \n\nMature sperm (and their antigens)
    arise long after immune tolerance is established in infancy. \n\nSince sperm
    are antigenically different from self tissue, a male animal can react immunologically
    to his own sperm. \n\nHe is capable of making antibodies against them.\n\nInjection
    of sperm antigens causes inflammation of the testis (auto-immune orchitis) and
    reduced fertility. \n\nThe blood\u2013testis barrier may reduce the likelihood
    that sperm proteins will induce an immune response, reducing fertility and so
    progeny.\n\n\n=== Temperature regulation ===\n\nSpermatogenesis is enhanced at
    temperatures slightly less than core body temperature. \n\nThe spermatogenesis
    is less efficient at lower and higher temperatures than 33 \xB0C. \n\nBecause
    the testes are located outside the body, the smooth tissue of the scrotum can
    move them closer or further away from the body. \n\nThe temperature of the testes
    is maintained at 35 degrees Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit), i.e. two degrees
    below the body temperature of 37 degrees Celsius (98.6 degrees Fahrenheit). \n\nHigher
    temperatures affect spermatogenesis. \n\nThere are a number of mechanisms to
    maintain the testes at the optimum temperature.\n\nThe cremasteric muscle is
    part of the spermatic cord. \n\nWhen this muscle contracts, the cord is shortened
    and the testicle is moved closer up toward the body, which provides slightly
    more warmth to maintain optimal testicular temperature. \n\nWhen cooling is required,
    the cremasteric muscle relaxes and the testicle is lowered away from the warm
    body and is able to cool. \n\nContraction also occurs in response to stress (the
    testicles rise up toward the body in an effort to protect them in a fight).\n\nThe
    cremaster muscle can reflexively raise each testicle individually if properly
    triggered. \n\nThis phenomenon is known as the cremasteric reflex. \n\nThe testicles
    can also be lifted voluntarily using the pubococcygeus muscle, which partially
    activates related muscles.\n\n\n=== Gene and protein expression ===\n\n\nThe
    human genome includes approximately 20,000 protein coding genes: 80% of these
    genes are expressed in adult testes. \n\nThe testes have the highest fraction
    of tissue type-specific genes compared to other organs and tissues: about 1000
    of them are highly specific for the testes, and about 2,200 show an elevated
    pattern of expression here. \n\nA majority of these genes encode for proteins
    that are expressed in the seminiferous tubules and have functions related to
    spermatogenesis. \n\nSperm cells express proteins that result in the development
    of flagella; these same proteins are expressed in the female in cells lining
    the fallopian tube, and cause the development of cilia. \n\nIn other words, sperm
    cell flagella and Fallopian tube cilia are homologous structures. \n\nThe testis-specific
    proteins that show the highest level of expression are protamines.\n\n\n== Development
    ==\n\nThere are two phases in which the testes grow substantially; namely in
    embryonic and pubertal age.\n\n\n=== Embryonic ===\n\n\nDuring mammalian development,
    the gonads are at first capable of becoming either ovaries or testes. \n\nIn
    humans, starting at about week 4 the gonadal rudiments are present within the
    intermediate mesoderm adjacent to the developing kidneys. \n\nAt about week 6,
    sex cords develop within the forming testes. \n\nThese are made up of early Sertoli
    cells that surround and nurture the germ cells that migrate into the gonads shortly
    before sex determination begins. \n\nIn males, the sex-specific gene SRY that
    is found on the Y-chromosome initiates sex determination by downstream regulation
    of sex-determining factors, (such as GATA4, SOX9 and AMH), which leads to development
    of the male phenotype, including directing development of the early bipotential
    gonad down the male path of development.\n\nTestes follow the \"path of descent\"
    from high in the posterior fetal abdomen to the inguinal ring and beyond to the
    inguinal canal and into the scrotum. \n\nIn most cases (97% full-term, 70% preterm),
    both testes have descended by birth. \n\nIn most other cases, only one testis
    fails to descend (cryptorchidism) and that will probably express itself within
    a year.\n\n\n=== Pubertal ===\n\nThe testes grow in response to the start of
    spermatogenesis. \n\nSize depends on lytic function, sperm production (amount
    of spermatogenesis present in testis), interstitial fluid, and Sertoli cell fluid
    production. \n\nAfter puberty, the volume of the testes can be increased by over
    500% as compared to the pre-pubertal size. \n\nTesticles are fully descended
    before one reaches puberty.\n\n\n== Clinical significance ==\n\n=== Protection
    and injury ===\n\n\nThe testicles are well known to be very sensitive to impact
    and injury. \n\nThe pain involved travels up from each testicle into the abdominal
    cavity, via the spermatic plexus, which is the primary nerve of each testicle.
    \n\nThis will cause pain in the hip and the back. \nThe pain usually goes away
    in a few minutes.\n\nTesticular torsion is a medical emergency.\n\nTesticular
    rupture is a medical emergency caused by blunt force impact, sharp edge, or piercing
    impact to one or both testicles, which can lead to necrosis of the testis in
    as little as 30 minutes.\n\nPenetrating injuries to the scrotum may cause castration,
    or physical separation or destruction of the testes, possibly along with part
    or all of the penis, which results in total sterility if the testicles are not
    reattached quickly.\n\nSome jockstraps are designed to provide support to the
    testicles.\n\n\n=== Diseases and conditions ===\n\n-Testicular cancer and other
    neoplasms \u2013 \n\nTo improve the chances of catching possible cases of testicular
    cancer or other health issues early, regular testicular self-examination is recommended.\n\n-Varicocele,
    swollen vein(s) from the testes, usually affecting the left side, the testis
    usually being normal.\n\n-Hydrocele testis, swelling around testes caused by
    accumulation of clear liquid within a membranous sac, the testis usually being
    normal\n\n-Spermatocele, a retention cyst of a tubule of the rete testis or the
    head of the epididymis distended with barely watery fluid that contains spermatozoa.\n\n-Endocrine
    disorders can also affect the size and function of the testis.\n\n-Certain inherited
    conditions involving mutations in key developmental genes also impair testicular
    descent, resulting in abdominal or inguinal testes which remain nonfunctional
    and may become cancerous. \n\n-Other genetic conditions can result in the loss
    of the Wolffian ducts and allow for the persistence of M\xFCllerian ducts. \n\n-Both
    excess and deficient levels of estrogens can disrupt spermatogenesis and cause
    infertility.\n\n-Bell-clapper deformity is a deformity in which the testicle
    is not attached to the scrotal walls, and can rotate freely on the spermatic
    cord within the tunica vaginalis. \n\nIt is the most common underlying cause
    of testicular torsion.\n\n-Orchitis inflammation of the testicles\n-Epididymitis,
    a painful inflammation of the epididymis or epididymides frequently caused by
    bacterial infection but sometimes of unknown origin.\n-Anorchia, the absence
    of one or both testicles.\n-Cryptorchidism or \"undescended testicles\", when
    the testicle does not descend into the scrotum of the infant boy.\n-Testicular
    enlargement is an unspecific sign of various testicular diseases, and can be
    defined as a testicular size of more than 5 cm (long axis) \xD7 3 cm (short axis).\n-Blue
    balls is a slang term for a temporary fluid congestion in the testicles and prostate
    region caused by prolonged sexual arousal.\n-Testicular prostheses are available
    to mimic the appearance and feel of one or both testicles, when absent as from
    injury or as treatment in association to gender dysphoria. \n\nThere have also
    been some instances of their implantation in dogs.\n\n\n=== Effects of exogenous
    hormones ===\n\nTo some extent, it is possible to change testicular size. \n\nShort
    of direct injury or subjecting them to adverse conditions, e.g., higher temperature
    than they are normally accustomed to, they can be shrunk by competing against
    their intrinsic hormonal function through the use of externally administered
    steroidal hormones. \n\nSteroids taken for muscle enhancement (especially anabolic
    steroids) often have the undesired side effect of testicular shrinkage.\n\nSimilarly,
    stimulation of testicular functions via gonadotropic-like hormones may enlarge
    their size. \n\nTestes may shrink or atrophy during hormone replacement therapy
    or through chemical castration.\n\nIn all cases, the loss in testes volume corresponds
    with a loss of spermatogenesis.\n\n\n== Society and culture ==\n\n\nThe testicles
    of calves, lambs, roosters, turkeys, and other animals are eaten in many parts
    of the world, often under euphemistic culinary names. \n\nTesticles are a by-product
    of the castration of young animals raised for meat, so they were probably a late-spring
    seasonal specialty, though nowadays they are generally frozen and available year-round.\n\nAs
    early as 330 BC, Aristotle prescribed the ligation (tying off) of the left testicle
    in men wishing to have boys. \n\nIn the Middle Ages, men who wanted a boy sometimes
    had their left testicle removed. \n\nThis was because people believed that the
    right testicle made \"boy\" sperm and the left made \"girl\" sperm.\n\n\n== Etymology
    and slang ==\n\nOne theory about the etymology of the word testis is based on
    Roman law. \n\nThe original Latin word testis, \"witness\", was used in the firmly
    established legal principle \"Testis unus, testis nullus\" (one witness [equals]
    no witness), meaning that testimony by any one person in court was to be disregarded
    unless corroborated by the testimony of at least another. \n\nThis led to the
    common practice of producing two witnesses, bribed to testify the same way in
    cases of lawsuits with ulterior motives. \n\nSince such \"witnesses\" always
    came in pairs, the meaning was accordingly extended, often in the diminutive
    (testiculus, testiculi).\n\nAnother theory says that testis is influenced by
    a loan translation, from Greek parastat\u0113s \"defender (in law), supporter\"
    that is \"two glands side by side\".In slang, the testes are usually referred
    to as \"balls\" as a reference to blue balls. \n\nFrequently, \"nuts\" (sometimes
    intentionally misspelled as \"nutz\") are also a slang term for the testes due
    to the geometric resemblance, as evidenced by the various usages of the term
    \"Deez Nuts\", which include a satirical political candidate in 2016.\n\n\n==
    Other animals ==\n\n=== External appearance ===\n\nIn sharks, the testicle on
    the right side is usually larger, and in many bird and mammal species, the left
    may be the larger. \n\nThe primitive jawless fish have only a single testis,
    located in the midline of the body, although even this forms from the fusion
    of paired structures in the embryo.\n\nIn seasonal breeders, the weight of the
    testes often increases during the breeding season. \n\nThe testicles of a dromedary
    camel are 7\u201310 cm (2.8\u20133.9 in) long, 4.5 cm (1.8 in) deep and 5 cm
    (2.0 in) in width. \n\nThe right testicle is often smaller than the left.\n\n\n===
    Location ===\n\n==== Internal ====\n\nThe basal condition for mammals is to have
    internal testes. \n\nThe testes of monotremes, xenarthrans, and elephants remain
    within the abdomen. \n\nThere are also some marsupials with external testes and
    Boreoeutherian mammals with internal testes, such as the rhinoceros. \n\nCetaceans
    such as whales and dolphins also have internal testes. \n\nAs external testes
    would increase drag in the water they have internal testes which are kept cool
    by special circulatory systems that cool the arterial blood going to the testes
    by placing the arteries near veins bringing cooled venous blood from the skin.
    \n\nIn odobenids and phocids, the location of the testes is para-abdominal, though
    otariids have scrotal testes.\n\n\n==== External ====\n\nBoreoeutherian land
    mammals, the large group of mammals that includes humans, have externalized testes.
    \n\nTheir testes function best at temperatures lower than their core body temperature.
    \n\nTheir testes are located outside of the body, suspended by the spermatic
    cord within the scrotum.\n\nThere are several hypotheses why most boreotherian
    mammals have external testes which operate best at a temperature that is slightly
    less than the core body temperature, e.g. that it is stuck with enzymes evolved
    in a colder temperature due to external testes evolving for different reasons,
    that the lower temperature of the testes simply is more efficient for sperm production.\n\n   
    1) More efficient. \n\nThe classic hypothesis is that cooler temperature of the
    testes allows for more efficient fertile spermatogenesis. \n\nIn other words,
    there are no possible enzymes operating at normal core body temperature that
    are as efficient as the ones evolved, at least none appearing in our evolution
    so far.\n\nThe early mammals had lower body temperatures and thus their testes
    worked efficiently within their body. \n\nHowever it is argued that boreotherian
    mammals have higher body temperatures than the other mammals and had to develop
    external testes to keep them cool. \n\nIt is argued that those mammals with internal
    testes, such as the monotremes, armadillos, sloths, elephants, and rhinoceroses,
    have a lower core body temperatures than those mammals with external testes.\n\nHowever,
    the question remains why birds despite having very high core body temperatures
    have internal testes and did not evolve external testes. \n\nIt was once theorized
    that birds used their air sacs to cool the testes internally, but later studies
    revealed that birds' testes are able to function at core body temperature.\n\nSome
    mammals which have seasonal breeding cycles keep their testes internal until
    the breeding season at which point their testes descend and increase in size
    and become external.\n\n    2) Irreversible adaptation to sperm competition.
    \n\nIt has been suggested that the ancestor of the boreoeutherian mammals was
    a small mammal that required very large testes (perhaps rather like those of
    a hamster) for sperm competition and thus had to place its testes outside the
    body. \n\nThis led to enzymes involved in spermatogenesis, spermatogenic DNA
    polymerase beta and recombinase activities evolving a unique temperature optimum,
    slightly less than core body temperature. \n\nWhen the boreoeutherian mammals
    then diversified into forms that were larger and/or did not require intense sperm
    competition they still produced enzymes that operated best at cooler temperatures
    and had to keep their testes outside the body. \n\nThis position is made less
    parsimonious by the fact that the kangaroo, a non-boreoeutherian mammal, has
    external testicles. \n\nThe ancestors of kangaroos might, separately from boreotherian
    mammals, have also been subject to heavy sperm competition and thus developed
    external testes, however, kangaroo external testes are suggestive of a possible
    adaptive function for external testes in large animals.\n\n    3) Protection
    from abdominal cavity pressure changes. \n\nOne argument for the evolution of
    external testes is that it protects the testes from abdominal cavity pressure
    changes caused by jumping and galloping.\n\n    4) Protection against DNA damage.
    \n\nMild, transient scrotal heat stress causes DNA damage, reduced fertility
    and abnormal embryonic development in mice. \n\nDNA strand breaks were found
    in spermatocytes recovered from testicles subjected to 40 \xB0C or 42 \xB0C for
    30 minutes. \n\nThese findings suggest that the external location of the testicles
    provides the adaptive benefit of protecting spermatogenic cells from heat-induced
    DNA damage that could otherwise lead to infertility and germline mutation.\n\n\n===
    Size ===\n\nThe relative size of testes is often influenced by mating systems.
    \n\nTesticular size as a proportion of body weight varies widely. \n\nIn the
    mammalian kingdom, there is a tendency for testicular size to correspond with
    multiple mates (e.g., harems, polygamy). \n\nProduction of testicular output
    sperm and spermatic fluid is also larger in polygamous animals, possibly a spermatogenic
    competition for survival. \n\nThe testes of the right whale are likely to be
    the largest of any animal, each weighing around 500 kg (1,100 lb).\n\nAmong the
    Hominidae, gorillas have little female promiscuity and sperm competition and
    the testes are small compared to body weight (0.03%). \n\nChimpanzees have high
    promiscuity and large testes compared to body weight (0.3%). \n\nHuman testicular
    size falls between these extremes (0.08%).Testis weight also varies in seasonal
    breeders like red foxes, golden jackals and coyotes.\n\n\n=== Internal structure
    ===\n\nUnder a tough membranous shell called the tunica albuginea, the testis
    of amniotes, as well as some teleost fish, contains very fine coiled tubes called
    seminiferous tubules.\n\nAmphibians and most fish do not possess seminiferous
    tubules. \n\nInstead, the sperm are produced in spherical structures called sperm
    ampullae. \n\nThese are seasonal structures, releasing their contents during
    the breeding season, and then being reabsorbed by the body. \n\nBefore the next
    breeding season, new sperm ampullae begin to form and ripen. \n\nThe ampullae
    are otherwise essentially identical to the seminiferous tubules in higher vertebrates,
    including the same range of cell types.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testicle"

  descriptionText: "\n\nASCENDING COLON/\nLARGE INTESTINE\n\n\nThe large intestine,
    also known as the large bowel, is the last part of the gastrointestinal tract
    and of the digestive system in vertebrates. \n\nWater is absorbed here and the
    remaining waste material is stored as feces before being removed by defecation.\n\nThe
    colon is the largest portion of the large intestine, so many mentions of the
    large intestine and colon overlap in meaning whenever precision is not the focus.
    \n\nMost sources define the large intestine as the combination of the cecum,
    colon, rectum, and anal canal. \n\nSome other sources exclude the anal canal.\n\nIn
    humans, the large intestine begins in the right iliac region of the pelvis, just
    at or below the waist, where it is joined to the end of the small intestine at
    the cecum, via the ileocecal valve. \n\nIt then continues as the colon ascending
    the abdomen, across the width of the abdominal cavity as the transverse colon,
    and then descending to the rectum and its endpoint at the anal canal. \n\nOverall,
    in humans, the large intestine is about 1.5 metres (5 ft) long, which is about
    one-fifth of the whole length of the gastrointestinal tract.\n\n\n== Structure
    ==\n\nThe colon is the last part of the digestive system. \n\nIt has a segmented
    appearance due to a series of saccules called haustra. \n\nIt extracts water
    and salt from solid wastes before they are eliminated from the body and is the
    site in which flora-aided (largely bacterial) fermentation of unabsorbed material
    occurs. \n\nUnlike the small intestine, the colon does not play a major role
    in absorption of foods and nutrients. \n\nAbout 1.5 litres or 45 ounces of water
    arrives in the colon each day.The length of the average adult human colon is
    65 inches or 166 cm (range of 80 to 313 cm) for males, and 61 inches or 155 cm
    (range of 80 to 214 cm) for females.\n\n\n=== Sections ===\n\n\nIn mammals, the
    colon consists of six sections: the cecum, the ascending colon, the transverse
    colon, the descending colon, the sigmoid colon, and the rectum.Sections of the
    colon are:\n\nThe cecum including the appendix\nThe ascending colon\nThe transverse
    colon including the colic flexures and transverse mesocolon\nThe descending colon\nThe
    sigmoid colon \u2013 the s-shaped region of the large intestine\nThe rectumThe
    parts of the colon are either intraperitoneal or behind it in the retroperitoneum.
    \n\nRetroperitoneal organs, in general, do not have a complete covering of peritoneum,
    so they are fixed in location. \n\nIntraperitoneal organs are completely surrounded
    by peritoneum and are therefore mobile. \n\nOf the colon, the ascending colon,
    descending colon and rectum are retroperitoneal, while the cecum, appendix, transverse
    colon and sigmoid colon are intraperitoneal. \n\nThis is important as it affects
    which organs can be easily accessed during surgery, such as a laparotomy.\n\nIn
    terms of diameter, the cecum is the widest, averaging slightly less than 9 cm
    in healthy individuals, and the transverse colon averages less than 6 cm in diameter.
    \n\nThe descending and sigmoid colon are slightly smaller, with the sigmoid colon
    averaging 4\u20135 cm (1.6\u20132.0 in) in diameter. \n\nDiameters larger than
    certain thresholds for each colonic section can be diagnostic for megacolon.\n\n\n====
    Cecum and appendix ====\n\nThe cecum is the first section of the colon and involved
    in the digestion, while the appendix which develops embryologically from it,
    is a structure of the colon, not involved in digestion and considered to be part
    of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue. \n\nThe function of the appendix is uncertain,
    but some sources believe that the appendix has a role in housing a sample of
    the colon's microflora, and is able to help to repopulate the colon with bacteria
    if the microflora has been damaged during the course of an immune reaction. \n\nThe
    appendix has also been shown to have a high concentration of lymphatic cells.\n\n\n====
    Ascending colon ====\n\nThe ascending colon is the first of four main sections
    of the large intestine. \n\nIt is connected to the small intestine by a section
    of bowel called the cecum. \n\nThe ascending colon runs upwards through the abdominal
    cavity toward the transverse colon for approximately eight inches (20 cm).\n\nOne
    of the main functions of the colon is to remove the water and other key nutrients
    from waste material and recycle it. \n\nAs the waste material exits the small
    intestine through the ileocecal valve, it will move into the cecum and then to
    the ascending colon where this process of extraction starts. \n\nThe waste material
    is pumped upwards toward the transverse colon by peristalsis. \n\nThe ascending
    colon is sometimes attached to the appendix via Gerlach's valve. \n\nIn ruminants,
    the ascending colon is known as the spiral colon.\nTaking into account all ages
    and sexes, colon cancer occurs here most often (41%).\n\n\n==== Transverse colon
    ====\n\nThe transverse colon is the part of the colon from the hepatic flexure,
    also known as the right colic, (the turn of the colon by the liver) to the splenic
    flexure also known as the left colic, (the turn of the colon by the spleen).
    \n\nThe transverse colon hangs off the stomach, attached to it by a large fold
    of peritoneum called the greater omentum. \n\nOn the posterior side, the transverse
    colon is connected to the posterior abdominal wall by a mesentery known as the
    transverse mesocolon.\n\nThe transverse colon is encased in peritoneum, and is
    therefore mobile (unlike the parts of the colon immediately before and after
    it).\n\nThe proximal two-thirds of the transverse colon is perfused by the middle
    colic artery, a branch of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA), while the latter
    third is supplied by branches of the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA). \n\nThe
    \"watershed\" area between these two blood supplies, which represents the embryologic
    division between the midgut and hindgut, is an area sensitive to ischemia.\n\n\n====
    Descending colon ====\n\nThe descending colon is the part of the colon from the
    splenic flexure to the beginning of the sigmoid colon. \n\nOne function of the
    descending colon in the digestive system is to store feces that will be emptied
    into the rectum. \n\nIt is retroperitoneal in two-thirds of humans. \n\nIn the
    other third, it has a (usually short) mesentery. \n\nThe arterial supply comes
    via the left colic artery. \n\nThe descending colon is also called the distal
    gut, as it is further along the gastrointestinal tract than the proximal gut.
    \n\nGut flora are very dense in this region.\n\n\n==== Sigmoid colon ====\n\nThe
    sigmoid colon is the part of the large intestine after the descending colon and
    before the rectum. \n\nThe name sigmoid means S-shaped (see sigmoid; cf. sigmoid
    sinus). \n\nThe walls of the sigmoid colon are muscular and contract to increase
    the pressure inside the colon, causing the stool to move into the rectum.\n\nThe
    sigmoid colon is supplied with blood from several branches (usually between 2
    and 6) of the sigmoid arteries, a branch of the IMA. \n\nThe IMA terminates as
    the superior rectal artery.\n\nSigmoidoscopy is a common diagnostic technique
    used to examine the sigmoid colon.\n\n\n==== Rectum ====\n\nThe rectum is the
    last section of the large intestine. \n\nIt holds the formed feces awaiting elimination
    via defecation.\nIt is about 12 cm long.\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\n\nThe cecum
    \u2013 the first part of the large intestine\n\nTaeniae coli \u2013 three bands
    of smooth muscle\nHaustra \u2013 bulges caused by contraction of taeniae coli\nEpiploic
    appendages \u2013 small fat accumulations on the visceraThe taenia coli run the
    length of the large intestine. \n\nBecause the taenia coli are shorter than the
    large bowel itself, the colon becomes sacculated, forming the haustra of the
    colon which are the shelf-like intraluminal projections.\n\n\n=== Blood supply
    ===\n\nArterial supply to the colon comes from branches of the superior mesenteric
    artery (SMA) and inferior mesenteric artery (IMA). \n\nFlow between these two
    systems communicates via the marginal artery of the colon that runs parallel
    to the colon for its entire length. \n\nHistorically, a structure variously identified
    as the arc of Riolan or meandering mesenteric artery (of Moskowitz) was thought
    to connect the proximal SMA to the proximal IMA. \n\nThis variably present structure
    would be important if either vessel were occluded. \n\nHowever, at least one
    review of the literature questions the existence of this vessel, with some experts
    calling for the abolition of these terms from future medical literature.\n\nVenous
    drainage usually mirrors colonic arterial supply, with the inferior mesenteric
    vein draining into the splenic vein, and the superior mesenteric vein joining
    the splenic vein to form the hepatic portal vein that then enters the liver.\n\n\n===
    Lymphatic drainage ===\n\nLymphatic drainage from the ascending colon and proximal
    two-thirds of the transverse colon is to the colic lymph nodes and the superior
    mesenteric lymph nodes, which drain into the cisterna chyli. \n\nThe lymph from
    the distal one-third of the transverse colon, the descending colon, the sigmoid
    colon, and the upper rectum drain into the inferior mesenteric and colic lymph
    nodes. \n\nThe lower rectum to the anal canal above the pectinate line drain
    to the internal iliac nodes. \n\nThe anal canal below the pectinate line drains
    into the superficial inguinal nodes. \n\nThe pectinate line only roughly marks
    this transition.\n\n\n=== Nerve supply ===\n\nSympathetic supply : Superior &
    inferior mesenteric ganglia\nParasympathetic supply : Vagus & pelvic nerves\n\n\n===
    Development ===\n\n=== Variation ===\n\nOne variation on the normal anatomy of
    the colon occurs when extra loops form, resulting in a colon that is up to five
    metres longer than normal. \n\nThis condition, referred to as redundant colon,
    typically has no direct major health consequences, though rarely volvulus occurs,
    resulting in obstruction and requiring immediate medical attention. \n\nA significant
    indirect health consequence is that use of a standard adult colonoscope is difficult
    and in some cases impossible when a redundant colon is present, though specialized
    variants on the instrument (including the pediatric variant) are useful in overcoming
    this problem.\n\n\n== Microanatomy ==\n\n=== Colonic crypts ===\n\n\nThe wall
    of the large intestine is lined with simple columnar epithelium with invaginations.
    \n\nThe invaginations are called the intestinal glands or colonic crypts.\n\n\t\t\nThe
    colon crypts are shaped like microscopic thick walled test tubes with a central
    hole down the length of the tube (the crypt lumen). \n\nFour tissue sections
    are shown here, two cut across the long axes of the crypts and two cut parallel
    to the long axes. \n\nIn these images the cells have been stained by immunohistochemistry
    to show a brown-orange color if the cells produce a mitochondrial protein called
    cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (CCOI). \n\nThe nuclei of the cells (located at
    the outer edges of the cells lining the walls of the crypts) are stained blue-gray
    with haematoxylin. \n\nAs seen in panels C and D, crypts are about 75 to about
    110 cells long. \n\nBaker et al. found that the average crypt circumference is
    23 cells. \n\nThus, by the images shown here, there are an average of about 1,725
    to 2,530 cells per colonic crypt. \n\nNooteboom et al. measuring the number of
    cells in a small number of crypts reported a range of 1,500 to 4,900 cells per
    colonic crypt. \n\nCells are produced at the crypt base and migrate upward along
    the crypt axis before being shed into the colonic lumen days later. \n\nThere
    are 5 to 6 stem cells at the bases of the crypts.As estimated from the image
    in panel A, there are about 100 colonic crypts per square millimeter of the colonic
    epithelium. \n\nSince the average length of the human colon is 160.5 cm and the
    average inner circumference of the colon is 6.2 cm, the inner surface epithelial
    area of the human colon has an average area of about 995 cm2, which includes
    9,950,000 (close to 10 million) crypts.\n\nIn the four tissue sections shown
    here, many of the intestinal glands have cells with a mitochondrial DNA mutation
    in the CCOI gene and appear mostly white, with their main color being the blue-gray
    staining of the nuclei. \n\nAs seen in panel B, a portion of the stem cells of
    three crypts appear to have a mutation in CCOI, so that 40% to 50% of the cells
    arising from those stem cells form a white segment in the cross cut area.\n\nOverall,
    the percent of crypts deficient for CCOI is less than 1% before age 40, but then
    increases linearly with age. \n\nColonic crypts deficient for CCOI in women reaches,
    on average, 18% in women and 23% in men by 80\u201384 years of age.Crypts of
    the colon can reproduce by fission, as seen in panel C, where a crypt is fissioning
    to form two crypts, and in panel B where at least one crypt appears to be fissioning.
    \n\nMost crypts deficient in CCOI are in clusters of crypts (clones of crypts)
    with two or more CCOI-deficient crypts adjacent to each other (see panel D).\n\n\n====
    Mucosa ====\n\nAbout 150 of the many thousands of protein coding genes expressed
    in the large intestine, some are specific to the mucous membrane in different
    regions and include CEACAM7.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\n\nThe large intestine absorbs
    water and any remaining absorbable nutrients from the food before sending the
    indigestible matter to the rectum. \n\nThe colon absorbs vitamins that are created
    by the colonic bacteria, such as thiamine, riboflavin, and vitamin K (especially
    important as the daily ingestion of vitamin K is not normally enough to maintain
    adequate blood coagulation). \n\nIt also compacts feces, and stores fecal matter
    in the rectum until it can be discharged via the anus in defecation.\n\nThe large
    intestine also secretes K+ and Cl-. \n\nChloride secretion increases in cystic
    fibrosis.\nRecycling of various nutrients takes place in colon. \n\nExamples
    include fermentation of carbohydrates, short chain fatty acids, and urea cycling.\n\nThe
    appendix contains a small amount of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue which gives
    the appendix an undetermined role in immunity. \n\nHowever, the appendix is known
    to be important in fetal life as it contains endocrine cells that release biogenic
    amines and peptide hormones important for homeostasis during early growth and
    development. \n\nThe appendix can be removed with no apparent damage or consequence
    to the patient.By the time the chyme has reached this tube, most nutrients and
    90% of the water have been absorbed by the body. \n\nAt this point some electrolytes
    like sodium, magnesium, and chloride are left as well as indigestible parts of
    ingested food (e.g., a large part of ingested amylose, starch which has been
    shielded from digestion heretofore, and dietary fiber, which is largely indigestible
    carbohydrate in either soluble or insoluble form). \n\nAs the chyme moves through
    the large intestine, most of the remaining water is removed, while the chyme
    is mixed with mucus and bacteria (known as gut flora), and becomes feces. \n\nThe
    ascending colon receives fecal material as a liquid. \n\nThe muscles of the colon
    then move the watery waste material forward and slowly absorb all the excess
    water, causing the stools to gradually solidify as they move along into the descending
    colon.\n\nThe bacteria break down some of the fiber for their own nourishment
    and create acetate, propionate, and butyrate as waste products, which in turn
    are used by the cell lining of the colon for nourishment. \n\nNo protein is made
    available. \n\nIn humans, perhaps 10% of the undigested carbohydrate thus becomes
    available, though this may vary with diet; in other animals, including other
    apes and primates, who have proportionally larger colons, more is made available,
    thus permitting a higher portion of plant material in the diet. \n\nThe large
    intestine produces no digestive enzymes \u2014 chemical digestion is completed
    in the small intestine before the chyme reaches the large intestine. \n\nThe
    pH in the colon varies between 5.5 and 7 (slightly acidic to neutral).\n\n\n===
    Standing gradient osmosis ===\n\nWater absorption at the colon typically proceeds
    against a transmucosal osmotic pressure gradient. \n\nThe standing gradient osmosis
    is the reabsorption of water against the osmotic gradient in the intestines.
    \n\nCells occupying the intestinal lining pump sodium ions into the intercellular
    space, raising the osmolarity of the intercellular fluid. \n\nThis hypertonic
    fluid creates an osmotic pressure that drives water into the lateral intercellular
    spaces by osmosis via tight junctions and adjacent cells, which then in turn
    moves across the basement membrane and into the capillaries, while more sodium
    ions are pumped again into the intercellular fluid. \n\nAlthough water travels
    down an osmotic gradient in each individual step, overall, water usually travels
    against the osmotic gradient due to the pumping of sodium ions into the intercellular
    fluid. \n\nThis allows the large intestine to absorb water despite the blood
    in capillaries being hypotonic compared to the fluid within the intestinal lumen.\n\n\n===
    Gut flora ===\n\n\nThe large intestine houses over 700 species of bacteria that
    perform a variety of functions, as well as fungi, protozoa, and archaea. \n\nSpecies
    diversity varies by geography and diet. \n\nThe microbes in a human distal gut
    often number in the vicinity of 100 trillion, and can weigh around 200 grams
    (0.44 pounds). \n\nThis mass of mostly symbiotic microbes has recently been called
    the latest human organ to be \"discovered\" or in other words, the \"forgotten
    organ\".\n\nThe large intestine absorbs some of the products formed by the bacteria
    inhabiting this region. \n\nUndigested polysaccharides (fiber) are metabolized
    to short-chain fatty acids by bacteria in the large intestine and absorbed by
    passive diffusion. \n\nThe bicarbonate that the large intestine secretes helps
    to neutralize the increased acidity resulting from the formation of these fatty
    acids.\n\nThese bacteria also produce large amounts of vitamins, especially vitamin
    K and biotin (a B vitamin), for absorption into the blood. \n\nAlthough this
    source of vitamins, in general, provides only a small part of the daily requirement,
    it makes a significant contribution when dietary vitamin intake is low. \n\nAn
    individual who depends on absorption of vitamins formed by bacteria in the large
    intestine may become vitamin-deficient if treated with antibiotics that inhibit
    the vitamin producing species of bacteria as well as the intended disease-causing
    bacteria.Other bacterial products include gas (flatus), which is a mixture of
    nitrogen and carbon dioxide, with small amounts of the gases hydrogen, methane,
    and hydrogen sulfide. \n\nBacterial fermentation of undigested polysaccharides
    produces these. \n\nSome of the fecal odor is due to indoles, metabolized from
    the amino acid tryptophan. \n\nThe normal flora is also essential in the development
    of certain tissues, including the cecum and lymphatics.\n\nThey are also involved
    in the production of cross-reactive antibodies. \n\nThese are antibodies produced
    by the immune system against the normal flora, that are also effective against
    related pathogens, thereby preventing infection or invasion.\n\nThe two most
    prevalent phyla of the colon are firmicutes and bacteroidetes. \n\nThe ratio
    between the two seems to vary widely as reported by the Human Microbiome Project.
    \n\nBacteroides are implicated in the initiation of colitis and colon cancer.
    \n\nBifidobacteria are also abundant, and are often described as 'friendly bacteria'.A
    mucus layer protects the large intestine from attacks from colonic commensal
    bacteria.\n\n\n== Clinical significance ==\n\n=== Disease ===\n\n\nFollowing
    are the most common diseases or disorders of the colon:\n\n\n=== Colonoscopy
    ===\n\n\nColonoscopy is the endoscopic examination of the large intestine and
    the distal part of the small bowel with a CCD camera or a fiber optic camera
    on a flexible tube passed through the anus. \n\nIt can provide a visual diagnosis
    (e.g. ulceration, polyps) and grants the opportunity for biopsy or removal of
    suspected colorectal cancer lesions. \n\nColonoscopy can remove polyps as small
    as one millimetre or less. \n\nOnce polyps are removed, they can be studied with
    the aid of a microscope to determine if they are precancerous or not. \n\nIt
    takes 15 years or less for a polyp to turn cancerous.\nColonoscopy is similar
    to sigmoidoscopy\u2014the difference being related to which parts of the colon
    each can examine. \n\nA colonoscopy allows an examination of the entire colon
    (1200\u20131500 mm in length). \n\nA sigmoidoscopy allows an examination of the
    distal portion (about 600 mm) of the colon, which may be sufficient because benefits
    to cancer survival of colonoscopy have been limited to the detection of lesions
    in the distal portion of the colon.\n\nA sigmoidoscopy is often used as a screening
    procedure for a full colonoscopy, often done in conjunction with a stool-based
    test such as a fecal occult blood test (FOBT), fecal immunochemical test (FIT),
    or multi-target stool DNA test (Cologuard) or blood-based test, SEPT9 DNA methylation
    test (Epi proColon). \n\nAbout 5% of these screened patients are referred to
    colonoscopy.\n\nVirtual colonoscopy, which uses 2D and 3D imagery reconstructed
    from computed tomography (CT) scans or from nuclear magnetic resonance (MR) scans,
    is also possible, as a totally non-invasive medical test, although it is not
    standard and still under investigation regarding its diagnostic abilities. \n\nFurthermore,
    virtual colonoscopy does not allow for therapeutic maneuvers such as polyp/tumour
    removal or biopsy nor visualization of lesions smaller than 5 millimeters. \n\nIf
    a growth or polyp is detected using CT colonography, a standard colonoscopy would
    still need to be performed. \n\nAdditionally, surgeons have lately been using
    the term pouchoscopy to refer to a colonoscopy of the ileo-anal pouch.\n\n\n==
    Other animals ==\n\nThe large intestine is truly distinct only in tetrapods,
    in which it is almost always separated from the small intestine by an ileocaecal
    valve. \n\nIn most vertebrates, however, it is a relatively short structure running
    directly to the anus, although noticeably wider than the small intestine. \n\nAlthough
    the caecum is present in most amniotes, only in mammals does the remainder of
    the large intestine develop into a true colon.\n\nIn some small mammals, the
    colon is straight, as it is in other tetrapods, but, in the majority of mammalian
    species, it is divided into ascending and descending portions; a distinct transverse
    colon is typically present only in primates. \n\nHowever, the taeniae coli and
    accompanying haustra are not found in either carnivorans or ruminants. \n\nThe
    rectum of mammals (other than monotremes) is derived from the cloaca of other
    vertebrates, and is, therefore, not truly homologous with the \"rectum\" found
    in these species.\n\nIn fish, there is no true large intestine, but simply a
    short rectum connecting the end of the digestive part of the gut to the cloaca.
    \n\nIn sharks, this includes a rectal gland that secretes salt to help the animal
    maintain osmotic balance with the seawater. \n\nThe gland somewhat resembles
    a caecum in structure but is not a homologous structure.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_intestine"

  descriptionText: "\n\nEPIDIDYMIS\n\n\nThe epididymis (; plural: epididymides or
    ) is a tube that connects a testicle to a vas deferens in the male reproductive
    system. \n\nIt is present in all male reptiles, birds, and mammals. \n\nIt is
    a single, narrow, tightly-coiled tube in adult humans, 6 to 7 meters (20 to 23
    ft) in length connecting the efferent ducts from the rear of each testicle to
    its vas deferens.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe epididymis can be divided into
    three main regions:\n\nThe head (Latin: caput). \n\nThe head of the epididymis
    receives spermatozoa via the efferent ducts of the mediastinium of the testis.
    \n\nIt is characterized histologically by a thick epithelium with long stereocilia
    (described below) and a little smooth muscle. \n\nIt is involved in absorbing
    fluid to make the sperm more concentrated. \n\nThe concentration of the sperm
    here is dilute.\nThe body (Latin: corpus). \n\nThis has an intermediate epithelium
    and smooth muscle thickness.\nThe tail (Latin: cauda). \n\nThis has the thinnest
    epithelium of the three regions and the greatest quantity of smooth muscle.In
    reptiles, there is an additional canal between the testis and the head of the
    epididymis and which receives the various efferent ducts. \n\nThis is, however,
    absent in all birds and mammals.\n\n\n=== Histology ===\n\nThe epididymis is
    covered by a two layered pseudostratified epithelium. \n\nThe epithelium is separated
    by a basement membrane from the connective tissue wall which has smooth muscle
    cells. \n\nThe major cell types in the epithelium are:\n\nPrincipal cells: columnar
    cells that, with the basal cells, form the majority of the epithelium. \n\nIn
    the caput (head) region these cells have long stereocilia that are tuft-like
    extensions that project into the lumen. \n\nThe sterocilia are much shorter in
    the cauda (tail) segment. \n\nThey also secrete carnitine, sialic acid, glycoproteins,
    and glycerylphosphorylcholine into the lumen.\nBasal cells: shorter, pyramid-shaped
    cells which contact the basal lamina but taper off before their apical surfaces
    reach the lumen. \n\nThese are thought to be undifferentiated precursors of principal
    cells.\nApical cells: predominantly found in the head region\nClear cells: predominant
    in the tail region\nIntraepithelial lymphocytes: distributed throughout the tissue.\nIntraepithelial
    macrophages\n\n\n==== Stereocilia ====\nThe stereocilia of the epididymis are
    long cytoplasmic projections that have an actin filament backbone. \n\nThese
    filaments have been visualized at high resolution using fluorescent phalloidin
    that binds to actin filaments.\nThe stereocilia in the epididymis are non-motile.
    \n\nThese membrane extensions increase the surface area of the cell, allowing
    for greater absorption and secretion. \n\nIt has been shown that epithelial sodium
    channel ENaC that allows the flow of Na+ ions into the cell is localized on stereocilia.Because
    sperm are initially non-motile as they leave the seminiferous tubules, large
    volumes of fluid are secreted to propel them to the epididymis. \n\nThe core
    function of the stereocilia is to resorb 90% of this fluid as the spermatozoa
    start to become motile. \n\nThis absorption creates a fluid current that moves
    the immobile sperm from the seminiferous tubules to the epididymis. \n\nSpermatozoa
    do not reach full motility until they reach the vagina, where the alkaline pH
    is neutralized by acidic vaginal fluids.\n\n\n=== Development ===\n\nIn the embryo,
    the epididymis develops from tissue that once formed the mesonephros, a primitive
    kidney found in many aquatic vertebrates. \n\nPersistence of the cranial end
    of the mesonephric duct will leave behind a remnant called the appendix of the
    epididymis. \n\nIn addition, some mesonephric tubules can persist as the paradidymis,
    a small body caudal to the efferent ductules.\nA Gartner's duct is a homologous
    remnant in the female.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\n\n\n=== Role in storage of sperm
    and ejaculant ===\n\nSpermatozoa formed in the testis enter the caput epididymis,
    progress to the corpus, and finally reach the cauda region, where they are stored.
    \n\nSperm entering the caput epididymis are incomplete\u2014they lack the ability
    to swim forward (motility) and to fertilize an egg. \n\nEpididymal transit takes
    2 to 6 days in humans and 10\u201313 in rodents. \n\nDuring their transit in
    the epididymis, sperm undergo maturation processes necessary for them to acquire
    motility and fertility. \n\nFinal maturation (capacitation) is completed in the
    female reproductive tract.\nThe epididymis secretes immobilin, a large glycoprotein
    that is responsible for the creating of the viscoelastic luminal environment
    that serves to mechanically immobilize spermatozoa until ejaculation. \n\nImmobilin
    is predominantly secreted into the proximal caput epididymis prior to the acquisition
    of the potential for sperm motility. \n\nDuring ejaculation, sperm flow from
    the cauda epididymis (which functions as a storage reservoir) into the vas deferens
    where they are propelled by the peristaltic action of muscle layers in the wall
    of the vas deferens, and are mixed with the diluting fluids of the prostate,
    seminal vesicles, and other accessory glands prior to ejaculation (forming semen).\n\n\n==
    Clinical significance ==\n\n\n\n=== Inflammation ===\n\nAn inflammation of the
    epididymis is called epididymitis. \n\nIt is much more common than testicular
    inflammation, termed orchitis.\n\n\n=== Surgical removal ===\n\nEpididymotomy
    is the placing of an incision into the epididymis and is sometimes considered
    as a treatment option for acute suppurating epididymitis.\nEpididymectomy is
    the surgical removal of the epididymis sometimes performed for post-vasectomy
    pain syndrome and for refractory cases of epididymitis.\nEpididymectomy is also
    performed for sterilization on some male animals of livestock species so they
    can be used to detect estrus in females ready for artificially insemination.\n\n\n==

  descriptionText: "\n\nPANCREATIC DUCT\n\n\nThe pancreatic duct, or duct of Wirsung
    (also, the major pancreatic duct due to the existence of an accessory pancreatic
    duct), is a duct joining the pancreas to the common bile duct. \n\nThis supplies
    it with pancreatic juice from the exocrine pancreas, which aids in digestion.\n\n\n==
    Structure ==\n\nThe pancreatic duct joins the common bile duct just prior to
    the ampulla of Vater, after which both ducts perforate the medial side of the
    second portion of the duodenum at the major duodenal papilla. \n\nThere are many
    anatomical variants reported, but these are quite rare.\n\n\n=== Accessory pancreatic
    duct ===\n\nMost people have just one pancreatic duct. \n\nHowever, some have
    an additional accessory pancreatic duct, also called the Duct of Santorini. \n\nAn
    accessory pancreatic duct can be functional or non-functional. \n\nIt may open
    separately into the second part of the duodenum, which is dorsal, and usually
    (in 70% of people) drains into the duodenum via the minor duodenal papilla. \n\nIn
    the other 30% of people, it drains into the main pancreatic duct, which drains
    into the duodenum via the major duodenal papilla. \n\nThe main pancreatic duct
    and the accessory duct both eventually\u2014either directly or indirectly\u2014connect
    to the second part ('D2', the vertical segment) of the duodenum.\nIt is named
    for Giovanni Domenico Santorini.\n\n\n== Clinical significance ==\n\nCompression,
    obstruction or inflammation of the pancreatic duct may lead to acute pancreatitis.
    \n\nThe most common cause for obstruction is the presence of gallstones in the
    common bile duct, a condition called choledocholithiasis. \n\nObstruction can
    also be due to duodenal inflammation in Crohn's disease. \n\nA gallstone may
    get lodged in the constricted distal end of the ampulla of Vater, where it blocks
    the flow of both bile and pancreatic juice into the duodenum. \n\nBile backing
    up into the pancreatic duct may initiate pancreatitis. \n\nThe pancreatic duct
    is generally regarded as abnormally enlarged if being over 3 mm in the head and
    2 mm in the body or tail.Pancreatic ductal carcinoma is a common form of pancreatic
    cancer.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe pancreatic duct is also called the duct of
    Wirsung. \n\nThis is named after its discoverer, the German anatomist Johann
    Georg Wirsung (1589\u20131643).\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_duct"

  descriptionText: "\n\nURETER\n\n\nThe ureters are tubes made of smooth muscle that
    propel urine from the kidneys to the urinary bladder. \n\nIn a human adult, the
    ureters are usually 20\u201330 cm (8\u201312 in) long and around 3\u20134 mm
    (0.12\u20130.16 in) in diameter. \n\nThe ureter is lined by urothelial cells,
    a type of transitional epithelium, and has an additional smooth muscle layer
    that assists with peristalsis in its lowest third.\nThe ureters can be affected
    by a number of diseases, including urinary tract infections and kidney stone.
    \n\nStenosis is when a ureter is narrowed, due to for example chronic inflammation.
    \n\nCongenital abnormalities that affect the ureters can include the development
    of two ureters on the same side or abnormally placed ureters. \n\nAdditionally,
    reflux of urine from the bladder back up the ureters is a condition commonly
    seen in children.\nThe ureters have been identified for at least two thousand
    years, with the word \"ureter\" stemming from the stem uro- relating to urinating
    and seen in written records since at least the time of Hippocrates. \n\nIt is,
    however, only since the 1500s that the term \"ureter\" has been consistently
    used to refer to the modern structure, and only since the development of medical
    imaging in the 1900s that techniques such as X-ray, CT, and ultrasound have been
    able to view the ureters. \n\nThe ureters are also seen from the inside using
    a flexible camera, called ureteroscopy, which was first described in 1964.\n\n\n==
    Structure ==\n\n\nThe ureters are tubular structures, approximately 20\u201330
    cm (7.9\u201311.8 in) in adults, that pass from the pelvis of each kidney into
    the bladder. \n\nFrom the renal pelvis, they descend on top of the psoas major
    muscle to reach the brim of the pelvis. \n\nHere, they cross in front of the
    common iliac arteries. \n\nThey then pass down along the sides of the pelvis
    and finally curve forward and enter the bladder from its left and right sides
    at the back of the bladder. \n\nThe ureters are 1.5\u20136 mm (0.059\u20130.236
    in) in diameter and surrounded by a layer of smooth muscle for 1\u20132 cm (0.39\u20130.79
    in) near their ends just before they enter the bladder.The ureters enter the
    bladder from its back surface, traveling 1.5\u20132 cm (0.59\u20130.79 in) before
    opening into the bladder at an angle on its outer back surface at the slit-like
    ureteric orifices. \n\nThis location is also called the vesicoureteric junction.
    \n\nIn the contracted bladder, they are about 25 mm (1 in) apart and about the
    same distance from the internal urethral orifice; in the distended bladder, these
    measurements may be increased to about 50 mm (2 in).A number of structures pass
    by, above, and around the ureters on their path down from the kidneys to the
    bladder. \n\nIn its upper part, the ureter travels on the psoas major muscle
    and sits just behind the peritoneum. \n\nAs it passes down the muscle, it travels
    over the genitofemoral nerve. \n\nThe inferior vena cava and the abdominal aorta
    sit to the midline of the right and left ureters, respectively. \n\nIn the lower
    part of the abdomen, the right ureter sits behind the lower mesentery and the
    terminal ileum, and the left ureter sits behind the jejunum and the sigmoid colon.
    \n\nAs the ureters enter the pelvis, they are surrounded by connective tissue,
    and travel backward and outward, passing in front of the internal iliac arteries
    and internal iliac veins. \n\nThey then travel inward and forward, crossing the
    umbilical, inferior vesical, and middle rectal arteries. \n\nFrom here, in males,
    they cross under the vas deferens and in front of the seminal vesicles to enter
    the bladder near the trigone. \n\nIn females, the ureters pass behind the ovaries
    and then travel in the lower midline section of the broad ligament of the uterus.
    \n\nFor a short part, the uterine arteries travel on top for a short (2.5 cm
    (0.98 in)) period. \n\nThey then pass by the cervix, traveling inward towards
    the bladder.\n\n\n=== Blood and lymphatic supply ===\n\nThe arteries which supply
    the ureter vary along its course. \n\nThe upper third of the ureter, closest
    to the kidney, is supplied by the renal arteries. \n\nThe middle part of the
    ureter is supplied by the common iliac arteries, direct branches from the abdominal
    aorta, and gonadal arteries; the gonadal arteries being the testicular artery
    in men and the ovarian artery in women. \n\nThe lower third of the ureter, closest
    to the bladder, is supplied by branches from the internal iliac arteries, mainly
    the superior and inferior vesical arteries. \n\nThe arterial supply can be variable,
    with arteries that contribute include the middle rectal artery, branches directly
    from the aorta, and, in women, the uterine and vaginal arteries.The arteries
    that supply the ureters end in a network of vessels within the adventitia of
    the ureters. \n\nThere are many connections (anastamoses) between the arteries
    of the ureter, particularly in the adventitia, which means damage to a single
    vessel does not compromise the blood supply of the ureter. \n\nVenous drainage
    mostly parallels that of the arterial supply; that is, it begins as a network
    of smaller veins in the adventitia; with the renal veins draining the upper ureters,
    and the vesicular and gonadal veins draining the lower ureters.Lymphatic drainage
    depends on the position of lymphatic vessels in the ureter. \n\nLymph collects
    in submucosal, intramuscular and adventitial lymphatic vessels. \n\nThose vessels
    closer to the kidney drain into renal collecting vessels, and from here into
    the lateral aortic nodes near the gonadal vessels. \n\nThe middle part of the
    ureter drains into the right paracaval and interaortocaval nodes on the right,
    and the left paraaortic nodes on the left. \n\nIn the lower ureter, lymph may
    drain into the common iliac lymph nodes, or lower down in the pelvis to the common,
    external, or internal iliac lymph nodes.\n\n\n=== Nerve supply ===\n\nThe ureters
    are richly supplied by nerves that form a network (plexus) of nerves, the ureteric
    plexus that lies in the adventitia of the ureters. \n\nThis plexus is formed
    from a number of nerve roots directly (T9-12, L1, and S2-4), as well as branches
    from other nerve plexuses and nerves; specifically, the upper third of the ureter
    receives nerve branches from the renal plexus and aortic plexus, the middle part
    receives branches from the upper hypogastric plexus and nerve, and the lower
    ureter receives branches from the lower hypogastric plexus and nerve. \n\nThe
    plexus is in the adventitia. \n\nThese nerves travel in individual bundles and
    along small blood vessels to form the ureteric plexus. \n\nSensation supplied
    is sparse close to the kidneys and increases closer to the bladder.Sensation
    to the ureters is provided by nerves that come from T11 - L2 segments of the
    spinal cord. \n\nWhen pain is caused, for example by spasm of the ureters or
    by a stone, the pain may be referred to the dermatomes of T11 - L2, namely the
    back and sides of the abdomen, the scrotum (males) or labia majora (females)
    and upper part of the front of the thigh.\n\n\n=== Microanatomy ===\n\n\nThe
    ureter is lined by urothelium, a type of transitional epithelium that is capable
    of responding to stretches in the ureters. \n\nThe transitional epithelium may
    appear as a layer of column-shaped cells when relaxed, and of flatter cells when
    distended. \n\nBelow the epithelium sits the lamina propria. \n\nThe lamina propria
    is made up of loose connective tissue with many elastic fibers interspersed with
    blood vessels, veins and lymphatics. \n\nThe ureter is surrounded by two muscular
    layers, an inner longitudinal layer of muscle, and an outer circular or spiral
    layer of muscle. \n\nThe lower third of the ureter has a third muscular layer.
    \n\nBeyond these layers sits an adventitia containing blood vessels, lymphatic
    vessels, and veins.\n\n\n=== Development ===\n\n\nThe ureters develop from the
    ureteric buds, which are outpouchings from the mesonephric duct. \n\nThis is
    a duct, derived from mesoderm, found in the early embryo. \n\nOver time, the
    buds elongate, moving into surrounding mesodermal tissue, dilate, and divide
    into left and right ureters. \n\nEventually, successive divisions from these
    buds form not only the ureters, but also the pelvis, major and minor calyces,
    and collecting ducts of the kidneys.The mesonephric duct is connected with the
    cloaca, which over the course of development splits into a urogenital sinus and
    the anorectal canal. \n\nThe urinary bladder forms from the urogenital sinus.
    \n\nOver time, as the bladder enlarges, it absorbs the surrounding parts of the
    primitive ureters. \n\nFinally, the entry points of the ureters into the bladder
    move upwards, owing to the upward migration of the kidneys in the developing
    embryo.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\nThe ureters are a component of the urinary system.
    \n\nUrine, produced by the kidneys, travels along the ureters to the bladder.
    \n\nIt does this through regular contractions called peristalsis.\n\n\n== Clinical
    significance ==\n\n\n\n=== Ureteral stones ===\n\n\nA kidney stone can move from
    the kidney and become lodged inside the ureter, which can block the flow of urine,
    as well as cause a sharp cramp in the back, side, or lower abdomen. \n\nPain
    often comes in waves lasting up to two hours, then subsides, called renal colic.
    \n\nThe affected kidney could then develop hydronephrosis, should a part of the
    kidney become swollen due to blocked flow of urine. \n\nIt is classically described
    that there are three sites in the ureter where a kidney stone will commonly become
    stuck:\nwhere the ureter meets the renal pelvis; where the iliac blood vessels
    cross the ureters; and where the ureters enter the urinary bladder, however a
    retrospective case study, which is a primary source, of where stones lodged based
    on medical imaging did not show many stones at the place where the iliac blood
    vessels cross.Most stones are compounds containing calcium such as calcium oxalate
    and calcium phosphate. \n\nThe first recommended investigation is a CT scan of
    the abdomen because it can detect almost all stones. \n\nManagement includes
    analgesia, often with nonsteroidal antiinflammatories. \n\nSmall stones (< 4mm)
    may pass themselves; larger stones may require lithotripsy, and those with complications
    such as hydronephrosis or infection may require surgery to remove.\n\n\n=== Reflux
    ===\n\nVesicoureteral reflux refers to the reflux of fluid from the bladder into
    the ureters. \n\nThis condition can be associated with urinary tract infections,
    particularly in children, and is present in up to 28\u201336% of children to
    some degree. \n\nA number of forms of medical imaging are available for diagnosis
    of the condition, with modalities including doppler urinary tract ultrasound,
    MAG 3 nuclear medicine scaning, and a micturition urethrocystogram. \n\nFactors
    that affect which of these are selected depends if a child is able to receive
    a urinary catheter, and whether a child is toilet trained. \n\nWhether these
    investigations are performed at the first time a child has an illness, or later
    and depending on other factors (such as if the causal bacteria is E. coli) differ
    between US, EU and UK guidelines.Management is also variable, with differences
    between international guidelines on issues such as whether prophylactic antibiotics
    should be used, and whether surgery is recommended. \n\nOne reason is most instances
    of vesicoureteral reflux improve by themselves. \n\nIf surgery is considered,
    it generally involves reattaching the ureters to a different spot on the bladder,
    and extending the part of the ureter that it is within the wall of the bladder,
    with the most common surgical option being Cohen's cross-trigonal reimplantation.\n\n\n===
    Anatomical and surgical abnormalities ===\n\nBlockage, or obstruction of the
    ureter can occur, as a result of narrowing within the ureter, or compression
    or fibrosis of structures around the ureter. \n\nNarrowing can result of ureteric
    stones, masses associated with cancer, and other lesions such as endometriosis
    tuberculosis and schistosomiasis. \n\nThings outside the ureters such as constipation
    and retroperitoneal fibrosis can also compress them. \n\nSome congenital abnormalities
    can also result in narrowing or the ureters. \n\nCongenital disorders of the
    ureter and urinary tract affect 10% of infants. \n\nThese include partial or
    total duplication of the ureter (a duplex ureter), or the formation of a second
    irregularly placed (ectopic) ureter; or where the junction with the bladder is
    malformed or a ureterocoele develops (usually in that location). \n\nIf the ureters
    have been resited as a result of surgery, for example due to a kidney transplant
    or due to past surgery for vesicoureteric reflux, that site may also become narrowed.A
    narrowed ureter may lead to ureteric enlargement (dilation) and cause swelling
    of the kidneys (hydronephrosis). \n\nAssociated symptoms may include recurrent
    infections, pain or blood in the urine; and when tested, kidney function might
    be seen to decrease. \n\nThese are considered situations when surgery is needed.
    \n\nMedical imaging, including urinary tract ultrasound, CT or nuclear medicine
    imaging is conducted to investigate many causes. \n\nThis may involve reinserting
    the ureters into a new place on the bladder (reimplantion), or widening of the
    ureter. \n\nA ureteric stent may be inserted to relieve an obstruction. \n\nIf
    the cause cannot be removed, a nephrostomy may be required, which is the insertion
    of a tube connected to the renal pelvis which directly drains urine into a stoma
    bag.\n\n\n=== Cancer ===\n\nCancer of the ureters is known as ureteral cancer.
    \n\nIt is usually due to cancer of the urothelium, the cells that line the surface
    of the ureters. \n\nUrothelial cancer is more common after the age of 40, and
    more common in men than women; other risk factors include smoking and exposure
    to dyes such as aromatic amines and aldehydes. \n\nWhen cancer is present, the
    most common symptom in an affected person is blood in the urine; it may not cause
    symptoms, and a physical medical examination may be otherwise normal, except
    in late disease. \n\nUreteral cancer is most often due to cancer of the cells
    lining the ureter, called transitional cell carcinoma, although it can more rarely
    occur as a squamous cell carcinoma if the type of cells lining the urethra have
    changed due to chronic inflammation, such as due to stones or schistosomiasis.Investigations
    performed usually include collecting a sample of urine for an inspection for
    malignant cells under a microscope, called cytology, as well as medical imaging
    by a CT urogram or ultrasound. \n\nIf a concerning lesion is seen, a flexible
    camera may be inserted into the ureters, called ureteroscopy, in order to view
    the lesion and take a biopsy, and a CT scan will be performed of other body parts
    (a CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis) to look for additional metastatic
    lesions. \n\nAfter the cancer is staged, treatment may involve open surgery to
    remove the affected ureter and kidney if it is involved; or, if the lesion is
    small, it may be removed via ureteroscopy. \n\nPrognosis can vary markedly depending
    on the tumour grade, with a worse prognosis associated with an ulcerating lesion.\n\n\n===
    Injury ===\n\nInjuries to the ureter can occur after penetrating abdominal injuries,
    and injuries at high speeds followed by an abrupt stop (such as a high speed
    car accident). \n\nThe ureter can be injured during surgery to nearby structures.
    \n\nIt is injured in 2 per 10,000 cases of vaginal hysterectomies and 13 per
    10,000 cases of abdominal hysterectomies, usually near the suspensory ligament
    of the ovary or near the cardinal ligament, where the ureter runs close to the
    blood vessels of the uterus.\n\n\n=== Imaging ===\n\nSeveral forms of medical
    imaging exist that are used to view the ureters and urinary tract. \n\nUltrasound
    may be able to show evidence of blockage because of hydronephrosis of the kidneys
    and renal pelvis. \n\nCT scans, including ones where contrast media is injected
    intravenously to better show the ureters, and with contrast to better show lesions,
    and to differentiate benign from malignant lesions. \n\nDye may also be injected
    directly into the ureters or renal tract; an antegrade pyelogram is when contrast
    is injected directly into the renal pelvis, and a retrograde pyelogram is where
    dye is injected into the urinary tract via a catheter, and flows backwards into
    the ureters. \n\nMore invasive forms of imaging include ureteroscopy, which is
    the insertion of a flexible endoscope into the urinary tract to view the ureters.
    \n\nUreteroscopy is most commonly used for medium to large-sized stones when
    less invasive methods of removal are not able to be used.\n\n\n== Other animals
    ==\n\nAll vertebrates have two kidneys located behind the abdomen that produce
    urine, and have a way of excreting it, so that waste products within the urine
    can be removed from the body. \n\nThe structure specifically called the ureter
    is present in amniotes, meaning mammals, birds and reptiles. \n\nThese animals
    possess an adult kidney derived from the metanephros. \n\nThe duct that connects
    the kidney to excrete urine in these animals is the ureter. \n\nIt connects to
    the urinary bladder, from whence urine leaves via the urethra.\n\n\n== History
    ==\n\nThe word \"ureter\" comes from the Ancient Greek stem \"uro\" relating
    to urination, and the first use of the word is seen during the era of Hippocrates
    to refer to the urethra. \n\nThe anatomical structure of the ureter was noted
    by 40 AD. \n\nHowever, the terms \"ureter\" and \"urethra\" were variably used
    to refer to each other thereafter for more than a millennium. \n\nIt was only
    in the 1550s that anatomists such as Bartolomeo Eustacchio and Jacques Dubois
    began to use the terms to specifically and consistently refer to what is in modern
    English called the ureter and the urethra. \n\nFollowing this, in the 19th and
    20th centuries multiple terms relating to the structures such as ureteritis and
    ureterography, were coined.Kidney stones have been identified and recorded about
    as long as written historical records exist. \n\nThe urinary tract including
    the ureters, as well as their function to drain urine from the kidneys, has been
    described by Galen in the second century AD.The first to examine the ureter through
    an internal approach, called ureteroscopy, rather than surgery was Hampton Young
    in 1929. \n\nThis was improved on by VF Marshall who is the first published use
    of a flexible endoscope based on fiber optics, which occurred in 1964. \n\nThe
    insertion of a drainage tube into the renal pelvis, bypassing the ureters and
    urinary tract, called nephrostomy, was first described in 1941. \n\nSuch an approach
    differed greatly from the open surgical approaches within the urinary system
    employed during the preceding two millennia.The first radiological imaging of
    the ureters first occurred via X-rays, although this was made more difficult
    by the thick abdomen, which the low power of the original X-rays was not able
    to penetrate enough to produce clear images. \n\nMore useful images were able
    to be produced when Edwin Hurry Fenwick in 1908 pioneered the use of tubes covered
    in radioopaque material visible to X-rays inserted into the ureters, and in the
    early 20th century when contrasts were injected externally into the urinary tract
    (retrograde pyelograms). \n\nUnfortunately, much of the earlier retrograde pyelograms
    were complicated by significant damage to the kidneys as a result of contrast
    based on silver or sodium iodide. \n\nHryntshalk in 1929 pioneered the development
    of the intravenous urogram, in which contrast is injected into a vein and highlights
    the kidney and, when excreted, the urinary tract. \n\nThings improved with the
    development by Moses Swick and Leopold Lichtwitz in the late 1920s of relatively
    nontoxic contrast media, with controversy surrounding publication as to who was
    the primary discoverer. \n\nSide-effects associated with imaging improved even
    more when Tosten Almen published a ground-breaking thesis in 1969 based on the
    less toxic low-osmolar contrast media, developed based on swimming experiences
    in lakes with different salinity.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ureter"

  descriptionText: "\n\nSUPRARENAL GLAND/ADRENAL GLAND\n\n\nThe suprarenal glands
    (also known as adrenal glands) are endocrine glands that produce a variety of
    hormones including suprarenaline and the steroids aldosterone and cortisol. \n\nThey
    are found above the kidneys. \n\nEach gland has an outer cortex which produces
    steroid hormones and an inner medulla. \n\nThe suprarenal cortex itself is divided
    into three main zones: the zona glomerulosa, the zona fasciculata and the zona
    reticularis.\n\nThe suprarenal cortex produces three main types of steroid hormones:
    mineralocorticoids, glucocorticoids, and androgens. \n\nMineralocorticoids (such
    as aldosterone) produced in the zona glomerulosa help in the regulation of blood
    pressure and electrolyte balance. \n\nThe glucocorticoids cortisol and cortisone
    are synthesized in the zona fasciculata; their functions include the regulation
    of metabolism and immune system suppression. \n\nThe innermost layer of the cortex,
    the zona reticularis, produces androgens that are converted to fully functional
    sex hormones in the gonads and other target organs. \n\nThe production of steroid
    hormones is called steroidogenesis, and involves a number of reactions and processes
    that take place in cortical cells. \n\nThe medulla produces the catecholamines,
    which function to produce a rapid response throughout the body in stress situations.\n\nA
    number of endocrine diseases involve dysfunctions of the suprarenal gland. \n\nOverproduction
    of cortisol leads to Cushing's syndrome, whereas insufficient production is associated
    with Addison's disease. \n\nCongenital suprarenal hyperplasia is a genetic disease
    produced by dysregulation of endocrine control mechanisms. \n\nA variety of tumors
    can arise from suprarenal tissue and are commonly found in medical imaging when
    searching for other diseases.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\n\nThe suprarenal glands
    are located on both sides of the body in the retroperitoneum, above and slightly
    medial to the kidneys. \n\nIn humans, the right suprarenal gland is pyramidal
    in shape, whereas the left is semilunar or crescent shaped and somewhat larger.
    \n\nThe suprarenal glands measure approximately 3 cm in width, 5.0 cm in length,
    and up to 1.0 cm in thickness. \n\nTheir combined weight in an adult human ranges
    from 7 to 10 grams. \n\nThe glands are yellowish in colour.\n\nThe suprarenal
    glands are surrounded by a fatty capsule and lie within the renal fascia, which
    also surrounds the kidneys. \n\nA weak septum (wall) of connective tissue separates
    the glands from the kidneys. \n\nThe suprarenal glands are directly below the
    diaphragm, and are attached to the crura of the diaphragm by the renal fascia.\n\nEach
    suprarenal gland has two distinct parts, each with a unique function, the outer
    suprarenal cortex and the inner medulla, both of which produce hormones.\n\n\n===
    suprarenal cortex ===\n\n\nThe suprarenal cortex is the outer region and also
    the largest part of an suprarenal gland. \n\nIt is divided into three separate
    zones: zona glomerulosa, zona fasciculata and zona reticularis. \n\nEach zone
    is responsible for producing specific hormones.\nThe suprarenal cortex is the
    outermost layer of the suprarenal gland. \n\nWithin the cortex are three layers,
    called \"zones\". \n\nWhen viewed under a microscope each layer has a distinct
    appearance, and each has a different function. \n\nThe suprarenal cortex is devoted
    to production of hormones, namely aldosterone, cortisol, and androgens.\n\n\n====
    Zona glomerulosa ====\nThe outermost zone of the suprarenal cortex is the zona
    glomerulosa. \n\nIt lies immediately under the fibrous capsule of the gland.
    \n\nCells in this layer form oval groups, separated by thin strands of connective
    tissue from the fibrous capsule of the gland and carry wide capillaries.\n\nThis
    layer is the main site for production of aldosterone, a mineralocorticoid, by
    the action of the enzyme aldosterone synthase. \n\nAldosterone plays an important
    role in the long-term regulation of blood pressure.\n\n\n==== Zona fasciculata
    ====\nThe zona fasciculata is situated between the zona glomerulosa and zona
    reticularis. \n\nCells in this layer are responsible for producing glucocorticoids
    such as cortisol. \n\nIt is the largest of the three layers, accounting for nearly
    80% of the volume of the cortex. \n\nIn the zona fasciculata, cells are arranged
    in columns radially oriented towards the medulla. \n\nCells contain numerous
    lipid droplets, abundant mitochondria and a complex smooth endoplasmic reticulum.\n\n\n====
    Zona reticularis ====\nThe innermost cortical layer, the zona reticularis, lies
    directly adjacent to the medulla. \n\nIt produces androgens, mainly dehydroepiandrosterone
    (DHEA), DHEA sulfate (DHEA-S), and androstenedione (the precursor to testosterone)
    in humans. \n\nIts small cells form irregular cords and clusters, separated by
    capillaries and connective tissue. \n\nThe cells contain relatively small quantities
    of cytoplasm and lipid droplets, and sometimes display brown lipofuscin pigment.\n\n\n===
    Medulla ===\n\n\nThe suprarenal medulla is at the centre of each suprarenal gland,
    and is surrounded by the suprarenal cortex. \n\nThe chromaffin cells of the medulla
    are the body's main source of the catecholamines, such as suprarenaline and norsuprarenaline,
    released by the medulla. \n\nApproximately 20% norsuprarenaline (norepinephrine)
    and 80% suprarenaline (epinephrine) are secreted here.\n\nThe suprarenal medulla
    is driven by the sympathetic nervous system via preganglionic fibers originating
    in the thoracic spinal cord, from vertebrae T5\u2013T11. \n\nBecause it is innervated
    by preganglionic nerve fibers, the suprarenal medulla can be considered as a
    specialized sympathetic ganglion. \n\nUnlike other sympathetic ganglia, however,
    the suprarenal medulla lacks distinct synapses and releases its secretions directly
    into the blood.\n\n\n=== Blood supply ===\n\nThe suprarenal glands have one of
    the greatest blood supply rates per gram of tissue of any organ: up to 60 small
    arteries may enter each gland. \n\nThree arteries usually supply each suprarenal
    gland:\nThe superior suprarenal artery, a branch of the inferior phrenic artery\n-The
    middle suprarenal artery, a direct branch of the abdominal aorta\n-The inferior
    suprarenal artery, a branch of the renal arteryThese blood vessels supply a network
    of small arteries within the capsule of the suprarenal glands. \n\nThin strands
    of the capsule enter the glands, carrying blood to them.\n\nVenous blood is drained
    from the glands by the suprarenal veins, usually one for each gland:\n-The right
    suprarenal vein drains into the inferior vena cava\n-The left suprarenal vein
    drains into the left renal vein or the left inferior phrenic vein.The central
    adrenomedullary vein, in the suprarenal medulla, is an unusual type of blood
    vessel. \n\nIts structure is different from the other veins in that the smooth
    muscle in its tunica media (the middle layer of the vessel) is arranged in conspicuous,
    longitudinally oriented bundles.\n\n\n=== Variability ===\n\nThe suprarenal glands
    may not develop at all, or may be fused in the midline behind the aorta. \n\nThese
    are associated with other congenital abnormalities, such as failure of the kidneys
    to develop, or fused kidneys. \n\nThe gland may develop with a partial or complete
    absence of the cortex, or may develop in an unusual location.\n\n\n== Function
    ==\n\n\nThe suprarenal gland secretes a number of different hormones which are
    metabolised by enzymes either within the gland or in other parts of the body.
    \n\nThese hormones are involved in a number of essential biological functions.\n\n\n===
    Corticosteroids ===\n\nCorticosteroids are a group of steroid hormones produced
    from the cortex of the suprarenal gland, from which they are named.\nMineralocorticoids
    such as aldosterone regulate salt (\"mineral\") balance and blood volume.\n\nGlucocorticoids
    such as cortisol influence metabolism rates of proteins, fats and sugars (\"glucose\").\n\nAndrogens
    such as dehydroepiandrosterone.MineralocorticoidsThe suprarenal gland produces
    aldosterone, a mineralocorticoid, which is important in the regulation of salt
    (\"mineral\") balance and blood volume. \n\nIn the kidneys, aldosterone acts
    on the distal convoluted tubules and the collecting ducts by increasing the reabsorption
    of sodium and the excretion of both potassium and hydrogen ions. \n\nAldosterone
    is responsible for the reabsorption of about 2% of filtered glomerular filtrate.
    \n\nSodium retention is also a response of the distal colon and sweat glands
    to aldosterone receptor stimulation. \n\nAngiotensin II and extracellular potassium
    are the two main regulators of aldosterone production. \n\nThe amount of sodium
    present in the body affects the extracellular volume, which in turn influences
    blood pressure. \n\nTherefore, the effects of aldosterone in sodium retention
    are important for the regulation of blood pressure.\n\nGlucocorticoidsCortisol
    is the main glucocorticoid in humans. \n\nIn species that do not create cortisol,
    this role is played by corticosterone instead. \n\nGlucocorticoids have many
    effects on metabolism. \n\nAs their name suggests, they increase the circulating
    level of glucose. \n\nThis is the result of an increase in the mobilization of
    amino acids from protein and the stimulation of synthesis of glucose from these
    amino acids in the liver. \n\nIn addition, they increase the levels of free fatty
    acids, which cells can use as an alternative to glucose to obtain energy. \n\nGlucocorticoids
    also have effects unrelated to the regulation of blood sugar levels, including
    the suppression of the immune system and a potent anti-inflammatory effect. \n\nCortisol
    reduces the capacity of osteoblasts to produce new bone tissue and decreases
    the absorption of calcium in the gastrointestinal tract.The suprarenal gland
    secretes a basal level of cortisol but can also produce bursts of the hormone
    in response to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) from the anterior pituitary.
    \n\nCortisol is not evenly released during the day \u2013 its concentrations
    in the blood are highest in the early morning and lowest in the evening as a
    result of the circadian rhythm of ACTH secretion. \n\nCortisone is an inactive
    product of the action of the enzyme 11\u03B2-HSD on cortisol. \n\nThe reaction
    catalyzed by 11\u03B2-HSD is reversible, which means that it can turn administered
    cortisone into cortisol, the biologically active hormone.\n\nFormation\n\nAll
    corticosteroid hormones share cholesterol as a common precursor. \n\nTherefore,
    the first step in steroidogenesis is cholesterol uptake or synthesis. \n\nCells
    that produce steroid hormones can acquire cholesterol through two paths. \n\nThe
    main source is through dietary cholesterol transported via the blood as cholesterol
    esters within low density lipoproteins (LDL). \n\nLDL enters the cells through
    receptor-mediated endocytosis. \n\nThe other source of cholesterol is synthesis
    in the cell's endoplasmic reticulum. \n\nSynthesis can compensate when LDL levels
    are abnormally low. \n\nIn the lysosome, cholesterol esters are converted to
    free cholesterol, which is then used for steroidogenesis or stored in the cell.\n\nThe
    initial part of conversion of cholesterol into steroid hormones involves a number
    of enzymes of the cytochrome P450 family that are located in the inner membrane
    of mitochondria. \n\nTransport of cholesterol from the outer to the inner membrane
    is facilitated by steroidogenic acute regulatory protein and is the rate-limiting
    step of steroid synthesis.\n\nThe layers of the suprarenal gland differ by function,
    with each layer having distinct enzymes that produce different hormones from
    a common precursor. \n\nThe first enzymatic step in the production of all steroid
    hormones is cleavage of the cholesterol side chain, a reaction that forms pregnenolone
    as a product and is catalyzed by the enzyme P450scc, also known as cholesterol
    desmolase. \n\nAfter the production of pregnenolone, specific enzymes of each
    cortical layer further modify it. \n\nEnzymes involved in this process include
    both mitochondrial and microsomal P450s and hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases. \n\nUsually
    a number of intermediate steps in which pregnenolone is modified several times
    are required to form the functional hormones. \n\nEnzymes that catalyze reactions
    in these metabolic pathways are involved in a number of endocrine diseases. \n\nFor
    example, the most common form of congenital suprarenal hyperplasia develops as
    a result of deficiency of 21-hydroxylase, an enzyme involved in an intermediate
    step of cortisol production.\n\nRegulation\n\nGlucocorticoids are under the regulatory
    influence of the hypothalamus-pituitary-suprarenal (HPA) axis. \n\nGlucocorticoid
    synthesis is stimulated by adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), a hormone released
    into the bloodstream by the anterior pituitary. \n\nIn turn, production of ACTH
    is stimulated by the presence of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), which
    is released by neurons of the hypothalamus. \n\nACTH acts on the suprarenal cells
    first by increasing the levels of StAR within the cells, and then of all steroidogenic
    P450 enzymes. \n\nThe HPA axis is an example of a negative feedback system, in
    which cortisol itself acts as a direct inhibitor of both CRH and ACTH synthesis.
    \n\nThe HPA axis also interacts with the immune system through increased secretion
    of ACTH at the presence of certain molecules of the inflammatory response.Mineralocorticoid
    secretion is regulated mainly by the renin\u2013angiotensin\u2013aldosterone
    system (RAAS), the concentration of potassium, and to a lesser extent the concentration
    of ACTH. \n\nSensors of blood pressure in the juxtaglomerular apparatus of the
    kidneys release the enzyme renin into the blood, which starts a cascade of reactions
    that lead to formation of angiotensin II. \n\nAngiotensin receptors in cells
    of the zona glomerulosa recognize the substance, and upon binding they stimulate
    the release of aldosterone.\n\n\n=== Androgens ===\n\nCells in zona reticularis
    of the suprarenal glands produce male sex hormones, or androgens, the most important
    of which is DHEA. \n\nIn general, these hormones do not have an overall effect
    in the male body, and are converted to more potent androgens such as testosterone
    and DHT or to estrogens (female sex hormones) in the gonads, acting in this way
    as a metabolic intermediate.\n\n\n=== Catecholamines ===\n\nPrimarily referred
    to in the United States as epinephrine and norepinephrine, suprarenaline and
    norsuprarenaline are catecholamines, water-soluble compounds that have a structure
    made of a catechol group and an amine group. \n\nThe suprarenal glands are responsible
    for most of the suprarenaline that circulates in the body, but only for a small
    amount of circulating norsuprarenaline. \n\nThese hormones are released by the
    suprarenal medulla, which contains a dense network of blood vessels. \n\nsuprarenaline
    and norsuprarenaline act at adrenoreceptors throughout the body, with effects
    that include an increase in blood pressure and heart rate. \n\nActions of suprarenaline
    and norsuprarenaline are responsible for the fight or flight response, characterised
    by a quickening of breathing and heart rate, an increase in blood pressure, and
    constriction of blood vessels in many parts of the body.\n\nFormationCatecholamines
    are produced in chromaffin cells in the medulla of the suprarenal gland, from
    tyrosine, a non-essential amino acid derived from food or produced from phenylalanine
    in the liver. \n\nThe enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase converts tyrosine to L-DOPA
    in the first step of catecholamine synthesis. \n\nL-DOPA is then converted to
    dopamine before it can be turned into norsuprarenaline. \n\nIn the cytosol, norsuprarenaline
    is converted to epinephrine by the enzyme phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase
    (PNMT) and stored in granules. \n\nGlucocorticoids produced in the suprarenal
    cortex stimulate the synthesis of catecholamines by increasing the levels of
    tyrosine hydroxylase and PNMT.Catecholamine release is stimulated by the activation
    of the sympathetic nervous system. \n\nSplanchnic nerves of the sympathetic nervous
    system innervate the medulla of the suprarenal gland. \n\nWhen activated, it
    evokes the release of catecholamines from the storage granules by stimulating
    the opening of calcium channels in the cell membrane.\n\n\n== Gene and protein
    expression ==\n\n\nThe human genome includes approximately 20,000 protein coding
    genes and 70% of these genes are expressed in the normal adult suprarenal glands.
    \n\nOnly some 250 genes are more specifically expressed in the suprarenal glands
    compared to other organs and tissues. \n\nThe suprarenal-gland-specific genes
    with the highest level of expression include members of the cytochrome P450 superfamily
    of enzymes. \n\nCorresponding proteins are expressed in the different compartments
    of the suprarenal gland, such as CYP11A1, HSD3B2 and FDX1 involved in steroid
    hormone synthesis and expressed in cortical cell layers, and PNMT and DBH involved
    in norsuprarenaline and suprarenaline synthesis and expressed in the medulla.\n\n\n==
    Development ==\n\nThe suprarenal glands are composed of two heterogenous types
    of tissue. \n\nIn the center is the suprarenal medulla, which produces suprarenaline
    and norsuprarenaline and releases them into the bloodstream, as part of the sympathetic
    nervous system. \n\nSurrounding the medulla is the cortex, which produces a variety
    of steroid hormones. \n\nThese tissues come from different embryological precursors
    and have distinct prenatal development paths. \n\nThe cortex of the suprarenal
    gland is derived from mesoderm, whereas the medulla is derived from the neural
    crest, which is of ectodermal origin.\n\nThe suprarenal glands in a newborn baby
    are much larger as a proportion of the body size than in an adult. \n\nFor example,
    at age three months the glands are four times the size of the kidneys. \n\nThe
    size of the glands decreases relatively after birth, mainly because of shrinkage
    of the cortex. \n\nThe cortex, which almost completely disappears by age 1, develops
    again from age 4\u20135. \n\nThe glands weigh about 1 g at birth and develop
    to an adult weight of about 4 grams each. \n\nIn a fetus the glands are first
    detectable after the sixth week of development.\n\n\n=== Cortex ===\n\nsuprarenal
    cortex tissue is derived from the intermediate mesoderm. \n\nIt first appears
    33 days after fertilisation, shows steroid hormone production capabilities by
    the eighth week and undergoes rapid growth during the first trimester of pregnancy.
    \n\nThe fetal suprarenal cortex is different from its adult counterpart, as it
    is composed of two distinct zones: the inner \"fetal\" zone, which carries most
    of the hormone-producing activity, and the outer \"definitive\" zone, which is
    in a proliferative phase. \n\nThe fetal zone produces large amounts of suprarenal
    androgens (male sex hormones) that are used by the placenta for estrogen biosynthesis.
    \n\nCortical development of the suprarenal gland is regulated mostly by ACTH,
    a hormone produced by the pituitary gland that stimulates cortisol synthesis.
    \n\nDuring midgestation, the fetal zone occupies most of the cortical volume
    and produces 100\u2013200 mg/day of DHEA-S, an androgen and precursor of both
    androgens and estrogens (female sex hormones). \n\nsuprarenal hormones, especially
    glucocorticoids such as cortisol, are essential for prenatal development of organs,
    particularly for the maturation of the lungs. \n\nThe suprarenal gland decreases
    in size after birth because of the rapid disappearance of the fetal zone, with
    a corresponding decrease in androgen secretion.\n\n\n==== Adrenarche ====\n\nDuring
    early childhood androgen synthesis and secretion remain low, but several years
    before puberty (from 6\u20138 years of age) changes occur in both anatomical
    and functional aspects of cortical androgen production that lead to increased
    secretion of the steroids DHEA and DHEA-S. \n\nThese changes are part of a process
    called adrenarche, which has only been described in humans and some other primates.
    \n\nAdrenarche is independent of ACTH or gonadotropins and correlates with a
    progressive thickening of the zona reticularis layer of the cortex. \n\nFunctionally,
    adrenarche provides a source of androgens for the development of axillary and
    pubic hair before the beginning of puberty.\n\n\n=== Medulla ===\n\nThe suprarenal
    medulla is derived from neural crest cells, which come from the ectoderm layer
    of the embryo. \n\nThese cells migrate from their initial position and aggregate
    in the vicinity of the dorsal aorta, a primitive blood vessel, which activates
    the differentiation of these cells through the release of proteins known as BMPs.
    \n\nThese cells then undergo a second migration from the dorsal aorta to form
    the suprarenal medulla and other organs of the sympathetic nervous system. \n\nCells
    of the suprarenal medulla are called chromaffin cells because they contain granules
    that stain with chromium salts, a characteristic not present in all sympathetic
    organs. \n\nGlucocorticoids produced in the suprarenal cortex were once thought
    to be responsible for the differentiation of chromaffin cells. \n\nMore recent
    research suggests that BMP-4 secreted in suprarenal tissue is the main responsible
    for this, and that glucocorticoids only play a role in the subsequent development
    of the cells.\n\n\n== Clinical significance ==\n\n\nThe normal function of the
    suprarenal gland may be impaired by conditions such as infections, tumors, genetic
    disorders and autoimmune diseases, or as a side effect of medical therapy. \n\nThese
    disorders affect the gland either directly (as with infections or autoimmune
    diseases) or as a result of the dysregulation of hormone production (as in some
    types of Cushing's syndrome) leading to an excess or insufficiency of suprarenal
    hormones and the related symptoms.\n\n\n=== Corticosteroid overproduction ===\n\n\n\n====
    Cushing's syndrome ====\nCushing's syndrome is the manifestation of glucocorticoid
    excess. \n\nIt can be the result of a prolonged treatment with glucocorticoids
    or be caused by an underlying disease which produces alterations in the HPA axis
    or the production of cortisol. \n\nCauses can be further classified into ACTH-dependent
    or ACTH-independent. \n\nThe most common cause of endogenous Cushing's syndrome
    is a pituitary adenoma which causes an excessive production of ACTH. \n\nThe
    disease produces a wide variety of signs and symptoms which include obesity,
    diabetes, increased blood pressure, excessive body hair (hirsutism), osteoporosis,
    depression, and most distinctively, stretch marks in the skin, caused by its
    progressive thinning.\n\n\n==== Primary aldosteronism ====\n\nWhen the zona glomerulosa
    produces excess aldosterone, the result is primary aldosteronism. \n\nCauses
    for this condition are bilateral hyperplasia (excessive tissue growth) of the
    glands, or aldosterone-producing adenomas (a condition called Conn's syndrome).
    \n\nPrimary aldosteronism produces hypertension and electrolyte imbalance, increasing
    potassium depletion sodium retention.\n\n\n=== suprarenal insufficiency ===\n\nsuprarenal
    insufficiency (the deficiency of glucocorticoids) occurs in about 5 in 10,000
    in the general population. \n\nDiseases classified as primary suprarenal insufficiency
    (including Addison's disease and genetic causes) directly affect the suprarenal
    cortex. \n\nIf a problem that affects the hypothalamic-pituitary-suprarenal axis
    arises outside the gland, it is a secondary suprarenal insufficiency.\n\n\n====
    Addison's disease ====\n\nAddison's disease refers to primary hyposuprarenalism,
    which is a deficiency in glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid production by the
    suprarenal gland. \n\nIn the Western world, Addison's disease is most commonly
    an autoimmune condition, in which the body produces antibodies against cells
    of the suprarenal cortex. \n\nWorldwide, the disease is more frequently caused
    by infection, especially from tuberculosis. \n\nA distinctive feature of Addison's
    disease is hyperpigmentation of the skin, which presents with other nonspecific
    symptoms such as fatigue.\n\nA complication seen in untreated Addison's disease
    and other types of primary suprarenal insufficiency is the suprarenal crisis,
    a medical emergency in which low glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid levels
    result in hypovolemic shock and symptoms such as vomiting and fever. \n\nAn suprarenal
    crisis can progressively lead to stupor and coma. \n\nThe management of suprarenal
    crises includes the application of hydrocortisone injections.\n\n\n==== Secondary
    suprarenal insufficiency ====\n\nIn secondary suprarenal insufficiency, a dysfunction
    of the hypothalamic-pituitary-suprarenal axis leads to decreased stimulation
    of the suprarenal cortex. \n\nApart from suppression of the axis by glucocorticoid
    therapy, the most common cause of secondary suprarenal insufficiency are tumors
    that affect the production of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) by the pituitary
    gland. \n\nThis type of suprarenal insufficiency usually does not affect the
    production of mineralocorticoids, which are under regulation of the renin\u2013angiotensin
    system instead.\n\n\n==== Congenital suprarenal hyperplasia ====\n\nCongenital
    suprarenal hyperplasia is a congenital disease in which mutations of enzymes
    that produce steroid hormones result in a glucocorticoid deficiency and malfunction
    of the negative feedback loop of the HPA axis. \n\nIn the HPA axis, cortisol
    (a glucocorticoid) inhibits the release of CRH and ACTH, hormones that in turn
    stimulate corticosteroid synthesis. \n\nAs cortisol cannot be synthesized, these
    hormones are released in high quantities and stimulate production of other suprarenal
    steroids instead. \n\nThe most common form of congenital suprarenal hyperplasia
    is due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency. 21-hydroxylase is necessary for production
    of both mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids, but not androgens. \n\nTherefore,
    ACTH stimulation of the suprarenal cortex induces the release of excessive amounts
    of suprarenal androgens, which can lead to the development of ambiguous genitalia
    and secondary sex characteristics.\n\n\n=== suprarenal tumors ===\n\n\nsuprarenal
    tumors are commonly found as incidentalomas, unexpected asymptomatic tumors found
    during medical imaging. \n\nThey are seen in around 3.4% of CT scans, and in
    most cases they are benign adenomas. \n\nsuprarenal carcinomas are very rare,
    with an incidence of 1 case per million per year.Pheochromocytomas are tumors
    of the suprarenal medulla that arise from chromaffin cells. \n\nThey can produce
    a variety of nonspecific symptoms, which include headaches, sweating, anxiety
    and palpitations. \n\nCommon signs include hypertension and tachycardia. \n\nSurgery,
    especially suprarenal laparoscopy, is the most common treatment for small pheochromocytomas.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/suprarenal_gland"

  descriptionText: "\n\nSUBMANDIBULAR DUCT\n\n\nThe submandibular duct or Wharton
    duct or submaxillary duct, is one of the salivary excretory ducts. \n\nIt is
    about 5 cm. long, and its wall is much thinner than that of the parotid duct.
    \n\nIt drains saliva from each bilateral submandibular gland and sublingual gland
    to the sublingual caruncle at the base of the tongue.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\n\nThe
    submandibular duct arises from deep part of submandibular gland, a salivary gland.
    \n\nIt begins by numerous branches from the superficial surface of the gland,
    and runs forward between the mylohyoid, hyoglossus, and genioglossus muscles.
    \n\nIt then passes between the sublingual gland and the genioglossus and opens
    by a narrow opening on the summit of a small papilla (the \"sublingual caruncle\")
    at the side of the frenulum of the tongue. \n\nIt lies superior to lingual and
    hypoglossal nerves.\n\n\n=== Variation ===\n\nThe submandibular duct may be duplicated
    on one side or both sides, creating an accessory submandibular duct. \n\nRarely,
    it may not perforate into the mouth.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\nThe submandibular
    ducts drain saliva from the submandibular gland, and the sublingual glands to
    the sublingual caruncles at the base of the tongue.\n\n\n== Clinical significance
    ==\n\n\n=== Sialolithiasis ===\n\nThe submandibular duct may be affected by stones,
    known as sialolithiasis. \n\nThese may grow large, requiring surgery to remove.
    \n\nSimple palpation may be used to identify the location of any stones before
    surgery.\n\n\n=== Imperforate ===\n\nRarely, the submandibular duct may not perforate
    into the mouth. \n\nSurgery may be used to repair this birth defect.\n\n\n===
    Drooling ===\n\nThe exit of the submandibular gland into the mouth may be realigned
    in patients who drool. \n\nThis redirects the exiting saliva away from the vestibule
    and the lips. \n\nThis surgery has a fairly high success rate. \n\nRarely, the
    submandibular gland may need to be removed on one or both sides.\n\n\n== History
    ==\n\nThe submandibular duct was initially described by the English anatomist
    Thomas Wharton ( 1614-73) and is sometimes referred to by his name.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submandibular_duct"

  descriptionText: "\n\nTONGUE\n\n\nThe tongue is a muscular organ in the mouth of
    a typical tetrapod. \n\nIt manipulates food for mastication and swallowing as
    part of the digestive process, and is the primary organ of taste. \n\nThe tongue's
    upper surface (dorsum) is covered by taste buds housed in numerous lingual papillae.
    \n\nIt is sensitive and kept moist by saliva and is richly supplied with nerves
    and blood vessels. \n\nThe tongue also serves as a natural means of cleaning
    the teeth. \n\nA major function of the tongue is the enabling of speech in humans
    and vocalization in other animals.\nThe human tongue is divided into two parts,
    an oral part at the front and a pharyngeal part at the back. \n\nThe left and
    right sides are also separated along most of its length by a vertical section
    of fibrous tissue (the lingual septum) that results in a groove, the median sulcus,
    on the tongue's surface.\nThere are two groups of muscles of the tongue. \n\nThe
    four intrinsic muscles alter the shape of the tongue and are not attached to
    bone. \n\nThe four paired extrinsic muscles change the position of the tongue
    and are anchored to bone.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe word tongue derives from
    the Old English tunge, which comes from Proto-Germanic *tung\u014Dn. \n\nIt has
    cognates in other Germanic languages\u2014for example tonge in West Frisian,
    tong in Dutch and Afrikaans, Zunge in German, tunge in Danish and Norwegian,
    and tunga in Icelandic, Faroese and Swedish. \n\nThe ue ending of the word seems
    to be a fourteenth-century attempt to show \"proper pronunciation\", but it is
    \"neither etymological nor phonetic\". \n\nSome used the spelling tunge and tonge
    as late as the sixteenth century.\n\n\n== In humans ==\n\n\n\n=== Structure ===\n\n\nThe
    tongue is a muscular hydrostat that forms part of the floor of the oral cavity.
    \n\nThe left and right sides of the tongue are separated by a vertical section
    of fibrous tissue known as the lingual septum. \n\nThis division is along the
    length of the tongue save for the very back of the pharyngeal part and is visible
    as a groove called the median sulcus. \n\nThe human tongue is divided into anterior
    and posterior parts by the terminal sulcus which is a V-shaped groove. \n\nThe
    apex of the terminal sulcus is marked by a blind foramen, the foramen cecum,
    which is a remnant of the median thyroid diverticulum in early embryonic development.
    \n\nThe anterior oral part is the visible part situated at the front and makes
    up roughly two-thirds the length of the tongue. \n\nThe posterior pharyngeal
    part is the part closest to the throat, roughly one-third of its length. \n\nThese
    parts differ in terms of their embryological development and nerve supply.\nThe
    anterior tongue is, at its apex, thin and narrow. \n\nIt is directed forward
    against the lingual surfaces of the lower incisor teeth. \n\nThe posterior part
    is, at its root, directed backward, and connected with the hyoid bone by the
    hyoglossi and genioglossi muscles and the hyoglossal membrane, with the epiglottis
    by three glossoepiglottic folds of mucous membrane, with the soft palate by the
    glossopalatine arches, and with the pharynx by the superior pharyngeal constrictor
    muscle and the mucous membrane. \n\nIt also forms the anterior wall of the oropharynx.\nThe
    average length of the human tongue from the oropharynx to the tip is 10 cm. \n\nThe
    average weight of the human tongue from adult males is 70g and for adult females
    60g.In phonetics and phonology, a distinction is made between the tip of the
    tongue and the blade (the portion just behind the tip). \n\nSounds made with
    the tongue tip are said to be apical, while those made with the tongue blade
    are said to be laminal.\n\n\n==== Upper surface of the tongue ====\n\nThe upper
    surface of the tongue is called the dorsum, and is divided by a groove into symmetrical
    halves by the median sulcus. \n\nThe foramen cecum marks the end of this division
    (at about 2.5 cm from the root of the tongue) and the beginning of the terminal
    sulcus. \n\nThe foramen cecum is also the point of attachment of the thyroglossal
    duct and is formed during the descent of the thyroid diverticulum in embryonic
    development.\nThe terminal sulcus is a shallow groove that runs forward as a
    shallow groove in a V shape from the foramen cecum, forwards and outwards to
    the margins (borders) of the tongue. \n\nThe terminal sulcus divides the tongue
    into a posterior pharyngeal part and an anterior oral part. \n\nThe pharyngeal
    part is supplied by the glossopharyngeal nerve and the oral part is supplied
    by the lingual nerve (a branch of the mandibular branch (V3) of the trigeminal
    nerve) for somatosensory perception and by the chorda tympani (a branch of the
    facial nerve) for taste perception.\nBoth parts of the tongue develop from different
    pharyngeal arches.\n\n\n==== Undersurface of the tongue ====\nOn the undersurface
    of the tongue is a fold of mucous membrane called the frenulum that tethers the
    tongue at the midline to the floor of the mouth. \n\nOn either side of the frenulum
    are small prominences called sublingual caruncles that the major salivary submandibular
    glands drain into.\n\n\n==== Muscles ====\nThe eight muscles of the human tongue
    are classified as either intrinsic or extrinsic. \n\nThe four intrinsic muscles
    act to change the shape of the tongue, and are not attached to any bone. \n\nThe
    four extrinsic muscles act to change the position of the tongue, and are anchored
    to bone.\n\n\n===== Extrinsic =====\n\nThe four extrinsic muscles originate from
    bone and extend to the tongue. \n\nThey are the genioglossus, the hyoglossus
    (often including the chondroglossus) the styloglossus, and the palatoglossus.
    \n\nTheir main functions are altering the tongue's position allowing for protrusion,
    retraction, and side-to-side movement.The genioglossus arises from the mandible
    and protrudes the tongue. \n\nIt is also known as the tongue's \"safety muscle\"
    since it is the only muscle that propels the tongue forward.\nThe hyoglossus,
    arises from the hyoid bone and retracts and depresses the tongue. \n\nThe chondroglossus
    is often included with this muscle.\nThe styloglossus arises from the styloid
    process of the temporal bone and draws the sides of the tongue up to create a
    trough for swallowing.\nThe palatoglossus arises from the palatine aponeurosis,
    and depresses the soft palate, moves the palatoglossal fold towards the midline,
    and elevates the back of the tongue during swallowing.\n\n\n===== Intrinsic =====\n\nFour
    paired intrinsic muscles of the tongue originate and insert within the tongue,
    running along its length. \n\nThey are the superior longitudinal muscle, the
    inferior longitudinal muscle, the vertical muscle, and the transverse muscle.
    \n\nThese muscles alter the shape of the tongue by lengthening and shortening
    it, curling and uncurling its apex and edges as in tongue rolling, and flattening
    and rounding its surface. \n\nThis provides shape and helps facilitate speech,
    swallowing, and eating.The superior longitudinal muscle runs along the upper
    surface of the tongue under the mucous membrane, and elevates, assists in retraction
    of, or deviates the tip of the tongue. \n\nIt originates near the epiglottis,
    at the hyoid bone, from the median fibrous septum.\nThe inferior longitudinal
    muscle lines the sides of the tongue, and is joined to the styloglossus muscle.\nThe
    vertical muscle is located in the middle of the tongue, and joins the superior
    and inferior longitudinal muscles.\nThe transverse muscle divides the tongue
    at the middle, and is attached to the mucous membranes that run along the sides.\n\n\n====
    Blood supply ====\n\nThe tongue receives its blood supply primarily from the
    lingual artery, a branch of the external carotid artery. \n\nThe lingual veins
    drain into the internal jugular vein. \n\nThe floor of the mouth also receives
    its blood supply from the lingual artery. \n\nThere is also a secondary blood
    supply to the root of tongue from the tonsillar branch of the facial artery and
    the ascending pharyngeal artery.\nAn area in the neck sometimes called the Pirogov
    triangle is formed by the intermediate tendon of the digastric muscle, the posterior
    border of the mylohyoid muscle, and the hypoglossal nerve. \n\nThe lingual artery
    is a good place to stop severe hemorrhage from the tongue.\n\n\n==== Nerve supply
    ====\nInnervation of the tongue consists of motor fibers, special sensory fibers
    for taste, and general sensory fibers for sensation.\nMotor supply for all intrinsic
    and extrinsic muscles of the tongue is supplied by efferent motor nerve fibers
    from the hypoglossal nerve (CN XII), with the exception of the palatoglossus,
    which is innervated by the vagus nerve (CN X).Innervation of taste and sensation
    is different for the anterior and posterior part of the tongue because they are
    derived from different embryological structures (pharyngeal arch 1 and pharyngeal
    arches 3 and 4, respectively).\nAnterior two-thirds of tongue (anterior to the
    vallate papillae):\nTaste: chorda tympani branch of the facial nerve (CN VII)
    via special visceral afferent fibers\nSensation: lingual branch of the mandibular
    (V3) division of the trigeminal nerve (CN V) via general visceral afferent fibers\nPosterior
    one third of tongue:\nTaste and sensation: glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX) via
    a mixture of special and general visceral afferent fibers\nBase of tongue\nTaste
    and sensation: internal branch of the superior laryngeal nerve (itself a branch
    of the vagus nerve, CN X)\n\n\n==== Lymphatic drainage ====\nThe tip of tongue
    drains to the submental nodes. \n\nThe left and right halves of the anterior
    two-thirds of the tongue drains to submandibular lymph nodes, while the posterior
    one-third of the tongue drains to the jugulo-omohyoid nodes.\n\n\n==== Microanatomy
    ====\n\nThe upper surface of the tongue is covered in masticatory mucosa, a type
    of oral mucosa which is of keratinized stratified squamous epithelium. \n\nEmbedded
    in this are numerous papillae, some of which house the taste buds and their taste
    receptors. \n\nThe lingual papillae consist of filiform, fungiform, vallate and
    foliate papillae, and only the filiform papillae are not associated with any
    taste buds.\nThe tongue can divide itself in dorsal and ventral surface. \n\nThe
    dorsal surface is a stratified squamous keratinized epithelium which is characterized
    by numerous mucosal projections called papillae. \n\nThe lingual papillae covers
    the dorsal side of the tongue towards the front of the terminal groove. \n\nThe
    ventral surface is stratified squamous non-keratinized epithelium which is smooth.\n\n\n===
    Development ===\n\n\nThe tongue begins to develop in the fourth week of embryonic
    development from a median swelling \u2013 the median tongue bud (tuberculum impar)
    of the first pharyngeal arch.In the fifth week a pair of lateral lingual swellings,
    one on the right side and one on the left, form on the first pharyngeal arch.
    \n\nThese lingual swellings quickly expand and cover the median tongue bud. \n\nThey
    form the anterior part of the tongue that makes up two-thirds of the length of
    the tongue, and continue to develop through prenatal development. \n\nThe line
    of their fusion is marked by the median sulcus.In the fourth week a swelling
    appears from the second pharyngeal arch, in the midline, called the copula. \n\nDuring
    the fifth and sixth weeks the copula is overgrown by a swelling from the third
    and fourth arches (mainly from the third arch) called the hypopharyngeal eminence,
    and this develops into the posterior part of the tongue (the other third). \n\nThe
    hypopharyngeal eminence develops mainly by the growth of endoderm from the third
    pharyngeal arch. \n\nThe boundary between the two parts of the tongue, the anterior
    from the first arch and the posterior from the third arch is marked by the terminal
    sulcus. \n\nThe terminal sulcus is shaped like a V with the tip of the V situated
    posteriorly. \n\nAt the tip of the terminal sulcus is the foramen cecum, which
    is the point of attachment of the thyroglossal duct where the embryonic thyroid
    begins to descend.\n\n\n=== Function ===\n\n\n\n==== Taste ====\n\nChemicals
    that stimulate taste receptor cells are known as tastants. \n\nOnce a tastant
    is dissolved in saliva, it can make contact with the plasma membrane of the gustatory
    hairs, which are the sites of taste transduction.The tongue is equipped with
    many taste buds on its dorsal surface, and each taste bud is equipped with taste
    receptor cells that can sense particular classes of tastes. \n\nDistinct types
    of taste receptor cells respectively detect substances that are sweet, bitter,
    salty, sour, spicy, or taste of umami. \n\nUmami receptor cells are the least
    understood and accordingly are the type most intensively under research.\n\n\n====
    Mastication ====\nThe tongue is an important accessory organ in the digestive
    system. \n\nThe tongue is used for crushing food against the hard palate, during
    mastication and manipulation of food for softening prior to swallowing. \n\nThe
    epithelium on the tongue's upper, or dorsal surface is keratinised. \n\nConsequently,
    the tongue can grind against the hard palate without being itself damaged or
    irritated.\n\n\n==== Speech ====\nThe intrinsic muscles of the tongue enable
    the shaping of the tongue which facilitates speech.\n\n\n==== Intimacy ====\nThe
    tongue plays a role in physical intimacy and sexuality. \n\nThe tongue is part
    of the erogenous zone of the mouth and can be used in intimate contact, as in
    the French kiss and in oral sex. \n\nThe tongue can be used for stimulating the
    clitoris and other areas of the vulva.\n\n\n=== Clinical significance ===\n\n\n\n====
    Disease ====\n\nA congenital disorder of the tongue is that of ankyloglossia
    also known as tongue-tie. \n\nThe tongue is tied to the floor of the mouth by
    a very short and thickened frenulum and this affects speech, eating, and swallowing.\nThe
    tongue is prone to several pathologies including glossitis and other inflammations
    such as geographic tongue, and median rhomboid glossitis; burning mouth syndrome,
    oral hairy leukoplakia, oral candidiasis (thrush), black hairy tongue and fissured
    tongue.\nThere are several types of oral cancer that mainly affect the tongue.
    \n\nMostly these are squamous cell carcinomas.Food debris, desquamated epithelial
    cells and bacteria often form a visible tongue coating. \n\nThis coating has
    been identified as a major factor contributing to bad breath (halitosis), which
    can be managed by using a tongue cleaner.\n\n\n==== Medication delivery ====\nThe
    sublingual region underneath the front of the tongue is an ideal location for
    the administration of certain medications into the body. \n\nThe oral mucosa
    is very thin underneath the tongue, and is underlain by a plexus of veins. \n\nThe
    sublingual route takes advantage of the highly vascular quality of the oral cavity,
    and allows for the speedy application of medication into the cardiovascular system,
    bypassing the gastrointestinal tract. \n\nThis is the only convenient and efficacious
    route of administration (apart from Intravenous therapy) of nitroglycerin to
    a patient suffering chest pain from angina pectoris.\n\n\n== Other animals ==\n\n\nThe
    muscles of the tongue evolved in amphibians from occipital somites. \n\nMost
    amphibians show a proper tongue after their metamorphosis. \n\nAs a consequence
    most vertebrate animals\u2014amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals\u2014have
    tongues (the frog family of pipids lack tongue). \n\nIn mammals such as dogs
    and cats, the tongue is often used to clean the fur and body by licking. \n\nThe
    tongues of these species have a very rough texture which allows them to remove
    oils and parasites. \n\nSome dogs have a tendency to consistently lick a part
    of their foreleg which can result in a skin condition known as a lick granuloma.
    \n\nA dog's tongue also acts as a heat regulator. \n\nAs a dog increases its
    exercise the tongue will increase in size due to greater blood flow. \n\nThe
    tongue hangs out of the dog's mouth and the moisture on the tongue will work
    to cool the bloodflow.Some animals have tongues that are specially adapted for
    catching prey. \n\nFor example, chameleons, frogs, pangolins and anteaters have
    prehensile tongues.\nOther animals may have organs that are analogous to tongues,
    such as a butterfly's proboscis or a radula on a mollusc, but these are not homologous
    with the tongues found in vertebrates and often have little resemblance in function.
    \n\nFor example, butterflies do not lick with their proboscides; they suck through
    them, and the proboscis is not a single organ, but two jaws held together to
    form a tube. \n\nMany species of fish have small folds at the base of their mouths
    that might informally be called tongues, but they lack a muscular structure like
    the true tongues found in most tetrapods.\n\n\n== Society and culture ==\n\n\n\n===
    Figures of speech ===\n\nThe tongue can be used as a metonym for language. \n\nFor
    example, the New Testament of the Bible, in the Book of Acts of the Apostles,
    Jesus' disciples on the Day of Pentecost received a type of spiritual gift: \"there
    appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them.
    \n\nAnd they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other
    tongues ....\", which amazed the crowd of Jewish people in Jerusalem, who were
    from various parts of the Roman Empire but could now understand what was being
    preached. \n\nThe phrase mother tongue is used as a child's first language. \n\nMany
    languages have the same word for \"tongue\" and \"language\".\nA common temporary
    failure in word retrieval from memory is referred to as the tip-of-the-tongue
    phenomenon. \n\nThe expression tongue in cheek refers to a statement that is
    not to be taken entirely seriously \u2013 something said or done with subtle
    ironic or sarcastic humour. \n\nA tongue twister is a phrase made specifically
    to be very difficult to pronounce. \n\nAside from being a medical condition,
    \"tongue-tied\" means being unable to say what you want due to confusion or restriction.
    \n\nThe phrase \"cat got your tongue\" refers to when a person is speechless.
    \n\nTo \"bite one's tongue\" is a phrase which describes holding back an opinion
    to avoid causing offence. \n\nA \"slip of the tongue\" refers to an unintentional
    utterance, such as a Freudian slip. \n\nThe \"gift of tongues\" refers to when
    one is uncommonly gifted to be able to speak in a foreign language, often as
    a type of spiritual gift. \n\nSpeaking in tongues is a common phrase used to
    describe glossolalia, which is to make smooth, language-resembling sounds that
    is no true spoken language itself. \n\nA deceptive person is said to have a forked
    tongue, and a smooth-talking person said to have a silver tongue.\n\n\n=== Gestures
    ===\n\nSticking one's tongue out at someone is considered a childish gesture
    of rudeness or defiance in many countries; the act may also have sexual connotations,
    depending on the way in which it is done. \n\nHowever, in Tibet it is considered
    a greeting. \n\nIn 2009, a farmer from Fabriano, Italy, was convicted and fined
    by the country's highest court for sticking his tongue out at a neighbor with
    whom he had been arguing. \n\nProof of the affront had been captured with a cell
    phone camera.\n\n\n=== Body art ===\n\nTongue piercing and splitting have become
    more common in western countries in recent decades. \n\nIn one study, one-fifth
    of young adults were found to have at least one type of oral piercing, most commonly
    the tongue.\n\n\n=== As food ===\n\n\nThe tongues of some animals are consumed
    and sometimes considered delicacies. \n\nHot tongue sandwiches are frequently
    found on menus in kosher delicatessens in America. \n\nTaco de lengua (lengua
    being Spanish for tongue) is a taco filled with beef tongue, and is especially
    popular in Mexican cuisine. \n\nAs part of Colombian gastronomy, Tongue in Sauce
    (Lengua en Salsa), is a dish prepared by frying the tongue, adding tomato sauce,
    onions and salt. \n\nTongue can also be prepared as birria. \n\nPig and beef
    tongue are consumed in Chinese cuisine. \n\nDuck tongues are sometimes employed
    in Szechuan dishes, while lamb's tongue is occasionally employed in Continental
    and contemporary American cooking. \n\nFried cod \"tongue\" is a relatively common
    part of fish meals in Norway and Newfoundland. \n\nIn Argentina and Uruguay cow
    tongue is cooked and served in vinegar (lengua a la vinagreta). \n\nIn the Czech
    Republic and Poland, a pork tongue is considered a delicacy, and there are many
    ways of preparing it. \n\nIn Eastern Slavic countries, pork and beef tongues
    are commonly consumed, boiled and garnished with horseradish or jelled; beef
    tongues fetch a significantly higher price and are considered more of a delicacy.
    \n\nIn Alaska, cow tongues are among the more common.\nTongues of seals and whales
    have been eaten, sometimes in large quantities, by sealers and whalers, and in
    various times and places have been sold for food on shore.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongue"

  descriptionText: "\n\nDUODENUM\n\n\nThe duodenum is the first section of the small
    intestine in most higher vertebrates, including mammals, reptiles, and birds.
    \n\nIn fish, the divisions of the small intestine are not as clear, and the terms
    anterior intestine or proximal intestine may be used instead of duodenum. \n\nIn
    mammals the duodenum may be the principal site for iron absorption.\nThe duodenum
    precedes the jejunum and ileum and is the shortest part of the small intestine.\nIn
    humans, the duodenum is a hollow jointed tube about 25\u201338 cm (10\u201315
    inches) long connecting the stomach to the jejunum. \n\nIt begins with the duodenal
    bulb and ends at the suspensory muscle of duodenum. \n\nIt can be divided into
    four parts.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe duodenum is a 25\u201338 cm (10-15 inch)
    C-shaped structure lying adjacent to the stomach. \n\nIt is divided anatomically
    into four sections. \n\nThe first part of the duodenum lies within the peritoneum
    but its other parts are retroperitoneal.:\u200A273\u200A\n\n\n=== Parts ===\n\nThe
    first part, or superior part, of the duodenum is a continuation from the pylorus
    to transpyloric plane. \n\nIt is superior to the rest of the segments, at the
    vertebral level of L1. \n\nThe duodenal bulb, about 2 cm (0.79 in) long, is the
    first part of the duodenum and is slightly dilated. \n\nThe duodenal bulb is
    a remnant of the mesoduodenum, a mesentery that suspends the organ from the posterior
    abdominal wall in fetal life. \n\nThe first part of the duodenum is mobile, and
    connected to the liver by the hepatoduodenal ligament of the lesser omentum.
    \n\nThe first part of the duodenum ends at the corner, the superior duodenal
    flexure.:\u200A273\u200ARelations:\nAnterior\nGallbladder\nQuadrate lobe of liver\nPosterior\nBile
    duct\nGastroduodenal artery\nPortal vein\nInferior vena cava\nHead of pancreas\nSuperior\nNeck
    of gallbladder\nHepatoduodenal ligament (lesser omentum)\nInferior\nNeck of pancreas\nGreater
    omentum\nHead of pancreasThe second part, or descending part, of the duodenum
    begins at the superior duodenal flexure. \n\nIt goes inferior to the lower border
    of vertebral body L3, before making a sharp turn medially into the inferior duodenal
    flexure, the end of the descending part.:\u200A274\u200AThe pancreatic duct and
    common bile duct enter the descending duodenum, through the major duodenal papilla.
    \n\nThe second part of the duodenum also contains the minor duodenal papilla,
    the entrance for the accessory pancreatic duct. \n\nThe junction between the
    embryological foregut and midgut lies just below the major duodenal papilla.:\u200A274\u200AThe
    third part, or horizontal part or inferior part of the duodenum is 10~12 cm in
    length. \n\nIt begins at the inferior duodenal flexure and passes transversely
    to the left, passing in front of the inferior vena cava, abdominal aorta and
    the vertebral column. \n\nThe superior mesenteric artery and vein are anterior
    to the third part of duodenum.:\u200A274\u200A This part may be compressed between
    the aorta and SMA causing superior mesenteric artery syndrome.\nThe fourth part,
    or ascending part, of the duodenum passes upward, joining with the jejunum at
    the duodenojejunal flexure. \n\nThe fourth part of the duodenum is at the vertebral
    level L3, and may pass directly on top, or slightly to the left, of the aorta.:\u200A274\u200A\n\n\n===
    Blood supply ===\n\nThe duodenum receives arterial blood from two different sources.
    \n\nThe transition between these sources is important as it demarcates the foregut
    from the midgut. \n\nProximal to the 2nd part of the duodenum (approximately
    at the major duodenal papilla \u2013 where the bile duct enters) the arterial
    supply is from the gastroduodenal artery and its branch the superior pancreaticoduodenal
    artery. \n\nDistal to this point (the midgut) the arterial supply is from the
    superior mesenteric artery (SMA), and its branch the inferior pancreaticoduodenal
    artery supplies the 3rd and 4th sections.\nThe superior and inferior pancreaticoduodenal
    arteries (from the gastroduodenal artery and SMA respectively) form an anastomotic
    loop between the celiac trunk and the SMA; so there is potential for collateral
    circulation here.\nThe venous drainage of the duodenum follows the arteries.
    \n\nUltimately these veins drain into the portal system, either directly or indirectly
    through the splenic or superior mesenteric vein and then to portal vein .\n\n\n===
    Lymphatic drainage ===\n\nThe lymphatic vessels follow the arteries in a retrograde
    fashion. \n\nThe anterior lymphatic vessels drain into the pancreatoduodenal
    lymph nodes located along the superior and inferior pancreatoduodenal arteries
    and then into the pyloric lymph nodes (along the gastroduodenal artery).\nThe
    posterior lymphatic vessels pass posterior to the head of the pancreas and drain
    into the superior mesenteric lymph nodes. \n\nEfferent lymphatic vessels from
    the duodenal lymph nodes ultimately pass into the celiac lymph nodes.\n\n\n===
    Microanatomy ===\n\nUnder microscopy, the duodenum has a villous mucosa. \n\nThis
    is distinct from the mucosa of the pylorus, which directly joins to the duodenum.
    \n\nLike other structures of the gastrointestinal tract, the duodenum has a mucosa,
    submucosa, muscularis externa, and adventitia. \n\nGlands line the duodenum,
    known as Brunner's glands, which secrete mucus and bicarbonate in order to neutralise
    stomach acids. \n\nThese are distinct glands not found in the ileum or jejunum,
    the other parts of the small intestine. :\u200A274\u2013275\u200A\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n===
    Variation ===\n\n\n\n=== Gene and protein expression ===\n\n\nAbout 20,000 protein
    coding genes are expressed in human cells and 70% of these genes are expressed
    in the normal duodenum. \n\nSome 300 of these genes are more specifically expressed
    in the duodenum with very few genes expressed only in the duodenum. \n\nThe corresponding
    specific proteins are expressed in the duodenal mucosa, and many of these are
    also expressed in the small intestine, such as ANPEP, a digestive enzyme, ACE,
    an enzyme involved in control of blood pressure, and RBP2, a protein involved
    in the uptake of vitamin A.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\nThe duodenum is largely responsible
    for the breakdown of food in the small intestine, using enzymes. \n\nThe duodenum
    also regulates the rate of emptying of the stomach via hormonal pathways. \n\nSecretin
    and cholecystokinin are released from cells in the duodenal epithelium in response
    to acidic and fatty stimuli present there when the pylorus opens and emits gastric
    chyme into the duodenum for further digestion. \n\nThese cause the liver and
    gall bladder to release bile, and the pancreas to release bicarbonate and digestive
    enzymes such as trypsin, lipase and amylase into the duodenum as they are needed.\nThe
    villi of the duodenum have a leafy-looking appearance, which is a histologically
    identifiable structure. \n\nBrunner's glands, which secrete mucus, are found
    in the duodenum only. \n\nThe duodenum wall consists of a very thin layer of
    cells that form the muscularis mucosae.\n\n\n== Clinical significance ==\n\n\n\n===
    Ulceration ===\n\n\nUlcers of the duodenum commonly occur because of infection
    by the bacteria Helicobacter pylori. \n\nThese bacteria, through a number of
    mechanisms, erode the protective mucosa of the duodenum, predisposing it to damage
    from gastric acids. \n\nThe first part of the duodenum is the most common location
    of ulcers since it is where the acidic chyme meets the duodenal mucosa before
    mixing with the alkaline secretions of the duodenum. \n\nDuodenal ulcers may
    cause recurrent abdominal pain and dyspepsia, and are often investigated using
    a urea breath test to test for the bacteria, and endoscopy to confirm ulceration
    and take a biopsy. \n\nIf managed, these are often managed through antibiotics
    that aim to eradicate the bacteria, and PPIs and antacids to reduce the gastric
    acidity.\n\n\n=== Celiac disease ===\n\nThe British Society of Gastroenterology
    (BSG) guidelines specify that a duodenal biopsy is required for the diagnosis
    of adult celiac disease. \n\nThe biopsy is ideally performed at a moment when
    the patient is on a gluten-containing diet.\n\n\n=== Cancer ===\n\nDuodenal cancer
    is a cancer in the first section of the small intestine. \n\nCancer of the duodenum
    is relatively rare compared to stomach cancer and colorectal cancer; Malignant
    tumors in the duodenum constitute only around 0.3 % of all the gastrointestinal
    tract tumors but around half of cancerous tissues that develop in the small intestine.
    \n\nIts histology is often observed to be adenocarcinoma, meaning that the cancerous
    tissue arises from glandular cells in the epithelial tissue lining the duodenum.\n\n\n===
    Inflammation ===\n\nInflammation of the duodenum is referred to as duodenitis.
    \n\nThere are multiple known causes.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe name duodenum
    is from Medieval Latin, short for intest\u012Bnum duod\u0113num digit\u014Drum,
    which may be translated: intestine of twelve finger-widths (in length), from
    Latin duod\u0113num, genitive pl. of duod\u0113n\u012B, twelve each, from duodecim,
    twelve. \n\nThe Latin phrase intest\u012Bnum duod\u0113num digit\u014Drum is
    thought to be a loan-translation from the Greek word dodekadaktylon (\u03B4\u03C9\u03B4\u03B5\u03BA\u03B1\u03B4\u03AC\u03BA\u03C4\u03C5\u03BB\u03BF\u03BD),
    literally \"twelve fingers long.\" The intestinal section was so called by Greek
    physician Herophilus (c.335\u2013280 B.C.E.) for its length, about equal to the
    breadth of 12 fingers.\n\n\n== Accessory organs ==\n\nThe liver has so many functions
    but the main digestive function is making bile. \n\nThe gallbladder stores bile
    made from the liver. \n\nIt travels into the duodenum. \n\nThe pancreas makes
    enzymes that break down protein fat and carbohydrates. \n\nThe pancreas also
    makes bicarbonate which neutralizes the acid from the stomach.\n\n\n== Other
    animals ==\n\nThe duodenum is the first section of the small intestine in most
    higher vertebrates, including mammals, reptiles, and birds. \n\nIn fish, the
    divisions of the small intestine are not as clear, and the terms anterior intestine
    or proximal intestine may be used instead of duodenum. \n\nIn mammals the duodenum
    may be the principal site for iron absorption.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duodenum"

  descriptionText: "\n\nURINARY BLADDER\n\n\nThe urinary bladder, or simply bladder,
    is a hollow muscular organ in humans and other vertebrates that stores urine
    from the kidneys before disposal by urination. \n\nIn humans the bladder is a
    hollow distensible organ that sits on the pelvic floor. \n\nUrine enters the
    bladder via the ureters and exits via the urethra. \n\nThe typical human bladder
    will hold between 300 and 500 ml before the urge to empty occurs, but can hold
    considerably more.\n\nThe Latin phrase for \"urinary bladder\" is vesica urinaria,
    and the term vesical or prefix vesico - appear in connection with associated
    structures such as vesical veins. \n\nThe modern Latin word for \"bladder\" \u2013
    cystis \u2013 appears in associated terms such as cystitis (inflammation of the
    bladder).\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\n\nIn humans, the bladder is a hollow muscular
    organ situated at the base of the pelvis. \n\nIn gross anatomy, the bladder can
    be divided into a broad fundus, a body, an apex, and a neck. \n\nThe apex is
    directed forward toward the upper part of the pubic symphysis, and from there
    the median umbilical ligament continues upward on the back of the anterior abdominal
    wall to the umbilicus. \n\nThe peritoneum is carried by it from the apex on to
    the abdominal wall to form the middle umbilical fold. \n\nThe neck of the bladder
    is the area at the base of the trigone that surrounds the internal urethral orifice
    that leads to the urethra. \n\nIn males the neck of the urinary bladder is next
    to the prostate gland.\nThe bladder has three openings. \n\nThe two ureters enter
    the bladder at ureteric orifices, and the urethra enters at the trigone of the
    bladder. \n\nThese ureteric openings have mucosal flaps in front of them that
    act as valves in preventing the backflow of urine into the ureters, known as
    vesicoureteral reflux. \n\nBetween the two ureteric openings is a raised area
    of tissue called the interureteric crest. \n\nThis makes the upper boundary of
    the trigone. \n\nThe trigone is an area of smooth muscle that forms the floor
    of the bladder above the urethra. \n\nIt is an area of smooth tissue for the
    easy flow of urine into and from this part of the bladder - in contrast to the
    irregular surface formed by the rugae.\n\nThe walls of the bladder have a series
    of ridges, thick mucosal folds known as rugae that allow for the expansion of
    the bladder. \n\nThe detrusor muscle is the muscular layer of the wall made of
    smooth muscle fibers arranged in spiral, longitudinal, and circular bundles.
    \n\nThe detrusor muscle is able to change its length. \n\nIt can also contract
    for a long time whilst voiding, and it stays relaxed whilst the bladder is filling.
    \n\nThe wall of the urinary bladder is normally 3\u20135 mm thick. \n\nWhen well
    distended, the wall is normally less than 3 mm.\n\n\n=== Nearby structures ===\n\n\nIn
    men, the prostate gland lies outside the opening for the urethra. \n\nThe middle
    lobe of the prostate causes an elevation in the mucous membrane behind the internal
    urethral orifice called the uvula of urinary bladder. \n\nThe uvula can enlarge
    when the prostate becomes enlarged.\nThe bladder is located below the peritoneal
    cavity near the pelvic floor and behind the pubic symphysis. \n\nIn men, it lies
    in front of the rectum, separated by the recto-vesical pouch, and is supported
    by fibres of the levator ani and of the prostate gland. \n\nIn women, it lies
    in front of the uterus, separated by the vesico-uterine pouch, and is supported
    by the elevator ani and the upper part of the vagina.\n\n\n=== Blood and lymph
    supply ===\n\nThe bladder receives blood by the vesical arteries and drained
    into a network of vesical veins. \n\nThe superior vesical artery supplies blood
    to the upper part of the bladder. \n\nThe lower part of the bladder is supplied
    by the inferior vesical artery, both of which are branches of the internal iliac
    arteries. \n\nIn females, the uterine and vaginal arteries provide additional
    blood supply. \n\nVenous drainage begins in a network of small vessels on the
    lower lateral surfaces of the bladder, which coalesce and travel with the lateral
    ligaments of the bladder into the internal iliac veins.\n\nThe lymph drained
    from the bladder begins in a series of networks throughout the mucosal, muscular
    and serosal layers. \n\nThese then form three sets of vessels: one set near the
    trigone draining the bottom of the bladder; one set draining the top of the bladder;
    and another set draining the outer undersurface of the bladder. \n\nThe majority
    of these vessels drain into the external iliac lymph nodes.\n\n\n=== Nerve supply
    ===\n\nThe bladder receives both sensory and motor supply from sympathetic and
    the parasympathetic nervous systems. \n\nThe motor supply from both sympathetic
    fibers, most of which arise from the superior and inferior hypogastric plexuses
    and nerves, and from parasympathetic fibers, which come from the pelvic splanchnic
    nerves.Sensation from the bladder, relating to distension or to irritation (such
    as by infection or a stone) is transmitted primarily through the parasympathetic
    nervous system. \n\nThese travel via sacral nerves to S2-4. \n\nFrom here, sensation
    travels to the brain via the dorsal columns in the spinal cord.\n\n\n=== Microanatomy
    ===\n\nWhen viewed under a microscope the bladder can be seen to have an inner
    lining (called epithelium), three layers of muscle fibres, and an outer adventitia.\n\nThe
    inner wall of the bladder is called urothelium, a type of transitional epithelium
    formed by three to six layers of cells; the cells may become more cuboidal or
    flatter depending on whether the bladder is empty or full. \n\nAdditionally,
    these are lined with a mucous membrane consisting of a surface glycocalyx that
    protects the cells beneath it from urine. \n\nThe epithelium lies on a thin basement
    membrane, and a lamina propria. \n\nThe mucosal lining also offers a urothelial
    barrier against the passing of infections.\n\nThese layers are surrounded by
    three layers of muscle fibres arranged as an inner layer of fibres orientated
    longitudinally, a middle layer of circular fibres, and an outermost layer of
    longitudinal fibres; these form the detrusor muscle, which can be seen with the
    naked eye.The outside of the bladder is protected by a serous membrane called
    adventitia.\n\n\n\n=== Development ===\n\n\nIn the developing embryo, at the
    hind end lies a cloaca. \n\nThis, over the fourth to the seventh week, divides
    into a urogenital sinus and the beginnings of the anal canal, with a wall forming
    between these two inpouchings called the urorectal septum. \n\nThe urogenital
    sinus divides into three parts, with the upper and largest part becoming the
    bladder; the middle part becoming the urethra, and the lower part changes depending
    on the biological sex of the embryo.The human urinary bladder derives from the
    urogenital sinus, and it is initially continuous with the allantois. \n\nThe
    upper and lower parts of the bladder develop separately and join together around
    the middle part of development. \n\nAt this time the ureters move from the mesonephric
    ducts to the trigone. \n\nIn males, the base of the bladder lies between the
    rectum and the pubic symphysis. \n\nIt is superior to the prostate, and separated
    from the rectum by the recto-vesical pouch. \n\nIn females, the bladder sits
    inferior to the uterus and anterior to the vagina; thus its maximum capacity
    is lower than in males. \n\nIt is separated from the uterus by the vesico-uterine
    pouch. \n\nIn infants and young children the urinary bladder is in the abdomen
    even when empty.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\n\nUrine, excreted by the kidneys, collects
    in the bladder because of drainage from two ureters, before disposal by urination
    (micturition). \n\nUrine leaves the bladder via the urethra, a single muscular
    tube ending in an opening called the urinary meatus, where it exits the body.
    \n\nUrination involves coordinated muscle changes involving a reflex based in
    the spine, with higher inputs from the brain. \n\nDuring urination, the detrusor
    muscle contracts, and the external urinary sphincter and muscles of the perineum
    relax, allowing urine to pass through the urethra and out of the body.\n\nThe
    urge to pass urine stems from stretch receptors that activate when between 300
    - 400 mL urine is held within the bladder. \n\nAs urine accumulates, the rugae
    flatten and the wall of the bladder thins as it stretches, allowing the bladder
    to store larger amounts of urine without a significant rise in internal pressure.
    \n\nUrination is controlled by the pontine micturition center in the brainstem.Stretch
    receptors in the bladder signal the parasympathetic nervous system to stimulate
    the muscarinic receptors in the detrusor to contract the muscle when the bladder
    is distended. \n\nThis encourages the bladder to expel urine through the urethra.
    \n\nThe main receptor activated is the M3 receptor, although M2 receptors are
    also involved and whilst outnumbering the M3 receptors they are not so responsive.\n\nThe
    main relaxant pathway is via the adenylyl cyclase cAMP pathway, activated via
    the \u03B23 adrenergic receptors. \n\nThe \u03B22 adrenergic receptors are also
    present in the detrusor and even outnumber \u03B23 receptors, but they do not
    have as important an effect in relaxing the detrusor smooth muscle.\n\n\n== Clinical
    significance ==\n\n\n=== Inflammation and infection ===\n\n\nCystitis refers
    to infection or inflammation of the bladder. \n\nIt commonly occurs as part of
    a urinary tract infection. \n\nIn adults, it is more common in women than men,
    owing to a shorter urethra. \n\nIt is common in males during childhood, and in
    older men where an enlarged prostate may cause urinary retention. \n\nOther risk
    factors include other causes of blockage or narrowing, such as prostate cancer
    or the presence of vesico-ureteric reflux; the presence of outside structures
    in the urinary tract, such as urinary catheters; and neurologic problems that
    make passing urine difficult. \n\nInfections that involve the bladder can cause
    pain in the lower abdomen (above the pubic symphysis, so called \"suprapubic\"
    pain), particularly before and after passing urine, and a desire to pass urine
    frequently and with little warning (urinary urgency). \n\nInfections are usually
    due to bacteria, of which the most common is E coli.When a urinary tract infection
    or cystitis is suspected, a medical practitioner may request a urine sample.
    \n\nA dipstick placed in the urine may be used to see if the urine has white
    blood cells, or the presence of nitrates which may indicate an infection. \n\nThe
    urine specimen may be also sent for microbial culture and sensitivity to assess
    if a particular bacteria grows in the urine, and identify its antibiotic sensitivities.
    \n\nSometimes, additional investigations may be requested. \n\nThese might include
    testing the function of the kidneys by assessing electrolytes and creatinine;
    investigating for blockages or narrowing of the renal tract with a ultrasound,
    and testing for an enlarged prostate with a digital rectal examination.\n\nUrinary
    tract infections or cystitis are treated with antibiotics, many of which are
    consumed by mouth. \n\nSerious infections may require treatment with intravenous
    antibiotics.Interstitial cystitis refers to a condition in which the bladder
    is infected due to a cause that is not bacteria.\n\n\n=== Incontinence and retention
    ===\n\nFrequent urination can be due to excessive urine production, small bladder
    capacity, irritability or incomplete emptying. \n\nMales with an enlarged prostate
    urinate more frequently. \n\nOne definition of an overactive bladder is when
    a person urinates more than eight times per day. \n\nAn overactive bladder can
    often cause urinary incontinence. \n\nThough both urinary frequency and volumes
    have been shown to have a circadian rhythm, meaning day and night cycles, it
    is not entirely clear how these are disturbed in the overactive bladder. \n\nUrodynamic
    testing can help to explain the symptoms. \n\nAn underactive bladder is the condition
    where there is a difficulty in passing urine and is the main symptom of a neurogenic
    bladder. \n\nFrequent urination at night may indicate the presence of bladder
    stones.\nDisorders of or related to the bladder include:\n\nBladder exstrophy\nBladder
    sphincter dyssynergia, a condition in which the sufferer cannot coordinate relaxation
    of the urethra sphincter with the contraction of the bladder muscles\nParuresis\nTrigonitis\nUrinary
    retention\n\nDisorders of bladder function may be dealt with surgically, by re-directing
    the flow of urine or by replacement with an artificial urinary bladder. \n\nThe
    volume of the bladder may be increased by bladder augmentation. \n\nAn obstruction
    of the bladder neck may be severe enough to warrant surgery.\n\n\n=== Cancer
    ===\n\n\nCancer of the bladder is known as bladder cancer. \n\nIt is usually
    due to cancer of the urothelium, the cells that line the surface of the bladder.
    \n\nBladder cancer is more common after the age of 40, and more common in men
    than women; other risk factors include smoking and exposure to dyes such as aromatic
    amines and aldehydes. \n\nWhen cancer is present, the most common symptom in
    an affected person is blood in the urine; a physical medical examination may
    be otherwise normal, except in late disease. \n\nBladder cancer is most often
    due to cancer of the cells lining the ureter, called transitional cell carcinoma,
    although it can more rarely occur as a squamous cell carcinoma if the type of
    cells lining the urethra have changed due to chronic inflammation, such as due
    to stones or schistosomiasis.\n\nInvestigations performed usually include collecting
    a sample of urine for an inspection for malignant cells under a microscope, called
    cytology, as well as medical imaging by a CT urogram or ultrasound. \n\nIf a
    concerning lesion is seen, a flexible camera may be inserted into the bladder,
    called cystoscopy, in order to view the lesion and take a biopsy, and a CT scan
    will be performed of other body parts (a CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis)
    to look for additional metastatic lesions.Treatment depends on the cancer's stage.
    \n\nCancer present only in the bladder may be removed surgically via cystoscopy;
    an injection of the chemotherapeutic mitomycin C may be performed at the same
    time. \n\nCancers that are high grade may be treated with an injection of the
    BCG vaccine into the bladder wall, and may require surgical removal if it does
    not resolve. \n\nCancer that is invading through the bladder wall may be managed
    by complete surgical removal of the bladder (radical cystectomy), with the ureters
    diverted into a segment of part of ileum connected to a stoma bag on the skin.
    \n\nPrognosis can vary markedly depending on the cancer's stage and grade, with
    a better prognosis associated with tumours found only in the bladder, that are
    low grade, that don't invade through the bladder wall, and that is papillary
    in visual appearance.\n\n\n=== Investigation ===\n\n\nA number of investigations
    are used to examine the bladder. \n\nThe investigations that are ordered will
    depend on the taking of a medical history and an examination. \n\nThe examination
    may involve a medical practitioner feeling in the suprapubic area for tenderness
    or fullness that might indicate an inflamed or full bladder. \n\nBlood tests
    may be ordered that may indicate inflammation; for example a full blood count
    may demonstrate elevated white blood cells, or a C-reactive protein may be elevated
    in an infection.Some forms of medical imaging exist to visualise the bladder.
    \n\nA bladder ultrasound may be conducted to view how much urine is within the
    bladder, indicating urinary retention. \n\nA urinary tract ultrasound, conducted
    by a more trained operator, may be conducted to view whether there are stones,
    tumours or sites of obstruction within the bladder and urinary tract. \n\nA CT
    scan may also be ordered.\nA flexible internal camera, called a cystoscope, can
    be inserted to view the internal appearance of the bladder and take a biopsy
    if required.\nUrodynamic testing can help to explain the symptoms.\n\n\n== Other
    animals ==\n\n\n=== Mammals ===\n\nAll mammals have a urinary bladder. \n\nThis
    structure begins as an embryonic cloaca. \n\nIn the vast majority, this eventually
    becomes differentiated into a dorsal part connected to the intestine and a ventral
    part which becomes associated with the urinogenital passage and urinary bladder.
    \n\nThe only mammals in which this does not take place are the platypus and the
    spiny anteater both of which retain the cloaca into adulthood.The mammalian bladder
    is an organ that regularly stores a hyperosmotic concentration of urine. \n\nIt
    therefore is relatively impermeable and has multiple epithelial layers. \n\nThe
    urinary bladder of the cetaceans (whales and dolphins) is proportionally smaller
    than that of land-dwelling mammals.\n\n\n=== Reptiles ===\n\nIn all reptiles,
    the urinogenital ducts and the anus both empty into an organ called a cloaca.
    \n\nIn some reptiles, a midventral wall in the cloaca may open into a urinary
    bladder, but not all. \n\nIt is present in all turtles and tortoises as well
    as most lizards but is lacking in the monitor lizard, the legless lizards. \n\nIt
    is absent in the snakes, alligators, and crocodiles.:\u200Ap. 474\u200AMany turtles,
    tortoises, and lizards have proportionally very large bladders. \n\nCharles Darwin
    noted that the Galapagos tortoise had a bladder which could store up to 20% of
    its body weight. \n\nSuch adaptations are the result of environments such as
    remote islands and deserts where water is very scarce. \n\nOther desert-dwelling
    reptiles have large bladders that can store a long-term reservoir of water for
    up to several months and aid in osmoregulation.\n\nTurtles have two or more accessory
    urinary bladders, located lateral to the neck of the urinary bladder and dorsal
    to the pubis, occupying a significant portion of their body cavity. \n\nTheir
    bladder is also usually bilobed with a left and right section. \n\nThe right
    section is located under the liver, which prevents large stones from remaining
    in that side while the left section is more likely to have calculi.\n\n\n===
    Amphibians ===\n\nMost aquatic and semi-aquatic amphibians have a membranous
    skin which allows them to absorb water directly through it. \n\nSome semi-aquatic
    animals also have similarly permeable bladder membrane. \n\nAs a result, they
    tend to have high rates of urine production to offset this high water intake,
    and have urine which is low in dissolved salts. \n\nThe urinary bladder assists
    such animals to retain salts. \n\nSome aquatic amphibian such as Xenopus do not
    reabsorb water, to prevent excessive water influx. \n\nFor land-dwelling amphibians,
    dehydration results in reduced urine output.The amphibian bladder is usually
    highly distensible and among some land-dwelling species of frogs and salamanders
    may account for between 20% and 50% of their total body weight.\n\n\n=== Fish
    ===\n\nThe gills of most teleost fish help to eliminate ammonia from the body,
    and fish live surrounded by water, but most still have a distinct bladder for
    storing waste fluid. \n\nThe urinary bladder of teleosts is permeable to water,
    though this is less true for freshwater dwelling species than saltwater species.\n\nMost
    fish also have an organ called a swim-bladder which is unrelated to the urinary
    bladder except in its membranous nature. \n\nThe loaches, pilchards, and herrings
    are among the few types of fish in which a urinary bladder is poorly developed.
    \n\nIt is largest in those fish which lack an air bladder, and is situated in
    front of the oviducts and behind the rectum.\n\n\n=== Birds ===\n\n\nIn nearly
    all bird species, there is no urinary bladder per se. \n\nAlthough all birds
    have kidneys, the ureters open directly into a cloaca which serves as a reservoir
    for urine, fecal matter, and eggs.\n\n\n=== Crustaceans ===\n\nUnlike the urinary
    bladder of vertebrates, the urinary bladder of crustaceans both stores and modifies
    urine. \n\nThe bladder consists of two sets of lateral and central lobes. \n\nThe
    central lobes sit near the digestive organs and the lateral lobes extend along
    the front and sides of the crustacean's body cavity. \n\nThe tissue of the bladder
    is thin epithelium.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"

  descriptionText: "\n\nCORPUS SPONGIOSUM OF PENIS\n\n\nThe corpus spongiosum is
    the mass of spongy tissue surrounding the male urethra within the penis. \n\nIt
    is also called the corpus cavernosum urethrae in older texts.\n\n\n== Anatomy
    ==\n\nPosterior part of the corpus spongiosum is expanded to form the urethral
    bulb, and lies in apposition with the inferior fascia of the urogenital diaphragm,
    from which it receives a fibrous investment.\n\nThe urethra enters the bulb nearer
    to the superior than to the inferior surface. \n\nOn the latter there is a median
    sulcus (groove), from which a thin fibrous septum (wall) projects into the substance
    of the bulb and divides it imperfectly into two lateral lobes or hemispheres.\n\nThe
    portion of the corpus spongiosum in front of the bulb lies in a groove on the
    under surface of the conjoined corpora cavernosa penis. \n\nIt is cylindrical
    in form and tapers slightly from behind forward. \n\nIts anterior end is expanded
    in the form of an obtuse cone, flattened from above downward. \n\nThis expansion,
    termed the glans penis, is moulded on the rounded ends of the corpus cavernosum
    penis, extending farther on their upper than on their lower surfaces.\n\nAt the
    summit of the glans is the slit-like vertical opening known as the external urethral
    orifice, or the urinary meatus.\n\nThe circumference of the base of the glans
    forms a rounded projecting border, the corona of glans penis, overhanging a deep
    retroglandular sulcus, behind which is the neck of the penis.\n\n\n== Function
    ==\n\nThe function of the corpus spongiosum in erection is to prevent the urethra
    from pinching closed, thereby maintaining the urethra as a viable channel for
    ejaculation. \n\nTo do this, the corpus spongiosum remains pliable during erection
    while the corpora cavernosa penis become engorged with blood.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpus_spongiosum_penis"

  descriptionText: "\n\nSIGMOID COLON\n\n\nThe sigmoid colon (or pelvic colon) is
    the part of the large intestine that is closest to the rectum and anus. \n\nIt
    forms a loop that averages about 35\u201340 centimetres (14\u201316 in) in length.
    \n\nThe loop is typically shaped like a Greek letter sigma (\u03C2) or Latin
    letter S (thus sigma + -oid). \n\nThis part of the colon normally lies within
    the pelvis, but due to its freedom of movement it is liable to be displaced into
    the abdominal cavity.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe sigmoid colon begins at the
    superior aperture of the lesser pelvis, where it is continuous with the iliac
    colon, and passes transversely across the front of the sacrum to the right side
    of the pelvis.\n\nIt then curves on itself and turns toward the left to reach
    the middle line at the level of the third piece of the sacrum, where it bends
    downward and ends in the rectum.\n\nIts function is to expel solid and gaseous
    waste from the gastrointestinal tract. \n\nThe curving path it takes toward the
    anus allows it to store gas in the superior arched portion, enabling the colon
    to expel gas without excreting faeces simultaneously.\n\n\n=== Coverings ===\n\nThe
    sigmoid colon is completely surrounded by peritoneum (and thus is not retroperitoneal),
    which forms a mesentery (sigmoid mesocolon), which diminishes in length from
    the center toward the ends of the loop, where it disappears, so that the loop
    is fixed at its junctions with the iliac colon and rectum, but enjoys a considerable
    range of movement in its central portion.\n\n\n=== Nerve supply ===\n\nPelvic
    splanchnic nerves are the primary source for parasympathetic innervation. \n\nLumbar
    splanchnic nerves provide sympathetic innervation via the inferior mesenteric
    ganglion.\n\n\n=== Relations ===\n\nBehind the sigmoid colon are the external
    iliac vessels, ovary, obturator nerve, the left Piriformis, and left sacral plexus
    of nerves.\n\nIn front, it is separated from the bladder in the male, and the
    uterus in the female, by some coils of the small intestine.\n\n\n== Clinical
    significance ==\n\nDiverticulosis often occurs in the sigmoid colon in association
    with increased intraluminal pressure and focal weakness in the colonic wall.
    \n\nIt is a common cause of hematochezia.\nVolvulus occurs when a portion of
    the bowel twists around its mesentery, which can lead to obstruction and infarction.
    \n\nVolvulus in the elderly commonly occurs in the sigmoid colon, whereas in
    infants and children it is more likely to occur in the midgut. \n\nThis may correct
    itself spontaneously or the rotation may continue until the blood supply of the
    gut is cut off completely.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_colon"

    or non-functional.\n\nIt may open separately into the second part of the duodenum,

  descriptionText: "\n\nKIDNEY\n\n\nThe kidneys are two reddish-brown bean-shaped
    organs found in vertebrates. \n\nThey are located on the left and right in the
    retroperitoneal space, and in adult humans are about 12 centimetres (4+1\u20442
    inches) in length. \n\nThey receive blood from the paired renal arteries; blood
    exits into the paired renal veins. \n\nEach kidney is attached to a ureter, a
    tube that carries excreted urine to the bladder.\n\nThe kidney participates in
    the control of the volume of various body fluids, fluid osmolality, acid\u2013base
    balance, various electrolyte concentrations, and removal of toxins. \n\nFiltration
    occurs in the glomerulus: one-fifth of the blood volume that enters the kidneys
    is filtered. \n\nExamples of substances reabsorbed are solute-free water, sodium,
    bicarbonate, glucose, and amino acids. \n\nExamples of substances secreted are
    hydrogen, ammonium, potassium and uric acid. \n\nThe kidneys also carry out functions
    independent of the nephron. \n\nFor example, they convert a precursor of vitamin
    D to its active form, calcitriol; and synthesize the hormones erythropoietin
    and renin. \n\nThe nephron is the structural and functional unit of the kidney.
    \n\nEach adult human kidney contains around 1 million nephrons, while a mouse
    kidney contains only about 12,500 nephrons.\n\nProcedures used in the management
    of kidney disease include chemical and microscopic examination of the urine (urinalysis),
    measurement of kidney function by calculating the estimated glomerular filtration
    rate (eGFR) using the serum creatinine; and kidney biopsy and CT scan to evaluate
    for abnormal anatomy. \n\nDialysis and kidney transplantation are used to treat
    kidney failure; one (or both sequentially) of these are almost always used when
    renal function drops below 15%. \n\nNephrectomy is frequently used to cure renal
    cell carcinoma.\nRenal physiology is the study of kidney function. \n\nNephrology
    is the medical specialty which addresses diseases of kidney function: these include
    chronic kidney disease, nephritic and nephrotic syndromes, acute kidney injury,
    and pyelonephritis. \n\nUrology addresses diseases of kidney (and urinary tract)
    anatomy: these include cancer, renal cysts, kidney stones and ureteral stones,
    and urinary tract obstruction. \n\nThe word \u201Crenal\u201D is an adjective
    meaning \u201Crelating to the kidneys\u201D, and its roots are French or late
    Latin. \n\nWhereas according to some opinions, \"renal\" should be replaced with
    \"kidney\" in scientific writings such as \"kidney artery\", other experts have
    advocated preserving the use of renal as appropriate including in \"renal artery\".\n\n\n==
    Structure ==\n\n\nIn humans, the kidneys are located high in the abdominal cavity,
    one on each side of the spine, and lie in a retroperitoneal position at a slightly
    oblique angle. \n\nThe asymmetry within the abdominal cavity, caused by the position
    of the liver, typically results in the right kidney being slightly lower and
    smaller than the left, and being placed slightly more to the middle than the
    left kidney. \n\nThe left kidney is approximately at the vertebral level T12
    to L3, and the right is slightly lower. \n\nThe right kidney sits just below
    the diaphragm and posterior to the liver. \n\nThe left kidney sits below the
    diaphragm and posterior to the spleen. \n\nOn top of each kidney is an adrenal
    gland. \n\nThe upper parts of the kidneys are partially protected by the 11th
    and 12th ribs. \n\nEach kidney, with its adrenal gland is surrounded by two layers
    of fat: the perirenal fat present between renal fascia and renal capsule and
    pararenal fat superior to the renal fascia.\n\nThe kidney is a bean-shaped structure
    with a convex and a concave border. \n\nA recessed area on the concave border
    is the renal hilum, where the renal artery enters the kidney and the renal vein
    and ureter leave. \n\nThe kidney is surrounded by tough fibrous tissue, the renal
    capsule, which is itself surrounded by perirenal fat, renal fascia, and pararenal
    fat. \n\nThe anterior (front) surface of these tissues is the peritoneum, while
    the posterior (rear) surface is the transversalis fascia.\n\nThe superior pole
    of the right kidney is adjacent to the liver. \n\nFor the left kidney, it is
    next to the spleen. \n\nBoth, therefore, move down upon inhalation.\n\nA Danish
    study measured the median renal length to be 11.2 cm (4+7\u204416 in) on the
    left side and 10.9 cm (4+5\u204416 in) on the right side in adults. \n\nMedian
    renal volumes were 146 cm3 (8+15\u204416 cu in) on the left and 134 cm3 (8+3\u204416
    cu in) on the right.\n\n\n=== Gross anatomy ===\n\n\nThe functional substance,
    or parenchyma, of the kidney is divided into two major structures: the outer
    renal cortex and the inner renal medulla. \n\nGrossly, these structures take
    the shape of eight to 18 cone-shaped renal lobes, each containing renal cortex
    surrounding a portion of medulla called a renal pyramid. \n\nBetween the renal
    pyramids are projections of cortex called renal columns. \n\nNephrons, the urine-producing
    functional structures of the kidney, span the cortex and medulla. \n\nThe initial
    filtering portion of a nephron is the renal corpuscle, which is located in the
    cortex. \n\nThis is followed by a renal tubule that passes from the cortex deep
    into the medullary pyramids. \n\nPart of the renal cortex, a medullary ray is
    a collection of renal tubules that drain into a single collecting duct.\n\nThe
    tip, or papilla, of each pyramid empties urine into a minor calyx; minor calyces
    empty into major calyces, and major calyces empty into the renal pelvis. \n\nThis
    becomes the ureter. \n\nAt the hilum, the ureter and renal vein exit the kidney
    and the renal artery enters. \n\nHilar fat and lymphatic tissue with lymph nodes
    surround these structures. \n\nThe hilar fat is contiguous with a fat-filled
    cavity called the renal sinus. \n\nThe renal sinus collectively contains the
    renal pelvis and calyces and separates these structures from the renal medullary
    tissue.The kidneys possess no overtly moving structures.\n\n\n\n=== Blood supply
    ===\n\n\nThe kidneys receive blood from the renal arteries, left and right, which
    branch directly from the abdominal aorta. \n\nDespite their relatively small
    size, the kidneys receive approximately 20% of the cardiac output. \n\nEach renal
    artery branches into segmental arteries, dividing further into interlobar arteries,
    which penetrate the renal capsule and extend through the renal columns between
    the renal pyramids. \n\nThe interlobar arteries then supply blood to the arcuate
    arteries that run through the boundary of the cortex and the medulla. \n\nEach
    arcuate artery supplies several interlobular arteries that feed into the afferent
    arterioles that supply the glomeruli.\n\nBlood drains from the kidneys, ultimately
    into the inferior vena cava. \n\nAfter filtration occurs, the blood moves through
    a small network of small veins (venules) that converge into interlobular veins.
    \n\nAs with the arteriole distribution, the veins follow the same pattern: the
    interlobular provide blood to the arcuate veins then back to the interlobar veins,
    which come to form the renal veins which exiting the kidney .\n\n\n=== Nerve
    supply ===\n\nThe kidney and nervous system communicate via the renal plexus,
    whose fibers course along the renal arteries to reach each kidney. \n\nInput
    from the sympathetic nervous system triggers vasoconstriction in the kidney,
    thereby reducing renal blood flow. \n\nThe kidney also receives input from the
    parasympathetic nervous system, by way of the renal branches of the vagus nerve;
    the function of this is yet unclear. \n\nSensory input from the kidney travels
    to the T10-11 levels of the spinal cord and is sensed in the corresponding dermatome.
    \n\nThus, pain in the flank region may be referred from corresponding kidney.\n\n\n===
    Microanatomy ===\n\nRenal histology is the study of the microscopic structure
    of the kidney. \n\nDistinct cell types include:\n\nKidney glomerulus parietal
    cell\nKidney glomerulus podocyte\nKidney proximal tubule brush border cell\nLoop
    of Henle thin segment cell\nThick ascending limb cell\nKidney distal tubule cell\nCollecting
    duct principal cell\nCollecting duct intercalated cell\nInterstitial kidney cells\n\n\n===
    Gene and protein expression ===\n\n\nAbout 20,000 protein coding genes are expressed
    in human cells and almost 70% of these genes are expressed in normal, adult kidneys.
    \n\nJust over 300 genes are more specifically expressed in the kidney, with only
    some 50 genes being highly specific for the kidney. \n\nMany of the corresponding
    kidney specific proteins are expressed in the cell membrane and function as transporter
    proteins. \n\nThe highest expressed kidney specific protein is uromodulin, the
    most abundant protein in urine with functions that prevent calcification and
    growth of bacteria. \n\nSpecific proteins are expressed in the different compartments
    of the kidney with podocin and nephrin expressed in glomeruli, Solute carrier
    family protein SLC22A8 expressed in proximal tubules, calbindin expressed in
    distal tubules and aquaporin 2 expressed in the collecting duct cells.\n\n\n===
    Development ===\n\n\nThe mammalian kidney develops from intermediate mesoderm.
    \n\nKidney development, also called nephrogenesis, proceeds through a series
    of three successive developmental phases: the pronephros, mesonephros, and metanephros.
    \n\nThe metanephros are primordia of the permanent kidney.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\n\nThe
    kidneys excrete a variety of waste products produced by metabolism into the urine.
    \n\nThe microscopic structural and functional unit of the kidney is the nephron.
    \n\nIt processes the blood supplied to it via filtration, reabsorption, secretion
    and excretion; the consequence of those processes is the production of urine.
    \n\nThese include the nitrogenous wastes urea, from protein catabolism, and uric
    acid, from nucleic acid metabolism. \n\nThe ability of mammals and some birds
    to concentrate wastes into a volume of urine much smaller than the volume of
    blood from which the wastes were extracted is dependent on an elaborate countercurrent
    multiplication mechanism. \n\nThis requires several independent nephron characteristics
    to operate: a tight hairpin configuration of the tubules, water and ion permeability
    in the descending limb of the loop, water impermeability in the ascending loop,
    and active ion transport out of most of the ascending limb. \n\nIn addition,
    passive countercurrent exchange by the vessels carrying the blood supply to the
    nephron is essential for enabling this function.\n\nThe kidney participates in
    whole-body homeostasis, regulating acid\u2013base balance, electrolyte concentrations,
    extracellular fluid volume, and blood pressure. \n\nThe kidney accomplishes these
    homeostatic functions both independently and in concert with other organs, particularly
    those of the endocrine system. \n\nVarious endocrine hormones coordinate these
    endocrine functions; these include renin, angiotensin II, aldosterone, antidiuretic
    hormone, and atrial natriuretic peptide, among others.\n\n\n=== Formation of
    urine ===\n\n\n\n==== Filtration ====\n\nFiltration, which takes place at the
    renal corpuscle, is the process by which cells and large proteins are retained
    while materials of smaller molecular weights are filtered from the blood to make
    an ultrafiltrate that eventually becomes urine. \n\nThe kidney generates 180
    liters of filtrate a day. \n\nThe process is also known as hydrostatic filtration
    due to the hydrostatic pressure exerted on the capillary walls.\n\n\n==== Reabsorption
    ====\n\nReabsorption is the transport of molecules from this ultrafiltrate and
    into the peritubular capillary. \n\nIt is accomplished via selective receptors
    on the luminal cell membrane. \n\nWater is 55% reabsorbed in the proximal tubule.
    \n\nGlucose at normal plasma levels is completely reabsorbed in the proximal
    tubule. \n\nThe mechanism for this is the Na+/glucose cotransporter. \n\nA plasma
    level of 350 mg/dL will fully saturate the transporters and glucose will be lost
    in the urine. \n\nA plasma glucose level of approximately 160 is sufficient to
    allow glucosuria, which is an important clinical clue to diabetes mellitus.\nAmino
    acids are reabsorbed by sodium dependent transporters in the proximal tubule.
    \n\nHartnup disease is a deficiency of the tryptophan amino acid transporter,
    which results in pellagra.\n\n\n==== Secretion ====\n\nSecretion is the reverse
    of reabsorption: molecules are transported from the peritubular capillary through
    the interstitial fluid, then through the renal tubular cell and into the ultrafiltrate.\n\n\n====
    Excretion ====\n\nThe last step in the processing of the ultrafiltrate is excretion:
    the ultrafiltrate passes out of the nephron and travels through a tube called
    the collecting duct, which is part of the collecting duct system, and then to
    the ureters where it is renamed urine. \n\nIn addition to transporting the ultrafiltrate,
    the collecting duct also takes part in reabsorption.\n\n\n=== Hormone secretion
    ===\n\nThe kidneys secrete a variety of hormones, including erythropoietin, calcitriol,
    and renin. \n\nErythropoietin is released in response to hypoxia (low levels
    of oxygen at tissue level) in the renal circulation. \n\nIt stimulates erythropoiesis
    (production of red blood cells) in the bone marrow. \n\nCalcitriol, the activated
    form of vitamin D, promotes intestinal absorption of calcium and the renal reabsorption
    of phosphate. \n\nRenin is an enzyme which regulates angiotensin and aldosterone
    levels.\n\n\n=== Blood pressure regulation ===\n\n\nAlthough the kidney cannot
    directly sense blood, long-term regulation of blood pressure predominantly depends
    upon the kidney. \n\nThis primarily occurs through maintenance of the extracellular
    fluid compartment, the size of which depends on the plasma sodium concentration.
    \n\nRenin is the first in a series of important chemical messengers that make
    up the renin\u2013angiotensin system. \n\nChanges in renin ultimately alter the
    output of this system, principally the hormones angiotensin II and aldosterone.
    \n\nEach hormone acts via multiple mechanisms, but both increase the kidney's
    absorption of sodium chloride, thereby expanding the extracellular fluid compartment
    and raising blood pressure. \n\nWhen renin levels are elevated, the concentrations
    of angiotensin II and aldosterone increase, leading to increased sodium chloride
    reabsorption, expansion of the extracellular fluid compartment, and an increase
    in blood pressure. \n\nConversely, when renin levels are low, angiotensin II
    and aldosterone levels decrease, contracting the extracellular fluid compartment,
    and decreasing blood pressure.\n\n\n=== Acid\u2013base balance ===\n\n\nTwo organ
    systems, the kidneys and lungs, maintain acid\u2013base homeostasis, which is
    the maintenance of pH around a relatively stable value. \n\nThe lungs contribute
    to acid\u2013base homeostasis by regulating carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration.
    \n\nThe kidneys have two very important roles in maintaining the acid\u2013base
    balance: to reabsorb and regenerate bicarbonate from urine, and to excrete hydrogen
    ions and fixed acids (anions of acids) into urine.\n\n\n=== Regulation of osmolality
    ===\n\nThe kidneys help maintain the water and salt level of the body. \n\nAny
    significant rise in plasma osmolality is detected by the hypothalamus, which
    communicates directly with the posterior pituitary gland. \n\nAn increase in
    osmolality causes the gland to secrete antidiuretic hormone (ADH), resulting
    in water reabsorption by the kidney and an increase in urine concentration. \n\nThe
    two factors work together to return the plasma osmolality to its normal levels.\n\n\n===
    Measuring function ===\n\n\nVarious calculations and methods are used to try
    to measure kidney function. \n\nRenal clearance is the volume of plasma from
    which the substance is completely cleared from the blood per unit time. \n\nThe
    filtration fraction is the amount of plasma that is actually filtered through
    the kidney. \n\nThis can be defined using the equation. \n\nThe kidney is a very
    complex organ and mathematical modelling has been used to better understand kidney
    function at several scales, including fluid uptake and secretion.\n\n\n== Clinical
    significance ==\n\n\nNephrology is the subspeciality under Internal Medicine
    that deals with kidney function and disease states related to renal malfunction
    and their management including dialysis and kidney transplantation. \n\nUrology
    is the specialty under Surgery that deals with kidney structure abnormalities
    such as kidney cancer and cysts and problems with urinary tract. \n\nNephrologists
    are internists, and urologists are surgeons, whereas both are often called \"kidney
    doctors\". \n\nThere are overlapping areas that both nephrologists and urologists
    can provide care such as kidney stones and kidney related infections.\nThere
    are many causes of kidney disease. \n\nSome causes are acquired over the course
    of life, such as diabetic nephropathy whereas others are congenital, such as
    polycystic kidney disease.\n\nMedical terms related to the kidneys commonly use
    terms such as renal and the prefix nephro-. \n\nThe adjective renal, meaning
    related to the kidney, is from the Latin r\u0113n\u0113s, meaning kidneys; the
    prefix nephro- is from the Ancient Greek word for kidney, nephros (\u03BD\u03B5\u03C6\u03C1\u03CC\u03C2).
    \n\nFor example, surgical removal of the kidney is a nephrectomy, while a reduction
    in kidney function is called renal dysfunction.\n\n\n=== Acquired ===\n\nDiabetic
    nephropathy\nGlomerulonephritis\nHydronephrosis is the enlargement of one or
    both of the kidneys caused by obstruction of the flow of urine.\nInterstitial
    nephritis\nKidney stones (nephrolithiasis) are a relatively common and particularly
    painful disorder. \n\nA chronic condition can result in scars to the kidneys.
    \n\nThe removal of kidney stones involves ultrasound treatment to break up the
    stones into smaller pieces, which are then passed through the urinary tract.
    \n\nOne common symptom of kidney stones is a sharp to disabling pain in the middle
    and sides of the lower back or groin.\nKidney tumour\nWilms tumor\nRenal cell
    carcinoma\nLupus nephritis\nMinimal change disease\nIn nephrotic syndrome, the
    glomerulus has been damaged so that a large amount of protein in the blood enters
    the urine. \n\nOther frequent features of the nephrotic syndrome include swelling,
    low serum albumin, and high cholesterol.\n\nPyelonephritis is infection of the
    kidneys and is frequently caused by complication of a urinary tract infection.\nKidney

    hypertension\n\n\n=== Kidney injury and failure ===\n\n\nGenerally, humans can
    live normally with just one kidney, as one has more functioning renal tissue
    than is needed to survive. \n\nOnly when the amount of functioning kidney tissue
    is greatly diminished does one develop chronic kidney disease. \n\nRenal replacement
    therapy, in the form of dialysis or kidney transplantation, is indicated when
    the glomerular filtration rate has fallen very low or if the renal dysfunction
    leads to severe symptoms.\n\n\n=== Dialysis ===\n\n\nDialysis is a treatment
    that substitutes for the function of normal kidneys. \n\nDialysis may be instituted
    when approximately 85%-90% of kidney function is lost, as indicated by a glomerular
    filtration rate (GFR) of less than 15. \n\nDialysis removes metabolic waste products
    as well as excess water and sodium (thereby contributing to regulating blood
    pressure); and maintains many chemical levels within the body. \n\nLife expectancy
    is 5\u201310 years for those on dialysis; some live up to 30 years. \n\nDialysis
    can occur via the blood (through a catheter or arteriovenous fistula), or through
    the peritoneum (peritoneal dialysis) Dialysis is typically administered three
    times a week for several hours at free-standing dialysis centers, allowing recipients
    to lead an otherwise essentially normal life.\n\n\n=== Congenital disease ===\n\nCongenital
    hydronephrosis\nCongenital obstruction of urinary tract\nDuplex kidneys, or double
    kidneys, occur in approximately 1% of the population. \n\nThis occurrence normally
    causes no complications, but can occasionally cause urinary tract infections.\nDuplicated
    ureter occurs in approximately one in 100 live births\nHorseshoe kidney occurs
    in approximately one in 400 live births\nNephroblastoma (Syndromic Wilm's tumour)\nNutcracker
    syndrome\nPolycystic kidney disease\nAutosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease
    afflicts patients later in life. \n\nApproximately one in 1000 people will develop
    this condition\nAutosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease is far less common,
    but more severe, than the dominant condition. \n\nIt is apparent in utero or
    at birth.\nRenal agenesis. \n\nFailure of one kidney to form occurs in approximately
    one in 750 live births. \n\nFailure of both kidneys to form used to be fatal;
    however, medical advances such as amnioinfusion therapy during pregnancy and
    peritoneal dialysis have made it possible to stay alive until a transplant can
    occur.\nRenal dysplasia\nUnilateral small kidney\nMulticystic dysplastic kidney
    occurs in approximately one in every 2400 live births\nUreteropelvic Junction
    Obstruction or UPJO; although most cases are congenital, some are acquired.\n\n\n===
    Diagnosis ===\n\nMany renal diseases are diagnosed on the basis of a detailed
    medical history, and physical examination. \n\nThe medical history takes into
    account present and past symptoms, especially those of kidney disease; recent
    infections; exposure to substances toxic to the kidney; and family history of
    kidney disease.\nKidney function is tested by using blood tests and urine tests.
    \n\nThe most common blood test are creatinine, urea and electrolytes. \n\nUrine
    tests such as urinalysis can evaluate for pH, protein, glucose, and the presence
    of blood. \n\nMicroscopic analysis can also identify the presence of urinary
    casts and crystals. \n\nThe glomerular filtration rate (GFR) can be directly
    measured (\"measured GFR\", or mGFR) but this rarely done in everyday practice.
    \n\nInstead, special equations are used to calculate GFR (\"estimated GFR\",
    or eGFR).\n\n\n==== Imaging ====\n\nRenal ultrasonography is essential in the
    diagnosis and management of kidney-related diseases. \n\nOther modalities, such
    as CT and MRI, should always be considered as supplementary imaging modalities
    in the assessment of renal disease.\n\n\n==== Biopsy ====\n\nThe role of the
    renal biopsy is to diagnose renal disease in which the etiology is not clear
    based upon noninvasive means (clinical history, past medical history, medication
    history, physical exam, laboratory studies, imaging studies). \n\nIn general,
    a renal pathologist will perform a detailed morphological evaluation and integrate
    the morphologic findings with the clinical history and laboratory data, ultimately
    arriving at a pathological diagnosis. \n\nA renal pathologist is a physician
    who has undergone general training in anatomic pathology and additional specially
    training in the interpretation of renal biopsy specimens.\n\nIdeally, multiple
    core sections are obtained and evaluated for adequacy (presence of glomeruli)
    intraoperatively. \n\nA pathologist/pathology assistant divides the specimen(s)
    for submission for light microscopy, immunofluorescence microscopy and electron
    microscopy.\n\nThe pathologist will examine the specimen using light microscopy
    with multiple staining techniques (hematoxylin and eosin/H&E, PAS, trichrome,
    silver stain) on multiple level sections. \n\nMultiple immunofluorescence stains
    are performed to evaluate for antibody, protein and complement deposition. \n\nFinally,
    ultra-structural examination is performed with electron microscopy and may reveal
    the presence of electron-dense deposits or other characteristic abnormalities
    that may suggest an etiology for the patient's renal disease.\n\n\n== Other animals
    ==\n\nIn the majority of vertebrates, the mesonephros persists into the adult,
    albeit usually fused with the more advanced metanephros; only in amniotes is
    the mesonephros restricted to the embryo. \n\nThe kidneys of fish and amphibians
    are typically narrow, elongated organs, occupying a significant portion of the
    trunk. \n\nThe collecting ducts from each cluster of nephrons usually drain into
    an archinephric duct, which is homologous with the vas deferens of amniotes.
    \n\nHowever, the situation is not always so simple; in cartilaginous fish and
    some amphibians, there is also a shorter duct, similar to the amniote ureter,
    which drains the posterior (metanephric) parts of the kidney, and joins with
    the archinephric duct at the bladder or cloaca. \n\nIndeed, in many cartilaginous
    fish, the anterior portion of the kidney may degenerate or cease to function
    altogether in the adult.In the most primitive vertebrates, the hagfish and lampreys,
    the kidney is unusually simple: it consists of a row of nephrons, each emptying
    directly into the archinephric duct. \n\nInvertebrates may possess excretory
    organs that are sometimes referred to as \"kidneys\", but, even in Amphioxus,
    these are never homologous with the kidneys of vertebrates, and are more accurately
    referred to by other names, such as nephridia. \n\nIn amphibians, kidneys and
    the urinary bladder harbour specialized parasites, monogeneans of the family
    Polystomatidae.The kidneys of reptiles consist of a number of lobules arranged
    in a broadly linear pattern. \n\nEach lobule contains a single branch of the
    ureter in its centre, into which the collecting ducts empty. \n\nReptiles have
    relatively few nephrons compared with other amniotes of a similar size, possibly
    because of their lower metabolic rate.Birds have relatively large, elongated
    kidneys, each of which is divided into three or more distinct lobes. \n\nThe
    lobes consists of several small, irregularly arranged, lobules, each centred
    on a branch of the ureter. \n\nBirds have small glomeruli, but about twice as
    many nephrons as similarly sized mammals.The human kidney is fairly typical of
    that of mammals. \n\nDistinctive features of the mammalian kidney, in comparison
    with that of other vertebrates, include the presence of the renal pelvis and
    renal pyramids and a clearly distinguishable cortex and medulla. \n\nThe latter
    feature is due to the presence of elongated loops of Henle; these are much shorter
    in birds, and not truly present in other vertebrates (although the nephron often
    has a short intermediate segment between the convoluted tubules). \n\nIt is only
    in mammals that the kidney takes on its classical \"kidney\" shape, although
    there are some exceptions, such as the multilobed reniculate kidneys of pinnipeds
    and cetaceans.\n\n\n=== Evolutionary adaptation ===\n\nKidneys of various animals
    show evidence of evolutionary adaptation and have long been studied in ecophysiology
    and comparative physiology. \n\nKidney morphology, often indexed as the relative
    medullary thickness, is associated with habitat aridity among species of mammals
    and diet (e.g., carnivores have only long loops of Henle).\n\n\n== Society and
    culture ==\n\n\n\n=== Significance ===\n\n\n\n==== Egyptian ====\n\nIn ancient
    Egypt, the kidneys, like the heart, were left inside the mummified bodies, unlike
    other organs which were removed. \n\nComparing this to the biblical statements,
    and to drawings of human body with the heart and two kidneys portraying a set
    of scales for weighing justice, it seems that the Egyptian beliefs had also connected
    the kidneys with judgement and perhaps with moral decisions.\n\n\n==== Hebrew
    ====\n\nAccording to studies in modern and ancient Hebrew, various body organs
    in humans and animals served also an emotional or logical role, today mostly
    attributed to the brain and the endocrine system. \n\nThe kidney is mentioned
    in several biblical verses in conjunction with the heart, much as the bowels
    were understood to be the \"seat\" of emotion \u2013 grief, joy and pain. \n\nSimilarly,
    the Talmud (Berakhoth 61.a) states that one of the two kidneys counsels what
    is good, and the other evil.\nIn the sacrifices offered at the biblical Tabernacle
    and later on at the temple in Jerusalem, the priests were instructed to remove
    the kidneys and the adrenal gland covering the kidneys of the sheep, goat and
    cattle offerings, and to burn them on the altar, as the holy part of the \"offering
    for God\" never to be eaten.\n\n\n==== India: Ayurvedic system ====\n\nIn ancient
    India, according to the Ayurvedic medical systems, the kidneys were considered
    the beginning of the excursion channels system, the 'head' of the Mutra Srotas,
    receiving from all other systems, and therefore important in determining a person's
    health balance and temperament by the balance and mixture of the three 'Dosha's
    \u2013 the three health elements: Vatha (or Vata) \u2013 air, Pitta \u2013 bile,
    and Kapha \u2013 mucus. \n\nThe temperament and health of a person can then be
    seen in the resulting color of the urine.Modern Ayurveda practitioners, a practice
    which is characterized as pseudoscience, have attempted to revive these methods
    in medical procedures as part of Ayurveda Urine therapy. \n\nThese procedures
    have been called \"nonsensical\" by skeptics.\n\n\n==== Medieval Christianity
    ====\n\nThe Latin term renes is related to the English word \"reins\", a synonym
    for the kidneys in Shakespearean English (e.g. \n\nMerry Wives of Windsor 3.5),
    which was also the time when the King James Version of the Bible was translated.
    \n\nKidneys were once popularly regarded as the seat of the conscience and reflection,
    and a number of verses in the Bible (e.g. \n\nPs. 7:9, Rev. 2:23) state that
    God searches out and inspects the kidneys, or \"reins\", of humans, together
    with the heart.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nKidney stones have been identified and
    recorded about as long as written historical records exist. \n\nThe urinary tract
    including the ureters, as well as their function to drain urine from the kidneys,
    has been described by Galen in the second century AD.The first to examine the
    ureter through an internal approach, called ureteroscopy, rather than surgery
    was Hampton Young in 1929. \n\nThis was improved on by VF Marshall who is the
    first published use of a flexible endoscope based on fiber optics, which occurred
    in 1964. \n\nThe insertion of a drainage tube into the renal pelvis, bypassing
    the uterers and urinary tract, called nephrostomy, was first described in 1941.
    \n\nSuch an approach differed greatly from the open surgical approaches within
    the urinary system employed during the preceding two millennia.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"

  descriptionText: "\n\nTRANSVERSE COLON/\nLARGE INTESTINE\n\n\nThe large intestine,
    also known as the large bowel, is the last part of the gastrointestinal tract
    and of the digestive system in vertebrates. \n\nWater is absorbed here and the
    remaining waste material is stored as feces before being removed by defecation.The
    colon is the largest portion of the large intestine, so many mentions of the
    large intestine and colon overlap in meaning whenever precision is not the focus.
    \n\nMost sources define the large intestine as the combination of the cecum,
    colon, rectum, and anal canal. \n\nSome other sources exclude the anal canal.In
    humans, the large intestine begins in the right iliac region of the pelvis, just
    at or below the waist, where it is joined to the end of the small intestine at
    the cecum, via the ileocecal valve. \n\nIt then continues as the colon ascending
    the abdomen, across the width of the abdominal cavity as the transverse colon,
    and then descending to the rectum and its endpoint at the anal canal. \n\nOverall,
    in humans, the large intestine is about 1.5 metres (5 ft) long, which is about
    one-fifth of the whole length of the gastrointestinal tract.\n\n\n== Structure
    ==\n\nThe colon is the last part of the digestive system. \n\nIt has a segmented
    appearance due to a series of saccules called haustra. \n\nIt extracts water
    and salt from solid wastes before they are eliminated from the body and is the
    site in which flora-aided (largely bacterial) fermentation of unabsorbed material
    occurs. \n\nUnlike the small intestine, the colon does not play a major role
    in absorption of foods and nutrients. \n\nAbout 1.5 litres or 45 ounces of water
    arrives in the colon each day.The length of the average adult human colon is
    65 inches or 166 cm (range of 80 to 313 cm) for males, and 61 inches or 155 cm
    (range of 80 to 214 cm) for females.\n\n\n=== Sections ===\n\n\nIn mammals, the
    colon consists of six sections: the cecum, the ascending colon, the transverse
    colon, the descending colon, the sigmoid colon, and the rectum.Sections of the
    colon are:\n\nThe cecum including the appendix\nThe ascending colon\nThe transverse
    colon including the colic flexures and transverse mesocolon\nThe descending colon\nThe
    sigmoid colon \u2013 the s-shaped region of the large intestine\nThe rectumThe
    parts of the colon are either intraperitoneal or behind it in the retroperitoneum.
    \n\nRetroperitoneal organs, in general, do not have a complete covering of peritoneum,
    so they are fixed in location. \n\nIntraperitoneal organs are completely surrounded
    by peritoneum and are therefore mobile. \n\nOf the colon, the ascending colon,
    descending colon and rectum are retroperitoneal, while the cecum, appendix, transverse
    colon and sigmoid colon are intraperitoneal. \n\nThis is important as it affects
    which organs can be easily accessed during surgery, such as a laparotomy.\nIn
    terms of diameter, the cecum is the widest, averaging slightly less than 9 cm
    in healthy individuals, and the transverse colon averages less than 6 cm in diameter.
    \n\nThe descending and sigmoid colon are slightly smaller, with the sigmoid colon
    averaging 4\u20135 cm (1.6\u20132.0 in) in diameter. \n\nDiameters larger than
    certain thresholds for each colonic section can be diagnostic for megacolon.\n\n\n====
    Cecum and appendix ====\nThe cecum is the first section of the colon and involved
    in the digestion, while the appendix which develops embryologically from it,
    is a structure of the colon, not involved in digestion and considered to be part
    of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue. \n\nThe function of the appendix is uncertain,
    but some sources believe that the appendix has a role in housing a sample of
    the colon's microflora, and is able to help to repopulate the colon with bacteria
    if the microflora has been damaged during the course of an immune reaction. \n\nThe
    appendix has also been shown to have a high concentration of lymphatic cells.\n\n\n====
    Ascending colon ====\nThe ascending colon is the first of four main sections
    of the large intestine. \n\nIt is connected to the small intestine by a section
    of bowel called the cecum. \n\nThe ascending colon runs upwards through the abdominal
    cavity toward the transverse colon for approximately eight inches (20 cm).\nOne
    of the main functions of the colon is to remove the water and other key nutrients
    from waste material and recycle it. \n\nAs the waste material exits the small
    intestine through the ileocecal valve, it will move into the cecum and then to
    the ascending colon where this process of extraction starts. \n\nThe waste material
    is pumped upwards toward the transverse colon by peristalsis. \n\nThe ascending
    colon is sometimes attached to the appendix via Gerlach's valve. \n\nIn ruminants,
    the ascending colon is known as the spiral colon.\nTaking into account all ages
    and sexes, colon cancer occurs here most often (41%).\n\n\n==== Transverse colon
    ====\nThe transverse colon is the part of the colon from the hepatic flexure,
    also known as the right colic, (the turn of the colon by the liver) to the splenic
    flexure also known as the left colic, (the turn of the colon by the spleen).
    \n\nThe transverse colon hangs off the stomach, attached to it by a large fold
    of peritoneum called the greater omentum. \n\nOn the posterior side, the transverse
    colon is connected to the posterior abdominal wall by a mesentery known as the
    transverse mesocolon.\nThe transverse colon is encased in peritoneum, and is
    therefore mobile (unlike the parts of the colon immediately before and after
    it).\nThe proximal two-thirds of the transverse colon is perfused by the middle
    colic artery, a branch of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA), while the latter
    third is supplied by branches of the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA). \n\nThe
    \"watershed\" area between these two blood supplies, which represents the embryologic
    division between the midgut and hindgut, is an area sensitive to ischemia.\n\n\n====
    Descending colon ====\nThe descending colon is the part of the colon from the
    splenic flexure to the beginning of the sigmoid colon. \n\nOne function of the
    descending colon in the digestive system is to store feces that will be emptied
    into the rectum. \n\nIt is retroperitoneal in two-thirds of humans. \n\nIn the
    other third, it has a (usually short) mesentery. \n\nThe arterial supply comes
    via the left colic artery. \n\nThe descending colon is also called the distal
    gut, as it is further along the gastrointestinal tract than the proximal gut.
    \n\nGut flora are very dense in this region.\n\n\n==== Sigmoid colon ====\nThe
    sigmoid colon is the part of the large intestine after the descending colon and
    before the rectum. \n\nThe name sigmoid means S-shaped (see sigmoid; cf. sigmoid
    sinus). \n\nThe walls of the sigmoid colon are muscular and contract to increase
    the pressure inside the colon, causing the stool to move into the rectum.\nThe
    sigmoid colon is supplied with blood from several branches (usually between 2
    and 6) of the sigmoid arteries, a branch of the IMA. \n\nThe IMA terminates as
    the superior rectal artery.\nSigmoidoscopy is a common diagnostic technique used
    to examine the sigmoid colon.\n\n\n==== Rectum ====\nThe rectum is the last section
    of the large intestine. \n\nIt holds the formed feces awaiting elimination via
    defecation.\nIt is about 12 cm long.\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\n\nThe cecum \u2013
    the first part of the large intestine\n\nTaeniae coli \u2013 three bands of smooth
    muscle\nHaustra \u2013 bulges caused by contraction of taeniae coli\nEpiploic
    appendages \u2013 small fat accumulations on the visceraThe taenia coli run the
    length of the large intestine. \n\nBecause the taenia coli are shorter than the
    large bowel itself, the colon becomes sacculated, forming the haustra of the
    colon which are the shelf-like intraluminal projections.\n\n\n=== Blood supply
    ===\n\nArterial supply to the colon comes from branches of the superior mesenteric
    artery (SMA) and inferior mesenteric artery (IMA). \n\nFlow between these two
    systems communicates via the marginal artery of the colon that runs parallel
    to the colon for its entire length. \n\nHistorically, a structure variously identified
    as the arc of Riolan or meandering mesenteric artery (of Moskowitz) was thought
    to connect the proximal SMA to the proximal IMA. \n\nThis variably present structure
    would be important if either vessel were occluded. \n\nHowever, at least one
    review of the literature questions the existence of this vessel, with some experts
    calling for the abolition of these terms from future medical literature.Venous
    drainage usually mirrors colonic arterial supply, with the inferior mesenteric
    vein draining into the splenic vein, and the superior mesenteric vein joining
    the splenic vein to form the hepatic portal vein that then enters the liver.\n\n\n===
    Lymphatic drainage ===\n\nLymphatic drainage from the ascending colon and proximal
    two-thirds of the transverse colon is to the colic lymph nodes and the superior
    mesenteric lymph nodes, which drain into the cisterna chyli. \n\nThe lymph from
    the distal one-third of the transverse colon, the descending colon, the sigmoid
    colon, and the upper rectum drain into the inferior mesenteric and colic lymph
    nodes. \n\nThe lower rectum to the anal canal above the pectinate line drain
    to the internal iliac nodes. \n\nThe anal canal below the pectinate line drains
    into the superficial inguinal nodes. \n\nThe pectinate line only roughly marks
    this transition.\n\n\n=== Nerve supply ===\n\nSympathetic supply : Superior &
    inferior mesenteric ganglia\nParasympathetic supply : Vagus & pelvic nerves\n\n\n===
    Development ===\n\n\n\n=== Variation ===\n\nOne variation on the normal anatomy
    of the colon occurs when extra loops form, resulting in a colon that is up to
    five metres longer than normal. \n\nThis condition, referred to as redundant
    colon, typically has no direct major health consequences, though rarely volvulus
    occurs, resulting in obstruction and requiring immediate medical attention. \n\nA
    significant indirect health consequence is that use of a standard adult colonoscope
    is difficult and in some cases impossible when a redundant colon is present,
    though specialized variants on the instrument (including the pediatric variant)
    are useful in overcoming this problem.\n\n\n== Microanatomy ==\n\n\n\n=== Colonic
    crypts ===\n\n\nThe wall of the large intestine is lined with simple columnar
    epithelium with invaginations. \n\nThe invaginations are called the intestinal
    glands or colonic crypts.\n\n        \nThe colon crypts are shaped like microscopic
    thick walled test tubes with a central hole down the length of the tube (the
    crypt lumen). \n\nFour tissue sections are shown here, two cut across the long
    axes of the crypts and two cut parallel to the long axes. \n\nIn these images
    the cells have been stained by immunohistochemistry to show a brown-orange color
    if the cells produce a mitochondrial protein called cytochrome c oxidase subunit
    I (CCOI). \n\nThe nuclei of the cells (located at the outer edges of the cells
    lining the walls of the crypts) are stained blue-gray with haematoxylin. \n\nAs
    seen in panels C and D, crypts are about 75 to about 110 cells long. \n\nBaker
    et al. found that the average crypt circumference is 23 cells. \n\nThus, by the
    images shown here, there are an average of about 1,725 to 2,530 cells per colonic
    crypt. \n\nNooteboom et al. measuring the number of cells in a small number of
    crypts reported a range of 1,500 to 4,900 cells per colonic crypt. \n\nCells
    are produced at the crypt base and migrate upward along the crypt axis before
    being shed into the colonic lumen days later. \n\nThere are 5 to 6 stem cells
    at the bases of the crypts.As estimated from the image in panel A, there are
    about 100 colonic crypts per square millimeter of the colonic epithelium. \n\nSince
    the average length of the human colon is 160.5 cm and the average inner circumference
    of the colon is 6.2 cm, the inner surface epithelial area of the human colon
    has an average area of about 995 cm2, which includes 9,950,000 (close to 10 million)
    crypts.\nIn the four tissue sections shown here, many of the intestinal glands
    have cells with a mitochondrial DNA mutation in the CCOI gene and appear mostly
    white, with their main color being the blue-gray staining of the nuclei. \n\nAs
    seen in panel B, a portion of the stem cells of three crypts appear to have a
    mutation in CCOI, so that 40% to 50% of the cells arising from those stem cells
    form a white segment in the cross cut area.\nOverall, the percent of crypts deficient
    for CCOI is less than 1% before age 40, but then increases linearly with age.
    \n\nColonic crypts deficient for CCOI in women reaches, on average, 18% in women
    and 23% in men by 80\u201384 years of age.Crypts of the colon can reproduce by
    fission, as seen in panel C, where a crypt is fissioning to form two crypts,
    and in panel B where at least one crypt appears to be fissioning. \n\nMost crypts
    deficient in CCOI are in clusters of crypts (clones of crypts) with two or more
    CCOI-deficient crypts adjacent to each other (see panel D).\n\n\n==== Mucosa
    ====\nAbout 150 of the many thousands of protein coding genes expressed in the
    large intestine, some are specific to the mucous membrane in different regions
    and include CEACAM7.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\n\nThe large intestine absorbs water
    and any remaining absorbable nutrients from the food before sending the indigestible
    matter to the rectum. \n\nThe colon absorbs vitamins that are created by the
    colonic bacteria, such as thiamine, riboflavin, and vitamin K (especially important
    as the daily ingestion of vitamin K is not normally enough to maintain adequate
    blood coagulation). \n\nIt also compacts feces, and stores fecal matter in the
    rectum until it can be discharged via the anus in defecation.\nThe large intestine
    also secretes K+ and Cl-. \n\nChloride secretion increases in cystic fibrosis.\nRecycling
    of various nutrients takes place in colon. \n\nExamples include fermentation
    of carbohydrates, short chain fatty acids, and urea cycling.The appendix contains
    a small amount of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue which gives the appendix
    an undetermined role in immunity. \n\nHowever, the appendix is known to be important
    in fetal life as it contains endocrine cells that release biogenic amines and
    peptide hormones important for homeostasis during early growth and development.
    \n\nThe appendix can be removed with no apparent damage or consequence to the
    patient.By the time the chyme has reached this tube, most nutrients and 90% of
    the water have been absorbed by the body. \n\nAt this point some electrolytes
    like sodium, magnesium, and chloride are left as well as indigestible parts of
    ingested food (e.g., a large part of ingested amylose, starch which has been
    shielded from digestion heretofore, and dietary fiber, which is largely indigestible
    carbohydrate in either soluble or insoluble form). \n\nAs the chyme moves through
    the large intestine, most of the remaining water is removed, while the chyme
    is mixed with mucus and bacteria (known as gut flora), and becomes feces. \n\nThe
    ascending colon receives fecal material as a liquid. \n\nThe muscles of the colon
    then move the watery waste material forward and slowly absorb all the excess
    water, causing the stools to gradually solidify as they move along into the descending
    colon.The bacteria break down some of the fiber for their own nourishment and
    create acetate, propionate, and butyrate as waste products, which in turn are
    used by the cell lining of the colon for nourishment. \n\nNo protein is made
    available. \n\nIn humans, perhaps 10% of the undigested carbohydrate thus becomes
    available, though this may vary with diet; in other animals, including other
    apes and primates, who have proportionally larger colons, more is made available,
    thus permitting a higher portion of plant material in the diet. \n\nThe large
    intestine produces no digestive enzymes \u2014 chemical digestion is completed
    in the small intestine before the chyme reaches the large intestine. \n\nThe
    pH in the colon varies between 5.5 and 7 (slightly acidic to neutral).\n\n\n===
    Standing gradient osmosis ===\n\nWater absorption at the colon typically proceeds
    against a transmucosal osmotic pressure gradient. \n\nThe standing gradient osmosis
    is the reabsorption of water against the osmotic gradient in the intestines.
    \n\nCells occupying the intestinal lining pump sodium ions into the intercellular
    space, raising the osmolarity of the intercellular fluid. \n\nThis hypertonic
    fluid creates an osmotic pressure that drives water into the lateral intercellular
    spaces by osmosis via tight junctions and adjacent cells, which then in turn
    moves across the basement membrane and into the capillaries, while more sodium
    ions are pumped again into the intercellular fluid. \n\nAlthough water travels
    down an osmotic gradient in each individual step, overall, water usually travels
    against the osmotic gradient due to the pumping of sodium ions into the intercellular
    fluid. \n\nThis allows the large intestine to absorb water despite the blood
    in capillaries being hypotonic compared to the fluid within the intestinal lumen.\n\n\n===
    Gut flora ===\n\n\nThe large intestine houses over 700 species of bacteria that
    perform a variety of functions, as well as fungi, protozoa, and archaea. \n\nSpecies
    diversity varies by geography and diet. \n\nThe microbes in a human distal gut
    often number in the vicinity of 100 trillion, and can weigh around 200 grams
    (0.44 pounds). \n\nThis mass of mostly symbiotic microbes has recently been called
    the latest human organ to be \"discovered\" or in other words, the \"forgotten
    organ\".The large intestine absorbs some of the products formed by the bacteria
    inhabiting this region. \n\nUndigested polysaccharides (fiber) are metabolized
    to short-chain fatty acids by bacteria in the large intestine and absorbed by
    passive diffusion. \n\nThe bicarbonate that the large intestine secretes helps
    to neutralize the increased acidity resulting from the formation of these fatty
    acids.These bacteria also produce large amounts of vitamins, especially vitamin
    K and biotin (a B vitamin), for absorption into the blood. \n\nAlthough this
    source of vitamins, in general, provides only a small part of the daily requirement,
    it makes a significant contribution when dietary vitamin intake is low. \n\nAn
    individual who depends on absorption of vitamins formed by bacteria in the large
    intestine may become vitamin-deficient if treated with antibiotics that inhibit
    the vitamin producing species of bacteria as well as the intended disease-causing
    bacteria.Other bacterial products include gas (flatus), which is a mixture of
    nitrogen and carbon dioxide, with small amounts of the gases hydrogen, methane,
    and hydrogen sulfide. \n\nBacterial fermentation of undigested polysaccharides
    produces these. \n\nSome of the fecal odor is due to indoles, metabolized from
    the amino acid tryptophan. \n\nThe normal flora is also essential in the development
    of certain tissues, including the cecum and lymphatics.They are also involved
    in the production of cross-reactive antibodies. \n\nThese are antibodies produced
    by the immune system against the normal flora, that are also effective against
    related pathogens, thereby preventing infection or invasion.\nThe two most prevalent
    phyla of the colon are firmicutes and bacteroidetes. \n\nThe ratio between the
    two seems to vary widely as reported by the Human Microbiome Project. \n\nBacteroides
    are implicated in the initiation of colitis and colon cancer. \n\nBifidobacteria
    are also abundant, and are often described as 'friendly bacteria'.A mucus layer
    protects the large intestine from attacks from colonic commensal bacteria.\n\n\n==
    Clinical significance ==\n\n\n\n=== Disease ===\n\n\nFollowing are the most common
    diseases or disorders of the colon:\n\n\n=== Colonoscopy ===\n\n\nColonoscopy
    is the endoscopic examination of the large intestine and the distal part of the
    small bowel with a CCD camera or a fiber optic camera on a flexible tube passed
    through the anus. \n\nIt can provide a visual diagnosis (e.g. ulceration, polyps)
    and grants the opportunity for biopsy or removal of suspected colorectal cancer
    lesions. \n\nColonoscopy can remove polyps as small as one millimetre or less.
    \n\nOnce polyps are removed, they can be studied with the aid of a microscope
    to determine if they are precancerous or not. \n\nIt takes 15 years or less for
    a polyp to turn cancerous.\nColonoscopy is similar to sigmoidoscopy\u2014the
    difference being related to which parts of the colon each can examine. \n\nA
    colonoscopy allows an examination of the entire colon (1200\u20131500 mm in length).
    \n\nA sigmoidoscopy allows an examination of the distal portion (about 600 mm)
    of the colon, which may be sufficient because benefits to cancer survival of
    colonoscopy have been limited to the detection of lesions in the distal portion
    of the colon.A sigmoidoscopy is often used as a screening procedure for a full
    colonoscopy, often done in conjunction with a stool-based test such as a fecal
    occult blood test (FOBT), fecal immunochemical test (FIT), or multi-target stool
    DNA test (Cologuard) or blood-based test, SEPT9 DNA methylation test (Epi proColon).
    \n\nAbout 5% of these screened patients are referred to colonoscopy.Virtual colonoscopy,
    which uses 2D and 3D imagery reconstructed from computed tomography (CT) scans
    or from nuclear magnetic resonance (MR) scans, is also possible, as a totally
    non-invasive medical test, although it is not standard and still under investigation
    regarding its diagnostic abilities. \n\nFurthermore, virtual colonoscopy does
    not allow for therapeutic maneuvers such as polyp/tumour removal or biopsy nor
    visualization of lesions smaller than 5 millimeters. \n\nIf a growth or polyp
    is detected using CT colonography, a standard colonoscopy would still need to
    be performed. \n\nAdditionally, surgeons have lately been using the term pouchoscopy
    to refer to a colonoscopy of the ileo-anal pouch.\n\n\n== Other animals ==\n\nThe
    large intestine is truly distinct only in tetrapods, in which it is almost always
    separated from the small intestine by an ileocaecal valve. \n\nIn most vertebrates,
    however, it is a relatively short structure running directly to the anus, although
    noticeably wider than the small intestine. \n\nAlthough the caecum is present
    in most amniotes, only in mammals does the remainder of the large intestine develop
    into a true colon.In some small mammals, the colon is straight, as it is in other
    tetrapods, but, in the majority of mammalian species, it is divided into ascending
    and descending portions; a distinct transverse colon is typically present only
    in primates. \n\nHowever, the taeniae coli and accompanying haustra are not found
    in either carnivorans or ruminants. \n\nThe rectum of mammals (other than monotremes)
    is derived from the cloaca of other vertebrates, and is, therefore, not truly
    homologous with the \"rectum\" found in these species.In fish, there is no true
    large intestine, but simply a short rectum connecting the end of the digestive
    part of the gut to the cloaca. \n\nIn sharks, this includes a rectal gland that
    secretes salt to help the animal maintain osmotic balance with the seawater.
    \n\nThe gland somewhat resembles a caecum in structure but is not a homologous
    structure.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_intestine"

  descriptionText: "\n\nRENAL PELVIS\n\n\nThe renal pelvis or pelvis of the kidney
    is the funnel-like dilated part of the ureter in the kidney. \n\nIn humans, the
    renal pelvis is the point where the two or three major calyces join. \n\nIt has
    a mucous membrane and is covered with transitional epithelium and an underlying
    lamina propria of loose-to-dense connective tissue.\nThe renal pelvis functions
    as a funnel for urine flowing to the ureter.\nThe renal pelvis is the location
    of several kinds of kidney cancer and is affected by infection in pyelonephritis.\n\n\n==
    Clinical significance ==\n\nThe renal pelvis is the location of several kinds
    of kidney cancer and is affected by infection in pyelonephritis. \n\nA large
    \"staghorn\" kidney stone may block all or part of the renal pelvis.\nThe size
    of the renal pelvis plays a major role in the grading of hydronephrosis. \n\nNormally,
    the anteroposterior diameter of the renal pelvis is less than 4 mm in fetuses
    up to 32 weeks of gestational age and 7 mm afterwards. \n\nIn adults, 13% of
    the normal population have a transverse pelvic diameter of over 10 mm.\n\n\n==
    Etymology and pronunciation ==\n\nLike the bony pelvis, the renal pelvis () gets
    its English name via New Latin from the older Latin word pelvis, \"basin\", as
    in \"wash basin\". \n\nIn both cases the name reflects the shape of the structure,
    and in the case of the renal pelvis, it also reflects the function. \n\nThe name
    reflects that each renal pelvis collects urine from the calyces and funnels it
    into the ureter like a wash basin collects water and funnels it into a drain
    pipe. \n\nThe renal pelvis is occasionally called the pyelum (from Greek \u03C0\u03CD\u03B5\u03BB\u03BF\u03C2
    p\xFDelos, \"trough\", \u2018anything hollow\u2019), and the combining form pyelo-
    denotes the renal pelvis (pyelo- is not to be confused with pyo-). \n\nThe words
    infundibulum and choana are other words for funnel-shaped cavities (which medical
    English got from the Latin and Greek words for \"funnel\", respectively), and
    the renal pelvis is sometimes called the renal infundibulum. \n\nThe form *renal
    choana is logical but is not used.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_pelvis"

  descriptionText: "\n\nOESOPHAGUS/ESOPHAGUS\n\n\nThe oesophagus (British English;
    both) or esophagus (American English), informally known as the food pipe or gullet,
    is an organ in vertebrates through which food passes, aided by peristaltic contractions,
    from the pharynx to the stomach. \n\nThe oesophagus is a fibromuscular tube,
    about 25 cm (10 in) long in adults, that travels behind the trachea and heart,
    passes through the diaphragm, and empties into the uppermost region of the stomach.
    \n\nDuring swallowing, the epiglottis tilts backwards to prevent food from going
    down the larynx and lungs. \n\nThe word ooesophagus is from Ancient Greek \u03BF\u1F30\u03C3\u03BF\u03C6\u03AC\u03B3\u03BF\u03C2
    (oisoph\xE1gos), from \u03BF\u1F34\u03C3\u03C9 (o\xEDs\u014D), future form of
    \u03C6\u03AD\u03C1\u03C9 (ph\xE9r\u014D, \u201CI carry\u201D) + \u1F14\u03C6\u03B1\u03B3\u03BF\u03BD
    (\xE9phagon, \u201CI ate\u201D).\n\nThe wall of the oesophagus from the lumen
    outwards consists of mucosa, submucosa (connective tissue), layers of muscle
    fibers between layers of fibrous tissue, and an outer layer of connective tissue.
    \n\nThe mucosa is a stratified squamous epithelium of around three layers of
    squamous cells, which contrasts to the single layer of columnar cells of the
    stomach. \n\nThe transition between these two types of epithelium is visible
    as a zig-zag line. \n\nMost of the muscle is smooth muscle although striated
    muscle predominates in its upper third. \n\nIt has two muscular rings or sphincters
    in its wall, one at the top and one at the bottom. \n\nThe lower sphincter helps
    to prevent reflux of acidic stomach content. \n\nThe oesophagus has a rich blood
    supply and venous drainage. \n\nIts smooth muscle is innervated by involuntary
    nerves (sympathetic nerves via the sympathetic trunk and parasympathetic nerves
    via the vagus nerve) and in addition voluntary nerves (lower motor neurons) which
    are carried in the vagus nerve to innervate its striated muscle.\n\nThe oesophagus
    passes through the thoracic cavity into the diaphragm into the stomach.\n\nThe
    oesophagus may be affected by gastric reflux, cancer, prominent dilated blood
    vessels called varices that can bleed heavily, tears, constrictions, and disorders
    of motility. \n\nDiseases may cause difficulty swallowing (dysphagia), painful
    swallowing (odynophagia), chest pain, or cause no symptoms at all. \n\nClinical
    investigations include X-rays when swallowing barium sulfate, endoscopy, and
    CT scans. \n\nSurgically, \nthe oesophagus is difficult to access in part due
    to its position between critical organs and directly between the sternum and
    spinal column.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe oesophagus is one of the upper parts
    of the digestive system. \n\nThere are taste buds on its upper part. \n\nIt begins
    at the back of the mouth, passing downward through the rear part of the mediastinum,
    through the diaphragm, and into the stomach. \n\nIn humans, the oesophagus generally
    starts around the level of the sixth cervical vertebra behind the cricoid cartilage
    of the trachea, enters the diaphragm at about the level of the tenth thoracic
    vertebra, and ends at the cardia of the stomach, at the level of the eleventh
    thoracic vertebra. \n\nThe oesophagus is usually about 25 cm (10 in) in length.Many
    blood vessels serve the oesophagus, with blood supply varying along its course.
    \n\nThe upper parts of the oesophagus and the upper esophageal sphincter receive
    blood from the inferior thyroid artery, the parts of the oesophagus in the thorax
    from the bronchial arteries and branches directly from the thoracic aorta, and
    the lower parts of the oesophagus and the lower esophageal sphincter receive
    blood from the left gastric artery and the left inferior phrenic artery. \n\nThe
    venous drainage also differs along the course of the oesophagus. \n\nThe upper
    and middle parts of the oesophagus drain into the azygos and hemiazygos veins,
    and blood from the lower part drains into the left gastric vein. \n\nAll these
    veins drain into the superior vena cava, with the exception of the left gastric
    vein, which is a branch of the portal vein. \n\nLymphatically, the upper third
    of the oesophagus drains into the deep cervical lymph nodes, the middle into
    the superior and posterior mediastinal lymph nodes, and the lower oesophagus
    into the gastric and celiac lymph nodes. \n\nThis is similar to the lymphatic
    drainage of the abdominal structures that arise from the foregut, which all drain
    into the celiac nodes.\n\nPosition\nThe upper oesophagus lies at the back of
    the mediastinum behind the trachea, adjoining along the tracheoesophageal stripe,
    and in front of the erector spinae muscles and the vertebral column. \n\nThe
    lower oesophagus lies behind the heart and curves in front of the thoracic aorta.
    \n\nFrom the bifurcation of the trachea downwards, the oesophagus passes behind
    the right pulmonary artery, left main bronchus, and left atrium. \n\nAt this
    point, it passes through the diaphragm.\n\nThe thoracic duct, which drains the
    majority of the body's lymph, passes behind the oesophagus, curving from lying
    behind the oesophagus on the right in the lower part of the oesophagus, to lying
    behind the oesophagus on the left in the upper oesophagus. \n\nThe oesophagus
    also lies in front of parts of the hemiazygos veins and the intercostal veins
    on the right side. \n\nThe vagus nerve divides and covers the oesophagus in a
    plexus.\n\nConstrictions\nThe oesophagus has four points of constriction. \n\nWhen
    a corrosive substance, or a solid object is swallowed, it is most likely to lodge
    and damage one of these four points. \n\nThese constrictions arise from particular
    structures that compress the oesophagus. \n\nThese constrictions are:\n-At the
    start of the oesophagus, where the laryngopharynx joins the oesophagus, behind
    the cricoid cartilage\n-Where it is crossed on the front by the aortic arch in
    the superior mediastinum\n-Where the oesophagus is compressed by the left main
    bronchus in the posterior mediastinum\n-The esophageal hiatus, where it passes
    through the diaphragm in the posterior mediastinum\n\n\n=== Sphincters ===\n\nThe
    oesophagus is surrounded at the top and bottom by two muscular rings, known respectively
    as the upper esophageal sphincter and the lower esophageal sphincter. \n\nThese
    sphincters act to close the oesophagus when food is not being swallowed. \n\nThe
    upper esophageal sphincter is an anatomical sphincter, which is formed by the
    lower portion of the inferior pharyngeal constrictor, also known as the cricopharyngeal
    sphincter due to its relation with cricoid cartilage of the larynx anteriorly.
    \n\nHowever, the lower esophageal sphincter is not an anatomical but rather a
    functional sphincter, meaning that it acts as a sphincter but does not have a
    distinct thickening like other sphincters.\nThe upper esophageal sphincter surrounds
    the upper part of the oesophagus. \n\nIt consists of skeletal muscle but is not
    under voluntary control. \n\nOpening of the upper esophageal sphincter is triggered
    by the swallowing reflex. \n\nThe primary muscle of the upper esophageal sphincter
    is the cricopharyngeal part of the inferior pharyngeal constrictor.\n\nThe lower
    esophageal sphincter, or gastroesophageal sphincter, surrounds the lower part
    of the oesophagus at the junction between the oesophagus and the stomach. \n\nIt
    is also called the cardiac sphincter or cardioesophageal sphincter, named from
    the adjacent part of the stomach, the cardia. \n\nDysfunction of the gastroesophageal
    sphincter causes gastroesophageal reflux, which causes heartburn and if it happens
    often enough, can lead to gastroesophageal reflux disease, with damage of the
    esophageal mucosa.\n\n\n=== Nerve supply ===\n\nThe oesophagus is innervated
    by the vagus nerve and the cervical and thoracic sympathetic trunk. \n\nThe vagus
    nerve has a parasympathetic function, supplying the muscles of the oesophagus
    and stimulating glandular contraction. \n\nTwo sets of nerve fibers travel in
    the vagus nerve to supply the muscles. \n\nThe upper striated muscle, and upper
    esophageal sphincter, are supplied by neurons with bodies in the nucleus ambiguus,
    whereas fibers that supply the smooth muscle and lower esophageal sphincter have
    bodies situated in the dorsal motor nucleus. \n\nThe vagus nerve plays the primary
    role in initiating peristalsis. \n\nThe sympathetic trunk has a sympathetic function.
    \n\nIt may enhance the function of the vagus nerve, increasing peristalsis and
    glandular activity, and causing sphincter contraction. \n\nIn addition, sympathetic
    activation may relax the muscle wall and cause blood vessel constriction. \n\nSensation
    along the oesophagus is supplied by both nerves, with gross sensation being passed
    in the vagus nerve and pain passed up the sympathetic trunk.\n\n\n=== Gastro-esophageal
    junction ===\n\nThe gastro-esophageal junction (also known as the esophagogastric
    junction) is the junction between the oesophagus and the stomach, at the lower
    end of the oesophagus. \n\nThe pink color of the esophageal mucosa contrasts
    to the deeper red of the gastric mucosa, and the mucosal transition can be seen
    as an irregular zig-zag line, which is often called the z-line. \n\nHistological
    examination reveals abrupt transition between the stratified squamous epithelium
    of the oesophagus and the simple columnar epithelium of the stomach. \n\nNormally,
    the cardia of the stomach is immediately distal to the z-line and the z-line
    coincides with the upper limit of the gastric folds of the cardia; however, when
    the anatomy of the mucosa is distorted in Barrett's oesophagus the true gastro-eshophageal
    junction can be identified by the upper limit of the gastric folds rather than
    the mucosal transition. \n\nThe functional location of the lower oesophageal
    sphincter is generally situated about 3 cm (1+1\u20444 in) below the z-line.\n\n\n===
    Microanatomy ===\n\n\nThe human oesophagus has a mucous membrane consisting of
    a tough stratified squamous epithelium without keratin, a smooth lamina propria,
    and a muscularis mucosae. \n\nThe epithelium of the oesophagus has a relatively
    rapid turnover and serves a protective function against the abrasive effects
    of food. \n\nIn many animals, the epithelium contains a layer of keratin, representing
    a coarser diet. \n\nThere are two types of glands, with mucus-secreting esophageal
    glands being found in the submucosa and esophageal cardiac glands, similar to
    cardiac glands of the stomach, located in the lamina propria and most frequent
    in the terminal part of the organ. \n\nThe mucus from the glands gives a good
    protection to the lining. \n\nThe submucosa also contains the submucosal plexus,
    a network of nerve cells that is part of the enteric nervous system.The muscular
    layer of the oesophagus has two types of muscle. \n\nThe upper third of the oesophagus
    contains striated muscle, the lower third contains smooth muscle, and the middle
    third contains a mixture of both. \n\nMuscle is arranged in two layers: one in
    which the muscle fibers run longitudinal to the oesophagus, and the other in
    which the fibers encircle the oesophagus. \n\nThese are separated by the myenteric
    plexus, a tangled network of nerve fibers involved in the secretion of mucus
    and in peristalsis of the smooth muscle of the oesophagus. \n\nThe outermost
    layer of the oesophagus is the adventitia in most of its length, with the abdominal
    part being covered in serosa. \n\nThis makes it distinct from many other structures
    in the gastrointestinal tract that only have a serosa.\n\n\n== Development ==\n\nIn
    early embryogenesis, the oesophagus develops from the endodermal primitive gut
    tube. \n\nThe ventral part of the embryo abuts the yolk sac. \n\nDuring the second
    week of embryological development, as the embryo grows, it begins to surround
    parts of the sac. \n\nThe enveloped portions form the basis for the adult gastrointestinal
    tract. \n\nThe sac is surrounded by a network of vitelline arteries. \n\nOver
    time, these arteries consolidate into the three main arteries that supply the
    developing gastrointestinal tract: the celiac artery, superior mesenteric artery,
    and inferior mesenteric artery. \n\nThe areas supplied by these arteries are
    used to define the midgut, hindgut and foregut.The surrounded sac becomes the
    primitive gut. \n\nSections of this gut begin to differentiate into the organs
    of the gastrointestinal tract, such as the oesophagus, stomach, and intestines.
    \n\nThe oesophagus develops as part of the foregut tube. \n\nThe innervation
    of the oesophagus develops from the pharyngeal arches.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\n===
    Swallowing ===\n\nFood is ingested through the mouth and when swallowed passes
    first into the pharynx and then into the oesophagus. \n\nThe oesophagus is thus
    one of the first components of the digestive system and the gastrointestinal
    tract. \n\nAfter food passes through the oesophagus, it enters the stomach. \n\nWhen
    food is being swallowed, the epiglottis moves backward to cover the larynx, preventing
    food from entering the trachea. \n\nAt the same time, the upper esophageal sphincter
    relaxes, allowing a bolus of food to enter. \n\nPeristaltic contractions of the
    esophageal muscle push the food down the oesophagus. \n\nThese rhythmic contractions
    occur both as a reflex response to food that is in the mouth, and also as a response
    to the sensation of food within the oesophagus itself. \n\nAlong with peristalsis,
    the lower esophageal sphincter relaxes.\n\n\n=== Reducing gastric reflux ===\n\nThe
    stomach produces gastric acid, a strongly acidic mixture consisting of hydrochloric
    acid (HCl) and potassium and sodium salts to enable food digestion. \n\nConstriction
    of the upper and lower esophageal sphincters helps to prevent reflux (backflow)
    of gastric contents and acid into the oesophagus, protecting the esophageal mucosa.
    \n\nThe acute angle of His and the lower crura of the diaphragm also help this
    sphincteric action.\n\n\n== Gene and protein expression ==\n\nAbout 20,000 protein-coding
    genes are expressed in human cells and nearly 70% of these genes are expressed
    in the normal oesophagus. \n\nSome 250 of these genes are more specifically expressed
    in the oesophagus with less than 50 genes being highly specific. \n\nThe corresponding
    oesophagus-specific proteins are mainly involved in squamous differentiation
    such as keratins KRT13, KRT4 and KRT6C. \n\nOther specific proteins that help
    lubricate the inner surface of oesophagus are mucins such as MUC21 and MUC22.
    \n\nMany genes with elevated expression are also shared with skin and other organs
    that are composed of squamous epithelia.\n\n\n== Clinical significance ==\n\nThe
    main conditions affecting the oesophagus are described here. \n\nFor a more complete
    list, see esophageal disease.\n\n\n=== Inflammation ===\n\n\nInflammation of
    the oesophagus is known as esophagitis. \n\nReflux of gastric acids from the
    stomach, infection, substances ingested (for example, corrosives), some medications
    (such as bisphosphonates), and food allergies can all lead to esophagitis. \n\nEsophageal
    candidiasis is an infection of the yeast Candida albicans that may occur when
    a person is immunocompromised. \n\nAs of 2021 the causes of some forms of esophagitis,
    such as eosinophilic esophagitis, are not well-characterized, but may include
    Th2-mediated atopies or genetic factors. \n\nThere appear to be correlations
    between eosinophilic esophagitis, asthma (itself with an eosinophilic component),
    eczema, and allergic rhinitis, though it is not clear whether these conditions
    contribute to eosinophilic esophagitis or vice versa, or if they are symptoms
    of mutual underlying factors. \n\nEsophagitis can cause painful swallowing and
    is usually treated by managing the cause of the esophagitis - such as managing
    reflux or treating infection.\n\n\n=== Barrett's oesophagus ===\n\n\nProlonged
    esophagitis, particularly from gastric reflux, is one factor thought to play
    a role in the development of Barrett's oesophagus. \n\nIn this condition, there
    is metaplasia of the lining of the lower oesophagus, which changes from stratified
    squamous epithelia to simple columnar epithelia. \n\nBarrett's oesophagus is
    thought to be one of the main contributors to the development of esophageal cancer.\n\n\n===
    Cancer ===\n\n\nThere are two main types of cancer of the oesophagus. \n\nSquamous
    cell carcinoma is a carcinoma that can occur in the squamous cells lining the
    oesophagus. \n\nThis type is much more common in China and Iran. \n\nThe other
    main type is an adenocarcinoma that occurs in the glands or columnar tissue of
    the oesophagus. \n\nThis is most common in developed countries in those with
    Barrett's oesophagus, and occurs in the cuboidal cells.\n\nIn its early stages,
    esophageal cancer may not have any symptoms at all. \n\nWhen severe, esophageal
    cancer may eventually cause obstruction of the oesophagus, making swallowing
    of any solid foods very difficult and causing weight loss. \n\nThe progress of
    the cancer is staged using a system that measures how far into the esophageal
    wall the cancer has invaded, how many lymph nodes are affected, and whether there
    are any metastases in different parts of the body. \n\nEsophageal cancer is often
    managed with radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and may also be managed by partial surgical
    removal of the oesophagus. \n\nInserting a stent into the oesophagus, or inserting
    a nasogastric tube, may also be used to ensure that a person is able to digest
    enough food and water. \n\nAs of 2014, the prognosis for esophageal cancer is
    still poor, so palliative therapy may also be a focus of treatment.\n\n\n===
    Varices ===\n\n\nEsophageal varices are swollen twisted branches of the azygous
    vein in the lower third of the oesophagus. \n\nThese blood vessels anastomose
    (join up) with those of the portal vein when portal hypertension develops. \n\nThese
    blood vessels are engorged more than normal, and in the worst cases may partially
    obstruct the oesophagus. \n\nThese blood vessels develop as part of a collateral
    circulation that occurs to drain blood from the abdomen as a result of portal
    hypertension, usually as a result of liver diseases such as cirrhosis.\n\nThis
    collateral circulation occurs because the lower part of the oesophagus drains
    into the left gastric vein, which is a branch of the portal vein. \n\nBecause
    of the extensive venous plexus that exists between this vein and other veins,
    if portal hypertension occurs, the direction of blood drainage in this vein may
    reverse, with blood draining from the portal venous system, through the plexus.
    \n\nVeins in the plexus may engorge and lead to varices.Esophageal varices often
    do not have symptoms until they rupture. \n\nA ruptured varix is considered a
    medical emergency because varices can bleed a lot. \n\nA bleeding varix may cause
    a person to vomit blood, or suffer shock. \n\nTo deal with a ruptured varix,
    a band may be placed around the bleeding blood vessel, or a small amount of a
    clotting agent may be injected near the bleed. \n\nA surgeon may also try to
    use a small inflatable balloon to apply pressure to stop the wound. \n\nIV fluids
    and blood products may be given in order to prevent hypovolemia from excess blood
    loss.\n\n\n=== Motility disorders ===\n\nSeveral disorders affect the motility
    of food as it travels down the oesophagus. \n\nThis can cause difficult swallowing,
    called dysphagia, or painful swallowing, called odynophagia. \n\nAchalasia refers
    to a failure of the lower esophageal sphincter to relax properly, and generally
    develops later in life. \n\nThis leads to progressive enlargement of the oesophagus,
    and possibly eventual megaoesophagus. \n\nA nutcracker oesophagus refers to swallowing
    that can be extremely painful. \n\nDiffuse esophageal spasm is a spasm of the
    oesophagus that can be one cause of chest pain. \n\nSuch referred pain to the
    wall of the upper chest is quite common in esophageal conditions. \n\nSclerosis
    of the oesophagus, such as with systemic sclerosis or in CREST syndrome may cause
    hardening of the walls of the oesophagus and interfere with peristalsis.\n\n\n===
    Malformations ===\n\nEsophageal strictures are usually benign and typically develop
    after a person has had reflux for many years. \n\nOther strictures may include
    esophageal webs (which can also be congenital) and damage to the oesophagus by
    radiotherapy, corrosive ingestion, or eosinophilic esophagitis. \n\nA Schatzki
    ring is fibrosis at the gastro-esophageal junction. \n\nStrictures may also develop
    in chronic anemia, and Plummer-Vinson syndrome.\n\nTwo of the most common congenital
    malformations affecting the oesophagus are an esophageal atresia where the oesophagus
    ends in a blind sac instead of connecting to the stomach; and an esophageal fistula
    \u2013 an abnormal connection between the oesophagus and the trachea. \n\nBoth
    of these conditions usually occur together. \n\nThese are found in about 1 in
    3500 births. \n\nHalf of these cases may be part of a syndrome where other abnormalities
    are also present, particularly of the heart or limbs. \n\nThe other cases occur
    singly.\n\n\n=== Imaging ===\n\n\nAn X-ray of swallowed barium may be used to
    reveal the size and shape of the oesophagus, and the presence of any masses.
    \n\nThe oesophagus may also be imaged using a flexible camera inserted into the
    oesophagus, in a procedure called an endoscopy. \n\nIf an endoscopy is used on
    the stomach, the camera will also have to pass through the oesophagus. \n\nDuring
    an endoscopy, a biopsy may be taken. \n\nIf cancer of the oesophagus is being
    investigated, other methods, including a CT scan, may also be used.\n\n\n== History
    ==\n\nThe word oesophagus (British English: ooesophagus), comes from the Greek:
    \u03BF\u1F30\u03C3\u03BF\u03C6\u03AC\u03B3\u03BF\u03C2 (oisophagos) meaning gullet.
    \n\nIt derives from two roots (eosin) to carry and (phagos) to eat. \n\nThe use
    of the word ooesophagus, has been documented in anatomical literature since at
    least the time of Hippocrates, who noted that \"the ooesophagus ... receives
    the greatest amount of what we consume.\" \n\nIts existence in other animals
    and its relationship with the stomach was documented by the Roman naturalist
    Pliny the Elder (AD23\u2013AD79), and the peristaltic contractions of the oesophagus
    have been documented since at least the time of Galen.\n\nThe first attempt at
    surgery on the oesophagus focused in the neck, and was conducted in dogs by Theodore
    Billroth in 1871. \n\nIn 1877 Czerny carried out surgery in people. \n\nBy 1908,
    an operation had been performed by Voeckler to remove the oesophagus, and in
    1933 the first surgical removal of parts of the lower oesophagus, (to control
    esophageal cancer), had been conducted.\n\nThe Nissen fundoplication, in which
    the stomach is wrapped around the lower esophageal sphincter to stimulate its
    function and control reflux, was first conducted by Rudolph Nissen in 1955.\n\n\n==
    Other animals ==\n\n\n\n=== Vertebrates ===\n\nIn tetrapods, the pharynx is much
    shorter, and the oesophagus correspondingly longer, than in fish. \n\nIn the
    majority of vertebrates, the oesophagus is simply a connecting tube, but in some
    birds, which regurgitate components to feed their young, it is extended towards
    the lower end to form a crop for storing food before it enters the true stomach.
    \n\nIn ruminants, animals with four stomachs, a groove called the sulcus reticuli
    is often found in the oesophagus, allowing milk to drain directly into the hind
    stomach, the abomasum. \n\nIn the horse the oesophagus is about 1.2 to 1.5 m
    (4 to 5 ft) in length, and carries food to the stomach. \n\nA muscular ring,
    called the cardiac sphincter, connects the stomach to the oesophagus. \n\nThis
    sphincter is very well developed in horses. \n\nThis and the oblique angle at
    which the oesophagus connects to the stomach explains why horses cannot vomit.
    \n\nThe oesophagus is also the area of the digestive tract where horses may suffer
    from the condition known as choke.\n\nThe oesophagus of snakes is remarkable
    for the distension it undergoes when swallowing prey.In most fish, the oesophagus
    is extremely short, primarily due to the length of the pharynx (which is associated
    with the gills). \n\nHowever, some fish, including lampreys, chimaeras, and lungfish,
    have no true stomach, so that the oesophagus effectively runs from the pharynx
    directly to the intestine, and is therefore somewhat longer.\n\nIn many vertebrates,
    the oesophagus is lined by stratified squamous epithelium without glands. \n\nIn
    fish, the oesophagus is often lined with columnar epithelium, and in amphibians,
    sharks and rays, the esophageal epithelium is ciliated, helping to wash food
    along, in addition to the action of muscular peristalsis. \n\nIn addition, in
    the bat Plecotus auritus, fish and some amphibians, glands secreting pepsinogen
    or hydrochloric acid have been found.The muscle of the oesophagus in many mammals
    is initially striated but then becomes smooth muscle in the caudal third or so.
    \n\nIn canines and ruminants, however, it is entirely striated to allow regurgitation
    to feed young (canines) or regurgitation to chew cud (ruminants). \n\nIt is entirely
    smooth muscle in amphibians, reptiles and birds.\n\nContrary to popular belief,
    an adult human body would not be able to pass through the oesophagus of a whale,
    which generally measures less than 10 cm (4 in) in diameter, although in larger
    baleen whales it may be up to 25 cm (10 in) when fully distended.\n\n\n=== Invertebrates
    ===\n\nA structure with the same name is often found in invertebrates, including
    molluscs and arthropods, connecting the oral cavity with the stomach. \n\nIn
    terms of the digestive system of snails and slugs, the mouth opens into an oesophagus,
    which connects to the stomach. \n\nBecause of torsion, which is the rotation
    of the main body of the animal during larval development, the oesophagus usually
    passes around the stomach, and opens into its back, furthest from the mouth.
    \n\nIn species that have undergone de-torsion, however, the oesophagus may open
    into the anterior of the stomach, which is the reverse of the usual gastropod
    arrangement. \n\nThere is an extensive rostrum at the front of the oesophagus
    in all carnivorous snails and slugs. \n\nIn the freshwater snail species Tarebia
    granifera, the brood pouch is above the oesophagus.In the cephalopods, the brain
    often surrounds the oesophagus.\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oesophagus"

  descriptionText: "\n\nURETHRA\n\n\nThe urethra (from Greek \u03BF\u1F50\u03C1\u03AE\u03B8\u03C1\u03B1
    \u2013 our\u1E17thr\u0101) is a tube that connects the urinary bladder to the
    urinary meatus for the removal of urine from the body of both females and males.
    \n\nIn human females and other primates, the urethra connects to the urinary
    meatus above the vagina, whereas in marsupials, the female's urethra empties
    into the urogenital sinus.Females use their urethra only for urinating, but males
    use their urethra for both urination and ejaculation. \n\nThe external urethral
    sphincter is a striated muscle that allows voluntary control over urination.
    \n\nThe internal sphincter, formed by the involuntary smooth muscles lining the
    bladder neck and urethra, receives its nerve supply by the sympathetic division
    of the autonomic nervous system. \n\nThe internal sphincter is present both in
    males and females.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe urethra is a fibrous and muscular
    tube which connects the urinary bladder to the external urethral meatus. \n\nIts
    length differs between the sexes, because it passes through the penis in males.\n\n\n===
    Male ===\n\n\nIn the human male, the urethra is on average 18 to 20 centimetres
    (7.1 to 7.9 in) long and opens at the end of the external urethral meatus.The
    urethra is divided into four parts in men, named after the location:\nThere is
    inadequate data for the typical length of the male urethra; however, a study
    of 109 men showed an average length of 22.3 cm (SD = 2.4 cm), ranging from 15
    cm to 29 cm.\n\n\n=== Female ===\n\nIn the human female, the urethra is about
    4 cm long, and exits the body between the clitoris and the vagina, extending
    from the internal to the external urethral orifice. \n\nThe meatus is located
    below the clitoris. \n\nIt is placed behind the symphysis pubis, embedded in
    the anterior wall of the vagina, and its direction is obliquely downward and
    forward; it is slightly curved with the concavity directed forward. \n\nThe proximal
    two-thirds of the urethra is lined by transitional epithelial cells, while the
    distal third is lined by stratified squamous epithelial cells.Between the superior
    and inferior fascia of the urogenital diaphragm, the female urethra is surrounded
    by the urethral sphincter.\n\n\n=== Microanatomy ===\n\nThe cells lining the
    urethra (the epithelium) start off as transitional cells as it exits the bladder,
    which are variable layers of flat to cuboidal cells that change shape depending
    on whether they are compressed by the contents of the urethra. \n\nFurther along
    the urethra there are pseudostratified columnar and stratified columnar epithelia.
    \n\nThe lining becomes multiple layers of flat cells near the end of the urethra,
    which is the same as the external skin around it.There are small mucus-secreting
    urethral glands, as well as bulbo-urethral glands of Cowper, that secret mucous
    acting to lubricate the urethra.The urethra consists of three coats: muscular,
    erectile, and mucous, the muscular layer being a continuation of that of the
    bladder.\n\n\n=== Blood and nerve supply and lymphatics ===\n\nSomatic (conscious)
    innervation of the external urethral sphincter is supplied by the pudendal nerve.\n\n\n==
    Development ==\n\n\nIn the developing embryo, at the hind end lies a cloaca.
    \n\nThis, over the fourth to the seventh week, divides into a urogenital sinus
    and the beginnings of the anal canal, with a wall forming between these two inpouchings
    called the urorectal septum. \n\nThe urogenital sinus divides into three parts,
    with the middle part forming the urethra; the upper part is largest and becomes
    the urinary bladder, and the lower part then changes depending on the biological
    sex of the embryo. \n\nThe cells lining the urethra (the epithelium) come from
    endoderm, whereas the connective tissue and smooth muscle parts are derived from
    mesoderm.After the third month, urethra also contributes to the development of
    associated structures depending on the biological sex of the embryo. \n\nIn the
    male, the epithelium multiples to form the prostate. \n\nIn the female, the upper
    part of the urethra forms the urethra and paraurethral glands.\n\n\n== Function
    ==\n\n\n\n=== Urination ===\n\n\nThe urethra is the vessel through which urine
    passes after leaving the bladder. \n\nDuring urination, the smooth muscle lining
    the urethra relaxes in concert with bladder contraction(s) to forcefully expel
    the urine in a pressurized stream. \n\nFollowing this, the urethra re-establishes
    muscle tone by contracting the smooth muscle layer, and the bladder returns to
    a relaxed, quiescent state. \n\nUrethral smooth muscle cells are mechanically
    coupled to each other to coordinate mechanical force and electrical signaling
    in an organized, unitary fashion.\n\n\n=== Ejaculation ===\n\nThe male urethra
    is the conduit for semen during sexual intercourse. \n\nUrine is removed before
    ejaculation by pre-ejaculate fluid \u2013 called Cowper's fluid \u2013 from the
    bulbourethral gland.\n\n\n== Clinical significance ==\n\n\nInfection of the urethra
    is urethritis, which often causes purulent urethral discharge. \n\nIt is most
    often due to a sexually transmitted infection such as gonorrhoea or chlamydia,
    and less commonly due to other bacteria such as ureaplasma or mycoplasma; trichomonas
    vaginalis; or the viruses herpes simplex virus and adenovirus. \n\nInvestigations
    such as a gram stain of the discharge might reveal the cause; nucleic acid testing
    based on the first urine sample passed in a day, or a swab of the urethra sent
    for bacterial culture and sensitivity may also be used. \n\nTreatment usually
    involves antibiotics that treat both gonorrhoea and chlamydia, as these often
    occur together. \n\nA person being treated for urethritis should not have sex
    until the infection is treated, so that they do not spread the infection to others.
    \n\nBecause of this spread, which may occur during an incubation period before
    a person gets symptoms, there is often contact tracing so that sexual partners
    of an affected person can be found and treatment offered.Cancer can also develop
    in the lining of the urethra. \n\nWhen cancer is present, the most common symptom
    in an affected person is blood in the urine; a physical medical examination may
    be otherwise normal, except in late disease. \n\nCancer of the urethra is most
    often due to cancer of the cells lining the urethra, called transitional cell
    carcinoma, although it can more rarely occur as a squamous cell carcinoma if
    the type of cells lining the urethra have changed, such as due to a chronic schistosomiasis
    infection. \n\nInvestigations performed usually include collecting a sample of
    urine for an inspection for malignant cells under a microscope, called cytology,
    as well as examination with a flexible camera through the urethra, called urethroscopy.
    \n\nIf a malignancy is found, a biopsy will be taken, and a CT scan will be performed
    of other body parts (a CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis) to look for
    additional metastatic lesions. \n\nAfter the cancer is staged, treatment may
    involve chemotherapy.\n\n\n=== Injury ===\n\nPassage of kidney stones through
    the urethra can be painful. \n\nDamage to the urethra, such as by kidney stones,
    chronic infection, cancer, or from catheterisation, can lead to narrowing, called
    a urethral stricture. \n\nThe location and structure of the narrowing can be
    investigated with a medical imaging scan in which dye is injected through the
    urinary meatus into the urethra, called a retrograde urethrogram. \n\nAdditional
    forms of imaging, such as ultrasound, computed tomography and magnetic resonance
    imaging may also be used to provide further details.Injuries to the urethra (e.g.,
    from a pelvic fracture)\nForeign bodies in the urethra are uncommon, but there
    have been medical case reports of self-inflicted injuries, a result of insertion
    of foreign bodies into the urethra such as an electrical wire.\n\n\n=== Other
    ===\n\nHypospadias and epispadias are forms of abnormal development of the urethra
    in the male, where the meatus is not located at the distal end of the penis (it
    occurs lower than normal with hypospadias, and higher with epispadias). \n\nIn
    a severe chordee, the urethra can develop between the penis and the scrotum.\n\n\n===
    Catheterisation ===\n\nA tube called a catheter can be inserted through the urethra
    to drain urine from the bladder, called an indwelling urinary catheter; or, to
    bypass the urethra, a catheter may be directly inserted through the abdominal
    wall into the bladder, called a suprapubic catheter. \n\nThis may be to relieve
    or bypass an obstruction, to monitor how much urine someone produces, or because
    a person has difficulty urinating, for example due to a neurological cause such
    as multiple sclerosis. \n\nComplications that are associated with catheter insertion
    can include catheter-associated infections, injury to the urethra or nearby structures,
    or pain.\n\n\n== Other animals ==\n\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe word \"urethra\"
    comes from the Ancient Greek stem \"uro\" relating to urination, with the structure
    described as early as the time of Hippocrates. \n\nConfusingly however, at the
    time it was called \"ureter\". \n\nThereafter, terms \"ureter\" and \"urethra\"
    were variably used to refer to each other thereafter for more than a millennia.
    \n\nIt was only in the 1550s that anatomists such as Bartolomeo Eustacchio and
    Jacques Dubois began to use the terms to specifically and consistently refer
    to what is in modern English called the ureter and the urethra. \n\nFollowing
    this, in the 19th and 20th centuries multiple terms relating to the structures
    such as urethritis and urethrography, were coined.Kidney stones have been identified
    and recorded about as long as written historical records exist. \n\nThe urinary
    tract as well as its function to drain urine from the kidneys, has been described
    by Galen in the second century AD. \n\nSurgery to the urethra to remove kidney
    stones has been described since at least the first century AD by Aulus Cornelius
    Celsus.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urethra"

  descriptionText: "\n\nKIDNEY\n\n\nThe kidneys are two reddish-brown bean-shaped
    organs found in vertebrates. \n\nThey are located on the left and right in the
    retroperitoneal space, and in adult humans are about 12 centimetres (4+1\u20442
    inches) in length. \n\nThey receive blood from the paired renal arteries; blood
    exits into the paired renal veins. \n\nEach kidney is attached to a ureter, a
    tube that carries excreted urine to the bladder.\n\nThe kidney participates in
    the control of the volume of various body fluids, fluid osmolality, acid\u2013base
    balance, various electrolyte concentrations, and removal of toxins. \n\nFiltration
    occurs in the glomerulus: one-fifth of the blood volume that enters the kidneys
    is filtered. \n\nExamples of substances reabsorbed are solute-free water, sodium,
    bicarbonate, glucose, and amino acids. \n\nExamples of substances secreted are
    hydrogen, ammonium, potassium and uric acid. \n\nThe kidneys also carry out functions
    independent of the nephron. \n\nFor example, they convert a precursor of vitamin
    D to its active form, calcitriol; and synthesize the hormones erythropoietin
    and renin. \n\nThe nephron is the structural and functional unit of the kidney.
    \n\nEach adult human kidney contains around 1 million nephrons, while a mouse
    kidney contains only about 12,500 nephrons.\n\nProcedures used in the management
    of kidney disease include chemical and microscopic examination of the urine (urinalysis),
    measurement of kidney function by calculating the estimated glomerular filtration
    rate (eGFR) using the serum creatinine; and kidney biopsy and CT scan to evaluate
    for abnormal anatomy. \n\nDialysis and kidney transplantation are used to treat
    kidney failure; one (or both sequentially) of these are almost always used when
    renal function drops below 15%. \n\nNephrectomy is frequently used to cure renal
    cell carcinoma.\nRenal physiology is the study of kidney function. \n\nNephrology
    is the medical specialty which addresses diseases of kidney function: these include
    chronic kidney disease, nephritic and nephrotic syndromes, acute kidney injury,
    and pyelonephritis. \n\nUrology addresses diseases of kidney (and urinary tract)
    anatomy: these include cancer, renal cysts, kidney stones and ureteral stones,
    and urinary tract obstruction. \n\nThe word \u201Crenal\u201D is an adjective
    meaning \u201Crelating to the kidneys\u201D, and its roots are French or late
    Latin. \n\nWhereas according to some opinions, \"renal\" should be replaced with
    \"kidney\" in scientific writings such as \"kidney artery\", other experts have
    advocated preserving the use of renal as appropriate including in \"renal artery\".\n\n\n==
    Structure ==\n\n\nIn humans, the kidneys are located high in the abdominal cavity,
    one on each side of the spine, and lie in a retroperitoneal position at a slightly
    oblique angle. \n\nThe asymmetry within the abdominal cavity, caused by the position
    of the liver, typically results in the right kidney being slightly lower and
    smaller than the left, and being placed slightly more to the middle than the
    left kidney. \n\nThe left kidney is approximately at the vertebral level T12
    to L3, and the right is slightly lower. \n\nThe right kidney sits just below
    the diaphragm and posterior to the liver. \n\nThe left kidney sits below the
    diaphragm and posterior to the spleen. \n\nOn top of each kidney is an adrenal
    gland. \n\nThe upper parts of the kidneys are partially protected by the 11th
    and 12th ribs. \n\nEach kidney, with its adrenal gland is surrounded by two layers
    of fat: the perirenal fat present between renal fascia and renal capsule and
    pararenal fat superior to the renal fascia.\n\nThe kidney is a bean-shaped structure
    with a convex and a concave border. \n\nA recessed area on the concave border
    is the renal hilum, where the renal artery enters the kidney and the renal vein
    and ureter leave. \n\nThe kidney is surrounded by tough fibrous tissue, the renal
    capsule, which is itself surrounded by perirenal fat, renal fascia, and pararenal
    fat. \n\nThe anterior (front) surface of these tissues is the peritoneum, while
    the posterior (rear) surface is the transversalis fascia.\n\nThe superior pole
    of the right kidney is adjacent to the liver. \n\nFor the left kidney, it is
    next to the spleen. \n\nBoth, therefore, move down upon inhalation.\n\nA Danish
    study measured the median renal length to be 11.2 cm (4+7\u204416 in) on the
    left side and 10.9 cm (4+5\u204416 in) on the right side in adults. \n\nMedian
    renal volumes were 146 cm3 (8+15\u204416 cu in) on the left and 134 cm3 (8+3\u204416
    cu in) on the right.\n\n\n=== Gross anatomy ===\n\n\nThe functional substance,
    or parenchyma, of the kidney is divided into two major structures: the outer
    renal cortex and the inner renal medulla. \n\nGrossly, these structures take
    the shape of eight to 18 cone-shaped renal lobes, each containing renal cortex
    surrounding a portion of medulla called a renal pyramid. \n\nBetween the renal
    pyramids are projections of cortex called renal columns. \n\nNephrons, the urine-producing
    functional structures of the kidney, span the cortex and medulla. \n\nThe initial
    filtering portion of a nephron is the renal corpuscle, which is located in the
    cortex. \n\nThis is followed by a renal tubule that passes from the cortex deep
    into the medullary pyramids. \n\nPart of the renal cortex, a medullary ray is
    a collection of renal tubules that drain into a single collecting duct.\n\nThe
    tip, or papilla, of each pyramid empties urine into a minor calyx; minor calyces
    empty into major calyces, and major calyces empty into the renal pelvis. \n\nThis
    becomes the ureter. \n\nAt the hilum, the ureter and renal vein exit the kidney
    and the renal artery enters. \n\nHilar fat and lymphatic tissue with lymph nodes
    surround these structures. \n\nThe hilar fat is contiguous with a fat-filled
    cavity called the renal sinus. \n\nThe renal sinus collectively contains the
    renal pelvis and calyces and separates these structures from the renal medullary
    tissue.The kidneys possess no overtly moving structures.\n\n\n\n=== Blood supply
    ===\n\n\nThe kidneys receive blood from the renal arteries, left and right, which
    branch directly from the abdominal aorta. \n\nDespite their relatively small
    size, the kidneys receive approximately 20% of the cardiac output. \n\nEach renal
    artery branches into segmental arteries, dividing further into interlobar arteries,
    which penetrate the renal capsule and extend through the renal columns between
    the renal pyramids. \n\nThe interlobar arteries then supply blood to the arcuate
    arteries that run through the boundary of the cortex and the medulla. \n\nEach
    arcuate artery supplies several interlobular arteries that feed into the afferent
    arterioles that supply the glomeruli.\n\nBlood drains from the kidneys, ultimately
    into the inferior vena cava. \n\nAfter filtration occurs, the blood moves through
    a small network of small veins (venules) that converge into interlobular veins.
    \n\nAs with the arteriole distribution, the veins follow the same pattern: the
    interlobular provide blood to the arcuate veins then back to the interlobar veins,
    which come to form the renal veins which exiting the kidney .\n\n\n=== Nerve
    supply ===\n\nThe kidney and nervous system communicate via the renal plexus,
    whose fibers course along the renal arteries to reach each kidney. \n\nInput
    from the sympathetic nervous system triggers vasoconstriction in the kidney,
    thereby reducing renal blood flow. \n\nThe kidney also receives input from the
    parasympathetic nervous system, by way of the renal branches of the vagus nerve;
    the function of this is yet unclear. \n\nSensory input from the kidney travels
    to the T10-11 levels of the spinal cord and is sensed in the corresponding dermatome.
    \n\nThus, pain in the flank region may be referred from corresponding kidney.\n\n\n===
    Microanatomy ===\n\nRenal histology is the study of the microscopic structure
    of the kidney. \n\nDistinct cell types include:\n\nKidney glomerulus parietal
    cell\nKidney glomerulus podocyte\nKidney proximal tubule brush border cell\nLoop
    of Henle thin segment cell\nThick ascending limb cell\nKidney distal tubule cell\nCollecting
    duct principal cell\nCollecting duct intercalated cell\nInterstitial kidney cells\n\n\n===
    Gene and protein expression ===\n\n\nAbout 20,000 protein coding genes are expressed
    in human cells and almost 70% of these genes are expressed in normal, adult kidneys.
    \n\nJust over 300 genes are more specifically expressed in the kidney, with only
    some 50 genes being highly specific for the kidney. \n\nMany of the corresponding
    kidney specific proteins are expressed in the cell membrane and function as transporter
    proteins. \n\nThe highest expressed kidney specific protein is uromodulin, the
    most abundant protein in urine with functions that prevent calcification and
    growth of bacteria. \n\nSpecific proteins are expressed in the different compartments
    of the kidney with podocin and nephrin expressed in glomeruli, Solute carrier
    family protein SLC22A8 expressed in proximal tubules, calbindin expressed in
    distal tubules and aquaporin 2 expressed in the collecting duct cells.\n\n\n===
    Development ===\n\n\nThe mammalian kidney develops from intermediate mesoderm.
    \n\nKidney development, also called nephrogenesis, proceeds through a series
    of three successive developmental phases: the pronephros, mesonephros, and metanephros.
    \n\nThe metanephros are primordia of the permanent kidney.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\n\nThe
    kidneys excrete a variety of waste products produced by metabolism into the urine.
    \n\nThe microscopic structural and functional unit of the kidney is the nephron.
    \n\nIt processes the blood supplied to it via filtration, reabsorption, secretion
    and excretion; the consequence of those processes is the production of urine.
    \n\nThese include the nitrogenous wastes urea, from protein catabolism, and uric
    acid, from nucleic acid metabolism. \n\nThe ability of mammals and some birds
    to concentrate wastes into a volume of urine much smaller than the volume of
    blood from which the wastes were extracted is dependent on an elaborate countercurrent
    multiplication mechanism. \n\nThis requires several independent nephron characteristics
    to operate: a tight hairpin configuration of the tubules, water and ion permeability
    in the descending limb of the loop, water impermeability in the ascending loop,
    and active ion transport out of most of the ascending limb. \n\nIn addition,
    passive countercurrent exchange by the vessels carrying the blood supply to the
    nephron is essential for enabling this function.\n\nThe kidney participates in
    whole-body homeostasis, regulating acid\u2013base balance, electrolyte concentrations,
    extracellular fluid volume, and blood pressure. \n\nThe kidney accomplishes these
    homeostatic functions both independently and in concert with other organs, particularly
    those of the endocrine system. \n\nVarious endocrine hormones coordinate these
    endocrine functions; these include renin, angiotensin II, aldosterone, antidiuretic
    hormone, and atrial natriuretic peptide, among others.\n\n\n=== Formation of
    urine ===\n\n\n\n==== Filtration ====\n\nFiltration, which takes place at the
    renal corpuscle, is the process by which cells and large proteins are retained
    while materials of smaller molecular weights are filtered from the blood to make
    an ultrafiltrate that eventually becomes urine. \n\nThe kidney generates 180
    liters of filtrate a day. \n\nThe process is also known as hydrostatic filtration
    due to the hydrostatic pressure exerted on the capillary walls.\n\n\n==== Reabsorption
    ====\n\nReabsorption is the transport of molecules from this ultrafiltrate and
    into the peritubular capillary. \n\nIt is accomplished via selective receptors
    on the luminal cell membrane. \n\nWater is 55% reabsorbed in the proximal tubule.
    \n\nGlucose at normal plasma levels is completely reabsorbed in the proximal
    tubule. \n\nThe mechanism for this is the Na+/glucose cotransporter. \n\nA plasma
    level of 350 mg/dL will fully saturate the transporters and glucose will be lost
    in the urine. \n\nA plasma glucose level of approximately 160 is sufficient to
    allow glucosuria, which is an important clinical clue to diabetes mellitus.\nAmino
    acids are reabsorbed by sodium dependent transporters in the proximal tubule.
    \n\nHartnup disease is a deficiency of the tryptophan amino acid transporter,
    which results in pellagra.\n\n\n==== Secretion ====\n\nSecretion is the reverse
    of reabsorption: molecules are transported from the peritubular capillary through
    the interstitial fluid, then through the renal tubular cell and into the ultrafiltrate.\n\n\n====
    Excretion ====\n\nThe last step in the processing of the ultrafiltrate is excretion:
    the ultrafiltrate passes out of the nephron and travels through a tube called
    the collecting duct, which is part of the collecting duct system, and then to
    the ureters where it is renamed urine. \n\nIn addition to transporting the ultrafiltrate,
    the collecting duct also takes part in reabsorption.\n\n\n=== Hormone secretion
    ===\n\nThe kidneys secrete a variety of hormones, including erythropoietin, calcitriol,
    and renin. \n\nErythropoietin is released in response to hypoxia (low levels
    of oxygen at tissue level) in the renal circulation. \n\nIt stimulates erythropoiesis
    (production of red blood cells) in the bone marrow. \n\nCalcitriol, the activated
    form of vitamin D, promotes intestinal absorption of calcium and the renal reabsorption
    of phosphate. \n\nRenin is an enzyme which regulates angiotensin and aldosterone
    levels.\n\n\n=== Blood pressure regulation ===\n\n\nAlthough the kidney cannot
    directly sense blood, long-term regulation of blood pressure predominantly depends
    upon the kidney. \n\nThis primarily occurs through maintenance of the extracellular
    fluid compartment, the size of which depends on the plasma sodium concentration.
    \n\nRenin is the first in a series of important chemical messengers that make
    up the renin\u2013angiotensin system. \n\nChanges in renin ultimately alter the
    output of this system, principally the hormones angiotensin II and aldosterone.
    \n\nEach hormone acts via multiple mechanisms, but both increase the kidney's
    absorption of sodium chloride, thereby expanding the extracellular fluid compartment
    and raising blood pressure. \n\nWhen renin levels are elevated, the concentrations
    of angiotensin II and aldosterone increase, leading to increased sodium chloride
    reabsorption, expansion of the extracellular fluid compartment, and an increase
    in blood pressure. \n\nConversely, when renin levels are low, angiotensin II
    and aldosterone levels decrease, contracting the extracellular fluid compartment,
    and decreasing blood pressure.\n\n\n=== Acid\u2013base balance ===\n\n\nTwo organ
    systems, the kidneys and lungs, maintain acid\u2013base homeostasis, which is
    the maintenance of pH around a relatively stable value. \n\nThe lungs contribute
    to acid\u2013base homeostasis by regulating carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration.
    \n\nThe kidneys have two very important roles in maintaining the acid\u2013base
    balance: to reabsorb and regenerate bicarbonate from urine, and to excrete hydrogen
    ions and fixed acids (anions of acids) into urine.\n\n\n=== Regulation of osmolality
    ===\n\nThe kidneys help maintain the water and salt level of the body. \n\nAny
    significant rise in plasma osmolality is detected by the hypothalamus, which
    communicates directly with the posterior pituitary gland. \n\nAn increase in
    osmolality causes the gland to secrete antidiuretic hormone (ADH), resulting
    in water reabsorption by the kidney and an increase in urine concentration. \n\nThe
    two factors work together to return the plasma osmolality to its normal levels.\n\n\n===
    Measuring function ===\n\n\nVarious calculations and methods are used to try
    to measure kidney function. \n\nRenal clearance is the volume of plasma from
    which the substance is completely cleared from the blood per unit time. \n\nThe
    filtration fraction is the amount of plasma that is actually filtered through
    the kidney. \n\nThis can be defined using the equation. \n\nThe kidney is a very
    complex organ and mathematical modelling has been used to better understand kidney
    function at several scales, including fluid uptake and secretion.\n\n\n== Clinical
    significance ==\n\n\nNephrology is the subspeciality under Internal Medicine
    that deals with kidney function and disease states related to renal malfunction
    and their management including dialysis and kidney transplantation. \n\nUrology
    is the specialty under Surgery that deals with kidney structure abnormalities
    such as kidney cancer and cysts and problems with urinary tract. \n\nNephrologists
    are internists, and urologists are surgeons, whereas both are often called \"kidney
    doctors\". \n\nThere are overlapping areas that both nephrologists and urologists
    can provide care such as kidney stones and kidney related infections.\nThere
    are many causes of kidney disease. \n\nSome causes are acquired over the course
    of life, such as diabetic nephropathy whereas others are congenital, such as
    polycystic kidney disease.\n\nMedical terms related to the kidneys commonly use
    terms such as renal and the prefix nephro-. \n\nThe adjective renal, meaning
    related to the kidney, is from the Latin r\u0113n\u0113s, meaning kidneys; the
    prefix nephro- is from the Ancient Greek word for kidney, nephros (\u03BD\u03B5\u03C6\u03C1\u03CC\u03C2).
    \n\nFor example, surgical removal of the kidney is a nephrectomy, while a reduction
    in kidney function is called renal dysfunction.\n\n\n=== Acquired ===\n\nDiabetic
    nephropathy\nGlomerulonephritis\nHydronephrosis is the enlargement of one or
    both of the kidneys caused by obstruction of the flow of urine.\nInterstitial
    nephritis\nKidney stones (nephrolithiasis) are a relatively common and particularly
    painful disorder. \n\nA chronic condition can result in scars to the kidneys.
    \n\nThe removal of kidney stones involves ultrasound treatment to break up the
    stones into smaller pieces, which are then passed through the urinary tract.
    \n\nOne common symptom of kidney stones is a sharp to disabling pain in the middle
    and sides of the lower back or groin.\nKidney tumour\nWilms tumor\nRenal cell
    carcinoma\nLupus nephritis\nMinimal change disease\nIn nephrotic syndrome, the
    glomerulus has been damaged so that a large amount of protein in the blood enters
    the urine. \n\nOther frequent features of the nephrotic syndrome include swelling,
    low serum albumin, and high cholesterol.\n\nPyelonephritis is infection of the
    kidneys and is frequently caused by complication of a urinary tract infection.\nKidney
    failure\nAcute kidney failure\nStage 5 Chronic Kidney Disease\nRenal artery stenosis\nRenovascular
    hypertension\n\n\n=== Kidney injury and failure ===\n\n\nGenerally, humans can
    live normally with just one kidney, as one has more functioning renal tissue
    than is needed to survive. \n\nOnly when the amount of functioning kidney tissue
    is greatly diminished does one develop chronic kidney disease. \n\nRenal replacement
    therapy, in the form of dialysis or kidney transplantation, is indicated when
    the glomerular filtration rate has fallen very low or if the renal dysfunction
    leads to severe symptoms.\n\n\n=== Dialysis ===\n\n\nDialysis is a treatment
    that substitutes for the function of normal kidneys. \n\nDialysis may be instituted
    when approximately 85%-90% of kidney function is lost, as indicated by a glomerular
    filtration rate (GFR) of less than 15. \n\nDialysis removes metabolic waste products
    as well as excess water and sodium (thereby contributing to regulating blood
    pressure); and maintains many chemical levels within the body. \n\nLife expectancy
    is 5\u201310 years for those on dialysis; some live up to 30 years. \n\nDialysis
    can occur via the blood (through a catheter or arteriovenous fistula), or through
    the peritoneum (peritoneal dialysis) Dialysis is typically administered three
    times a week for several hours at free-standing dialysis centers, allowing recipients
    to lead an otherwise essentially normal life.\n\n\n=== Congenital disease ===\n\nCongenital
    hydronephrosis\nCongenital obstruction of urinary tract\nDuplex kidneys, or double
    kidneys, occur in approximately 1% of the population. \n\nThis occurrence normally
    causes no complications, but can occasionally cause urinary tract infections.\nDuplicated
    ureter occurs in approximately one in 100 live births\nHorseshoe kidney occurs
    in approximately one in 400 live births\nNephroblastoma (Syndromic Wilm's tumour)\nNutcracker
    syndrome\nPolycystic kidney disease\nAutosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease
    afflicts patients later in life. \n\nApproximately one in 1000 people will develop
    this condition\nAutosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease is far less common,
    but more severe, than the dominant condition. \n\nIt is apparent in utero or
    at birth.\nRenal agenesis. \n\nFailure of one kidney to form occurs in approximately
    one in 750 live births. \n\nFailure of both kidneys to form used to be fatal;
    however, medical advances such as amnioinfusion therapy during pregnancy and
    peritoneal dialysis have made it possible to stay alive until a transplant can
    occur.\nRenal dysplasia\nUnilateral small kidney\nMulticystic dysplastic kidney
    occurs in approximately one in every 2400 live births\nUreteropelvic Junction
    Obstruction or UPJO; although most cases are congenital, some are acquired.\n\n\n===
    Diagnosis ===\n\nMany renal diseases are diagnosed on the basis of a detailed
    medical history, and physical examination. \n\nThe medical history takes into
    account present and past symptoms, especially those of kidney disease; recent
    infections; exposure to substances toxic to the kidney; and family history of
    kidney disease.\nKidney function is tested by using blood tests and urine tests.
    \n\nThe most common blood test are creatinine, urea and electrolytes. \n\nUrine
    tests such as urinalysis can evaluate for pH, protein, glucose, and the presence
    of blood. \n\nMicroscopic analysis can also identify the presence of urinary
    casts and crystals. \n\nThe glomerular filtration rate (GFR) can be directly
    measured (\"measured GFR\", or mGFR) but this rarely done in everyday practice.
    \n\nInstead, special equations are used to calculate GFR (\"estimated GFR\",
    or eGFR).\n\n\n==== Imaging ====\n\nRenal ultrasonography is essential in the
    diagnosis and management of kidney-related diseases. \n\nOther modalities, such
    as CT and MRI, should always be considered as supplementary imaging modalities
    in the assessment of renal disease.\n\n\n==== Biopsy ====\n\nThe role of the
    renal biopsy is to diagnose renal disease in which the etiology is not clear
    based upon noninvasive means (clinical history, past medical history, medication
    history, physical exam, laboratory studies, imaging studies). \n\nIn general,
    a renal pathologist will perform a detailed morphological evaluation and integrate
    the morphologic findings with the clinical history and laboratory data, ultimately
    arriving at a pathological diagnosis. \n\nA renal pathologist is a physician
    who has undergone general training in anatomic pathology and additional specially
    training in the interpretation of renal biopsy specimens.\n\nIdeally, multiple
    core sections are obtained and evaluated for adequacy (presence of glomeruli)
    intraoperatively. \n\nA pathologist/pathology assistant divides the specimen(s)
    for submission for light microscopy, immunofluorescence microscopy and electron
    microscopy.\n\nThe pathologist will examine the specimen using light microscopy
    with multiple staining techniques (hematoxylin and eosin/H&E, PAS, trichrome,
    silver stain) on multiple level sections. \n\nMultiple immunofluorescence stains
    are performed to evaluate for antibody, protein and complement deposition. \n\nFinally,
    ultra-structural examination is performed with electron microscopy and may reveal
    the presence of electron-dense deposits or other characteristic abnormalities
    that may suggest an etiology for the patient's renal disease.\n\n\n== Other animals
    ==\n\nIn the majority of vertebrates, the mesonephros persists into the adult,
    albeit usually fused with the more advanced metanephros; only in amniotes is
    the mesonephros restricted to the embryo. \n\nThe kidneys of fish and amphibians
    are typically narrow, elongated organs, occupying a significant portion of the
    trunk. \n\nThe collecting ducts from each cluster of nephrons usually drain into
    an archinephric duct, which is homologous with the vas deferens of amniotes.
    \n\nHowever, the situation is not always so simple; in cartilaginous fish and
    some amphibians, there is also a shorter duct, similar to the amniote ureter,
    which drains the posterior (metanephric) parts of the kidney, and joins with
    the archinephric duct at the bladder or cloaca. \n\nIndeed, in many cartilaginous
    fish, the anterior portion of the kidney may degenerate or cease to function
    altogether in the adult.In the most primitive vertebrates, the hagfish and lampreys,
    the kidney is unusually simple: it consists of a row of nephrons, each emptying
    directly into the archinephric duct. \n\nInvertebrates may possess excretory
    organs that are sometimes referred to as \"kidneys\", but, even in Amphioxus,
    these are never homologous with the kidneys of vertebrates, and are more accurately
    referred to by other names, such as nephridia. \n\nIn amphibians, kidneys and
    the urinary bladder harbour specialized parasites, monogeneans of the family
    Polystomatidae.The kidneys of reptiles consist of a number of lobules arranged
    in a broadly linear pattern. \n\nEach lobule contains a single branch of the
    ureter in its centre, into which the collecting ducts empty. \n\nReptiles have
    relatively few nephrons compared with other amniotes of a similar size, possibly
    because of their lower metabolic rate.Birds have relatively large, elongated
    kidneys, each of which is divided into three or more distinct lobes. \n\nThe
    lobes consists of several small, irregularly arranged, lobules, each centred
    on a branch of the ureter. \n\nBirds have small glomeruli, but about twice as
    many nephrons as similarly sized mammals.The human kidney is fairly typical of
    that of mammals. \n\nDistinctive features of the mammalian kidney, in comparison
    with that of other vertebrates, include the presence of the renal pelvis and
    renal pyramids and a clearly distinguishable cortex and medulla. \n\nThe latter
    feature is due to the presence of elongated loops of Henle; these are much shorter
    in birds, and not truly present in other vertebrates (although the nephron often
    has a short intermediate segment between the convoluted tubules). \n\nIt is only
    in mammals that the kidney takes on its classical \"kidney\" shape, although
    there are some exceptions, such as the multilobed reniculate kidneys of pinnipeds
    and cetaceans.\n\n\n=== Evolutionary adaptation ===\n\nKidneys of various animals
    show evidence of evolutionary adaptation and have long been studied in ecophysiology
    and comparative physiology. \n\nKidney morphology, often indexed as the relative
    medullary thickness, is associated with habitat aridity among species of mammals
    and diet (e.g., carnivores have only long loops of Henle).\n\n\n== Society and
    culture ==\n\n\n\n=== Significance ===\n\n\n\n==== Egyptian ====\n\nIn ancient
    Egypt, the kidneys, like the heart, were left inside the mummified bodies, unlike
    other organs which were removed. \n\nComparing this to the biblical statements,
    and to drawings of human body with the heart and two kidneys portraying a set
    of scales for weighing justice, it seems that the Egyptian beliefs had also connected
    the kidneys with judgement and perhaps with moral decisions.\n\n\n==== Hebrew
    ====\n\nAccording to studies in modern and ancient Hebrew, various body organs
    in humans and animals served also an emotional or logical role, today mostly
    attributed to the brain and the endocrine system. \n\nThe kidney is mentioned
    in several biblical verses in conjunction with the heart, much as the bowels
    were understood to be the \"seat\" of emotion \u2013 grief, joy and pain. \n\nSimilarly,
    the Talmud (Berakhoth 61.a) states that one of the two kidneys counsels what
    is good, and the other evil.\nIn the sacrifices offered at the biblical Tabernacle
    and later on at the temple in Jerusalem, the priests were instructed to remove
    the kidneys and the adrenal gland covering the kidneys of the sheep, goat and
    cattle offerings, and to burn them on the altar, as the holy part of the \"offering
    for God\" never to be eaten.\n\n\n==== India: Ayurvedic system ====\n\nIn ancient
    India, according to the Ayurvedic medical systems, the kidneys were considered
    the beginning of the excursion channels system, the 'head' of the Mutra Srotas,
    receiving from all other systems, and therefore important in determining a person's
    health balance and temperament by the balance and mixture of the three 'Dosha's
    \u2013 the three health elements: Vatha (or Vata) \u2013 air, Pitta \u2013 bile,
    and Kapha \u2013 mucus. \n\nThe temperament and health of a person can then be
    seen in the resulting color of the urine.Modern Ayurveda practitioners, a practice
    which is characterized as pseudoscience, have attempted to revive these methods
    in medical procedures as part of Ayurveda Urine therapy. \n\nThese procedures
    have been called \"nonsensical\" by skeptics.\n\n\n==== Medieval Christianity
    ====\n\nThe Latin term renes is related to the English word \"reins\", a synonym
    for the kidneys in Shakespearean English (e.g. \n\nMerry Wives of Windsor 3.5),
    which was also the time when the King James Version of the Bible was translated.
    \n\nKidneys were once popularly regarded as the seat of the conscience and reflection,
    and a number of verses in the Bible (e.g. \n\nPs. 7:9, Rev. 2:23) state that
    God searches out and inspects the kidneys, or \"reins\", of humans, together
    with the heart.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nKidney stones have been identified and
    recorded about as long as written historical records exist. \n\nThe urinary tract
    including the ureters, as well as their function to drain urine from the kidneys,
    has been described by Galen in the second century AD.The first to examine the
    ureter through an internal approach, called ureteroscopy, rather than surgery
    was Hampton Young in 1929. \n\nThis was improved on by VF Marshall who is the
    first published use of a flexible endoscope based on fiber optics, which occurred
    in 1964. \n\nThe insertion of a drainage tube into the renal pelvis, bypassing
    the uterers and urinary tract, called nephrostomy, was first described in 1941.
    \n\nSuch an approach differed greatly from the open surgical approaches within
    the urinary system employed during the preceding two millennia.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"

  descriptionText: "\n\nLIVER\n\n\nThe liver is an organ of the digestive system
    only found in vertebrates which detoxifies various metabolites, synthesizes proteins
    and produces biochemicals necessary for digestion and growth. \n\nIn humans,
    it is located in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen, below the diaphragm.
    \n\nIts other roles in metabolism include the regulation of glycogen storage,
    decomposition of red blood cells, and the production of hormones.\n\nThe liver
    is an accessory digestive organ that produces bile, an alkaline fluid containing
    cholesterol and bile acids, which helps the breakdown of fat. \n\nThe gallbladder,
    a small pouch that sits just under the liver, stores bile produced by the liver
    which is afterwards moved to the small intestine to complete digestion. \n\nThe
    liver's highly specialized tissue, consisting of mostly hepatocytes, regulates
    a wide variety of high-volume biochemical reactions, including the synthesis
    and breakdown of small and complex molecules, many of which are necessary for
    normal vital functions. \n\nEstimates regarding the organ's total number of functions
    vary, but textbooks generally cite it being around 500.\n\nIt is not known how
    to compensate for the absence of liver function in the long term, although liver
    dialysis techniques can be used in the short term. \n\nArtificial livers have
    not been developed to promote long-term replacement in the absence of the liver.
    \n\nAs of 2018, liver transplantation is the only option for complete liver failure.\n\n\n==
    Structure ==\n\nThe liver is a reddish-brown, wedge-shaped organ with two\nlobes
    of unequal size and shape. \n\nA human liver normally weighs approximately 1.5
    kg (3.3 lb) and has a width of about 15 cm (6 in). \n\nThere is considerable
    size variation between individuals, with the standard reference range for men
    being 970\u20131,860 g (2.14\u20134.10 lb) and for women 600\u20131,770 g (1.32\u20133.90
    lb). \n\nIt is both the heaviest internal organ and the largest gland in the
    human body.\n\nLocated in the right upper quadrant of the abdominal cavity, it
    rests just below the diaphragm, to the right of the stomach and overlies the
    gallbladder.\n\nThe liver is connected to two large blood vessels: the hepatic
    artery and the portal vein. \n\nThe hepatic artery carries oxygen-rich blood
    from the aorta via the celiac trunk, whereas the portal vein carries blood rich
    in digested nutrients from the entire gastrointestinal tract and also from the
    spleen and pancreas. \n\nThese blood vessels subdivide into small capillaries
    known as liver sinusoids, which then lead to lobules.\nLobules are the functional
    units of the liver. \n\nEach lobule is made up of millions of hepatic cells (hepatocytes),
    which are the basic metabolic cells. \n\nThe lobules are held together by a fine,
    dense, irregular, fibroelastic connective tissue layer extending from the fibrous
    capsule covering the entire liver known as Glisson's capsule. \n\nThis extends
    into the structure of the liver by accompanying the blood vessels, ducts, and
    nerves at the hepatic hilum. \n\nThe whole surface of the liver, except for the
    bare area, is covered in a serous coat derived from the peritoneum, and this
    firmly adheres to the inner Glisson's capsule.\n\n\n=== Gross anatomy ===\n\nTerminology
    related to the liver often starts in hepat- from \u1F21\u03C0\u03B1\u03C4\u03BF-,
    from the Greek word for liver.\n\n\n==== Lobes ====\n\nThe liver is grossly divided
    into two parts when viewed from above \u2013 a right and a left lobe - and four
    parts when viewed from below (left, right, caudate, and quadrate lobes).\n\nThe
    falciform ligament makes a superficial division of the liver into a left and
    right lobe. \n\nFrom below, the two additional lobes are located between the
    right and left lobes, one in front of the other. \n\nA line can be imagined running
    from the left of the vena cava and all the way forward to divide the liver and
    gallbladder into two halves. \n\nThis line is called Cantlie's line.\n\nOther
    anatomical landmarks include the ligamentum venosum and the round ligament of
    the liver, which further divide the left side of the liver in two sections. \n\nAn
    important anatomical landmark, the porta hepatis, divides this left portion into
    four segments, which can be numbered starting at the caudate lobe as I in an
    anticlockwise manner. \n\nFrom this parietal view, seven segments can be seen,
    because the eighth segment is only visible in the visceral view.\n\n\n==== Surfaces
    ====\n\nOn the diaphragmatic surface, apart from a triangular bare area where
    it connects to the diaphragm, the liver is covered by a thin, double-layered
    membrane, the peritoneum, that helps to reduce friction against other organs.
    \n\nThis surface covers the convex shape of the two lobes where it accommodates
    the shape of the diaphragm. \n\nThe peritoneum folds back on itself to form the
    falciform ligament and the right and left triangular ligaments.\n\nThese peritoneal
    ligaments are not related to the anatomic ligaments in joints, and the right
    and left triangular ligaments have no known functional importance, though they
    serve as surface landmarks. \n\nThe falciform ligament functions to attach the
    liver to the posterior portion of the anterior body wall.\n\nThe visceral surface
    or inferior surface is uneven and concave. \n\nIt is covered in peritoneum apart
    from where it attaches the gallbladder and the porta hepatis. \n\nThe fossa of
    gall bladder lies to the right of the quadrate lobe, occupied by the gallbladder
    with its cystic duct close to the right end of porta hepatis.\n\n\n==== Impressions
    ====\n\nSeveral impressions on the surface of the liver accommodate the various
    adjacent structures and organs. \n\nUnderneath the right lobe and to the right
    of the gallbladder fossa are two impressions, one behind the other and separated
    by a ridge. \n\nThe one in front is a shallow colic impression, formed by the
    hepatic flexure and the one behind is a deeper renal impression accommodating
    part of the right kidney and part of the suprarenal gland.\n\nThe suprarenal
    impression is a small, triangular, depressed area on the liver. \n\nIt is located
    close to the right of the fossa, between the bare area and the caudate lobe,
    and immediately above the renal impression. \n\nThe greater part of the suprarenal
    impression is devoid of peritoneum and it lodges the right suprarenal gland.Medial
    to the renal impression is a third and slightly marked impression, lying between
    it and the neck of the gall bladder. \n\nThis is caused by the descending portion
    of the duodenum, and is known as the duodenal impression.The inferior surface
    of the left lobe of the liver presents behind and to the left of the gastric
    impression. \n\nThis is moulded over the upper front surface of the stomach,
    and to the right of this is a rounded eminence, the tuber omentale, which fits
    into the concavity of the lesser curvature of the stomach and lies in front of
    the anterior layer of the lesser omentum.\n\n\n=== Microscopic anatomy ===\n\n\nMicroscopically,
    each liver lobe is seen to be made up of hepatic lobules. \n\nThe lobules are
    roughly hexagonal, and consist of plates of hepatocytes, and sinusoids radiating
    from a central vein towards an imaginary perimeter of interlobular portal triads.
    \n\nThe central vein joins to the hepatic vein to carry blood out from the liver.
    \n\nA distinctive component of a lobule is the portal triad, which can be found
    running along each of the lobule's corners. \n\nThe portal triad, consists of
    the hepatic artery, the portal vein, and the common bile duct. \n\nThe triad
    may be seen on a liver ultrasound, as a Mickey Mouse sign with the portal vein
    as the head, and the hepatic artery, and the common bile duct as the ears.\n\nHistology,
    the study of microscopic anatomy, shows two major types of liver cell: parenchymal
    cells and nonparenchymal cells. \n\nAbout 70\u201385% of the liver volume is
    occupied by parenchymal hepatocytes. \n\nNonparenchymal cells constitute 40%
    of the total number of liver cells but only 6.5% of its volume. \n\nThe liver
    sinusoids are lined with two types of cell, sinusoidal endothelial cells, and
    phagocytic Kupffer cells. \n\nHepatic stellate cells are nonparenchymal cells
    found in the perisinusoidal space, between a sinusoid and a hepatocyte.\n\nAdditionally,
    intrahepatic lymphocytes are often present in the sinusoidal lumen.\n\n\n===
    Functional anatomy ===\n\n\nThe central area or hepatic hilum, includes the opening
    known as the porta hepatis which carries the common bile duct and common hepatic
    artery, and the opening for the portal vein. \n\nThe duct, vein, and artery divide
    into left and right branches, and the areas of the liver supplied by these branches
    constitute the functional left and right lobes. \n\nThe functional lobes are
    separated by the imaginary plane, Cantlie's line, joining the gallbladder fossa
    to the inferior vena cava. \n\nThe plane separates the liver into the true right
    and left lobes. \n\nThe middle hepatic vein also demarcates the true right and
    left lobes. \n\nThe right lobe is further divided into an anterior and posterior
    segment by the right hepatic vein. \n\nThe left lobe is divided into the medial
    and lateral segments by the left hepatic vein.\n\nThe hilum of the liver is described
    in terms of three plates that contain the bile ducts and blood vessels. \n\nThe
    contents of the whole plate system are surrounded by a sheath. \n\nThe three
    plates are the hilar plate, the cystic plate and the umbilical plate and the
    plate system is the site of the many anatomical variations to be found in the
    liver.\n\n\n=== Couinaud classification system ===\n\nIn the widely used Couinaud
    system, the functional lobes are further divided into a total of eight subsegments
    based on a transverse plane through the bifurcation of the main portal vein.
    \n\nThe caudate lobe is a separate structure that receives blood flow from both
    the right- and left-sided vascular branches. \n\nThe Couinaud classification
    divides the liver into eight functionally independent liver segments. \n\nEach
    segment has its own vascular inflow, outflow and biliary drainage. \n\nIn the
    centre of each segment are branches of the portal vein, hepatic artery, and bile
    duct. \n\nIn the periphery of each segment is vascular outflow through the hepatic
    veins. \n\nThe classification system uses the vascular supply in the liver to
    separate the functional units (numbered I to VIII) with unit 1, the caudate lobe,
    receiving its supply from both the right and the left branches of the portal
    vein. \n\nIt contains one or more hepatic veins which drain directly into the
    inferior vena cava. \n\nThe remainder of the units (II to VIII) are numbered
    in a clockwise fashion:\n\n\n=== Gene and protein expression ===\n\n\nAbout 20,000
    protein coding genes are expressed in human cells and 60% of these genes are
    expressed in a normal, adult liver. \n\nOver 400 genes are more specifically
    expressed in the liver, with some 150 genes highly specific for liver tissue.
    \n\nA large fraction of the corresponding liver specific proteins are mainly
    expressed in hepatocytes and secreted into the blood and constitute plasma proteins.
    \n\nOther liver specific proteins are certain liver enzymes such as HAO1 and
    RDH16, proteins involved in bile synthesis such as BAAT and SLC27A5, and transporter
    proteins involved in the metabolism of drugs, such as ABCB11 and SLC2A2. \n\nExamples
    of highly liver-specific proteins include apolipoprotein A II, coagulation factors
    F2 and F9, complement factor related proteins, and the fibrinogen beta chain
    protein.\n\n\n== Development ==\n\nOrganogenesis, the development of the organs,
    takes place from the third to the eighth week during embryogenesis. \n\nThe origins
    of the liver lie in both the ventral portion of the foregut endoderm (endoderm
    being one of the three embryonic germ layers) and the constituents of the adjacent
    septum transversum mesenchyme. \n\nIn the human embryo, the hepatic diverticulum
    is the tube of endoderm that extends out from the foregut into the surrounding
    mesenchyme. \n\nThe mesenchyme of septum transversum induces this endoderm to
    proliferate, to branch, and to form the glandular epithelium of the liver. \n\nA
    portion of the hepatic diverticulum (that region closest to the digestive tube)
    continues to function as the drainage duct of the liver, and a branch from this
    duct produces the gallbladder. \n\nBesides signals from the septum transversum
    mesenchyme, fibroblast growth factor from the developing heart also contributes
    to hepatic competence, along with retinoic acid emanating from the lateral plate
    mesoderm. \n\nThe hepatic endodermal cells undergo a morphological transition
    from columnar to pseudostratified resulting in thickening into the early liver
    bud. \n\nTheir expansion forms a population of the bipotential hepatoblasts.
    \n\nHepatic stellate cells are derived from mesenchyme.After migration of hepatoblasts
    into the septum transversum mesenchyme, the hepatic architecture begins to be
    established, with liver sinusoids and bile canaliculi appearing. \n\nThe liver
    bud separates into the lobes. \n\nThe left umbilical vein becomes the ductus
    venosus and the right vitelline vein becomes the portal vein. \n\nThe expanding
    liver bud is colonized by hematopoietic cells. \n\nThe bipotential hepatoblasts
    begin differentiating into biliary epithelial cells and hepatocytes. \n\nThe
    biliary epithelial cells differentiate from hepatoblasts around portal veins,
    first producing a monolayer, and then a bilayer of cuboidal cells. \n\nIn ductal
    plate, focal dilations emerge at points in the bilayer, become surrounded by
    portal mesenchyme, and undergo tubulogenesis into intrahepatic bile ducts. \n\nHepatoblasts
    not adjacent to portal veins instead differentiate into hepatocytes and arrange
    into cords lined by sinusoidal epithelial cells and bile canaliculi. \n\nOnce
    hepatoblasts are specified into hepatocytes and undergo further expansion, they
    begin acquiring the functions of a mature hepatocyte, and eventually mature hepatocytes
    appear as highly polarized epithelial cells with abundant glycogen accumulation.
    \n\nIn the adult liver, hepatocytes are not equivalent, with position along the
    portocentrovenular axis within a liver lobule dictating expression of metabolic
    genes involved in drug metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, ammonia detoxification,
    and bile production and secretion. \n\nWNT/\u03B2-catenin has now been identified
    to be playing a key role in this phenomenon.At birth, the liver comprises roughly
    4% of body weight and weighs on average about 120 g (4 oz). \n\nOver the course
    of further development, it will increase to 1.4\u20131.6 kg (3.1\u20133.5 lb)
    but will only take up 2.5\u20133.5% of body weight.\n\n\n=== Fetal blood supply
    ===\n\nIn the growing fetus, a major source of blood to the liver is the umbilical
    vein, which supplies nutrients to the growing fetus. \n\nThe umbilical vein enters
    the abdomen at the umbilicus and passes upward along the free margin of the falciform
    ligament of the liver to the inferior surface of the liver. \n\nThere, it joins
    with the left branch of the portal vein. \n\nThe ductus venosus carries blood
    from the left portal vein to the left hepatic vein and then to the inferior vena
    cava, allowing placental blood to bypass the liver. \n\nIn the fetus, the liver
    does not perform the normal digestive processes and filtration of the infant
    liver because nutrients are received directly from the mother via the placenta.
    \n\nThe fetal liver releases some blood stem cells that migrate to the fetal
    thymus, creating the T-cells or T-lymphocytes. \n\nAfter birth, the formation
    of blood stem cells shifts to the red bone marrow. \n\nAfter 2\u20135 days, the
    umbilical vein and ductus venosus are completely obliterated; the former becomes
    the round ligament of liver and the latter becomes the ligamentum venosum. \n\nIn
    the disorders of cirrhosis and portal hypertension, the umbilical vein can open
    up again.\n\n\n== Functions ==\n\nThe various functions of the liver are carried
    out by the liver cells or hepatocytes. \n\nThe liver is thought to be responsible
    for up to 500 separate functions, usually in combination with other systems and
    organs. \n\nCurrently, no artificial organ or device is capable of reproducing
    all the functions of the liver. \n\nSome functions can be carried out by liver
    dialysis, an experimental treatment for liver failure. \n\nThe liver also accounts
    for about 20% of resting total body oxygen consumption.\n\n\n=== Blood supply
    ===\n\nThe liver receives a dual blood supply from the hepatic portal vein and
    hepatic arteries. \n\nThe hepatic portal vein delivers around 75% of the liver's
    blood supply and carries venous blood drained from the spleen, gastrointestinal
    tract, and its associated organs. \n\nThe hepatic arteries supply arterial blood
    to the liver, accounting for the remaining quarter of its blood flow. \n\nOxygen
    is provided from both sources; about half of the liver's oxygen demand is met
    by the hepatic portal vein, and half is met by the hepatic arteries. \n\nThe
    hepatic artery also has both alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors; therefore,
    flow through the artery is controlled, in part, by the splanchnic nerves of the
    autonomic nervous system.\n\nBlood flows through the liver sinusoids and empties
    into the central vein of each lobule. \n\nThe central veins coalesce into hepatic
    veins, which leave the liver and drain into the inferior vena cava.\n\n\n===
    Biliary flow ===\n\nThe biliary tract is derived from the branches of the bile
    ducts. \n\nThe biliary tract, also known as the biliary tree, is the path by
    which bile is secreted by the liver then transported to the first part of the
    small intestine, the duodenum. \n\nThe bile produced in the liver is collected
    in bile canaliculi, small grooves between the faces of adjacent hepatocytes.
    \n\nThe canaliculi radiate to the edge of the liver lobule, where they merge
    to form bile ducts. \n\nWithin the liver, these ducts are termed intrahepatic
    bile ducts, and once they exit the liver, they are considered extrahepatic. \n\nThe
    intrahepatic ducts eventually drain into the right and left hepatic ducts, which
    exit the liver at the transverse fissure, and merge to form the common hepatic
    duct. \n\nThe cystic duct from the gallbladder joins with the common hepatic
    duct to form the common bile duct. \n\nThe biliary system and connective tissue
    is supplied by the hepatic artery alone.\n\nBile either drains directly into
    the duodenum via the common bile duct, or is temporarily stored in the gallbladder
    via the cystic duct. \n\nThe common bile duct and the pancreatic duct enter the
    second part of the duodenum together at the hepatopancreatic ampulla, also known
    as the ampulla of Vater.\n\n\n=== Synthesis ===\n\nThe liver plays a major role
    in carbohydrate, protein, amino acid, and lipid metabolism.\n\n\n==== Carbohydrate
    metabolism ====\n\nThe liver performs several roles in carbohydrate metabolism:
    \n\nThe liver synthesizes and stores around 100g of glycogen via glycogenesis,
    the formation of glycogen from glucose.\n\nWhen needed, the liver releases glucose
    into the blood by performing glycogenolysis, the breakdown of glycogen into glucose.\n\nThe
    liver is also responsible for gluconeogenesis, which is the synthesis of glucose
    from certain amino acids, lactate, or glycerol. \n\nAdipose and liver cells produce
    glycerol by breakdown of fat, which the liver uses for gluconeogenesis.\n\nLiver
    also does glyconeogenesis which is synthesis of glycogen from lactic acid.\n\n\n====
    Protein metabolism ====\n\nThe liver is responsible for the mainstay of protein
    metabolism, synthesis as well as degradation. \n\nAll plasma proteins except
    Gamma-globulins are synthesised in the liver. \n\nIt is also responsible for
    a large part of amino acid synthesis. \n\nThe liver plays a role in the production
    of clotting factors, as well as red blood cell production. \n\nSome of the proteins
    synthesized by the liver include coagulation factors I (fibrinogen), II (prothrombin),
    V, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, XIII, as well as protein C, protein S and antithrombin.
    \n\nThe liver is a major site of production for thrombopoietin, a glycoprotein
    hormone that regulates the production of platelets by the bone marrow.\n\n\n====
    Lipid metabolism ====\n\nThe liver plays several roles in lipid metabolism: it
    performs cholesterol synthesis, lipogenesis, and the production of triglycerides,
    and a bulk of the body's lipoproteins are synthesized in the liver. \n\nThe liver
    plays a key role in digestion, as it produces and excretes bile (a yellowish
    liquid) required for emulsifying fats and help the absorption of vitamin K from
    the diet. \n\nSome of the bile drains directly into the duodenum, and some is
    stored in the gallbladder. \n\nThe liver produces insulin-like growth factor
    1, a polypeptide protein hormone that plays an important role in childhood growth
    and continues to have anabolic effects in adults.\n\n\n=== Breakdown ===\n\nThe
    liver is responsible for the breakdown of insulin and other hormones. \n\nThe
    liver breaks down bilirubin via glucuronidation, facilitating its excretion into
    bile.\n\nThe liver is responsible for the breakdown and excretion of many waste
    products. \n\nIt plays a key role in breaking down or modifying toxic substances
    (e.g., methylation) and most medicinal products in a process called drug metabolism.
    \n\nThis sometimes results in toxication, when the metabolite is more toxic than
    its precursor. \n\nPreferably, the toxins are conjugated to avail excretion in
    bile or urine. \n\nThe liver converts ammonia into urea as part of the ornithine
    cycle or the urea cycle, and the urea is excreted in the urine.\n\n\n=== Blood
    reservoir ===\n\nBecause the liver is an expandable organ, large quantities of\nblood
    can be stored in its blood vessels. \n\nIts normal blood volume, including both
    that in the hepatic veins and that in the hepatic sinuses, is about 450 milliliters,
    or almost 10 percent of the body's total blood volume. \n\nWhen high pressure
    in the right atrium causes backpressure in the liver, the liver expands, and
    0.5 to 1 liter of extra blood is occasionally stored in the hepatic veins and
    sinuses. \n\nThis occurs especially in cardiac failure with peripheral congestion.
    \n\nThus, in effect, the liver is a large, expandable, venous organ capable of
    acting as a valuable blood reservoir in times of excess blood volume and capable
    of supplying extra blood in times of diminished blood volume.\n\n\n=== Lymph
    production ===\n\nBecause the pores in the hepatic sinusoids are very permeable
    and allow ready passage of both fluid and proteins into the perisinusoidal space,
    the lymph draining from the liver usually has a protein concentration of about
    6 g/dl, which is only slightly less than the protein concentration of plasma.
    \n\nAlso, the high permeability of the liver sinusoid epithelium allows large
    quantities of lymph to form. \n\nTherefore, about half of all the lymph formed
    in the body under resting conditions arises in the liver.\n\n\n=== Other ===\n\nThe
    liver stores a multitude of substances, including vitamin A (1\u20132 years'
    supply), vitamin D (1\u20134 months' supply), vitamin B12 (3\u20135 years' supply),
    vitamin K, vitamin E, iron, copper, zinc, cobalt, molybdenum, etc.\n\nHaemopoiesis
    - The formation of blood cells is called haemopoiesis. \n\nIn embryonic stage
    RBC and WBC are formed by liver. \n\nIn the first trimester fetus, the liver
    is the main site of red blood cell production. \n\nBy the 32nd week of gestation,
    the bone marrow has almost completely taken over that task.\n\nLiver helps in
    purification of blood. \n\nThe Kupffer cells of liver are phagocytic cells, helps
    in phagocytosis of dead blood cells and bacteria from the blood.\n\nThe liver
    is responsible for immunological effects \u2013 the mononuclear phagocyte system
    of the liver contains many immunologically active cells, acting as a 'sieve'
    for antigens carried to it via the portal system.\n\nThe liver produces albumin,
    the most abundant protein in blood serum. \n\nIt is essential in the maintenance
    of oncotic pressure, and acts as a transport for fatty acids and steroid hormones.\n\nThe
    liver synthesizes angiotensinogen, a hormone that is responsible for raising
    the blood pressure when activated by renin, an enzyme that is released when the
    kidney senses low blood pressure.\n\nThe liver produces the enzyme catalase to
    break down hydrogen peroxide, a toxic oxidising agent, into water and oxygen.\n\n\n===
    With aging ===\n\nThe oxidative capacity of the liver decreases with aging, and
    therefore any medications that require oxidation (for instance, benzodiazepines)
    are more likely to accumulate to toxic levels. \n\nHowever, medications with
    shorter half-lives, such as lorazepam and oxazepam, are preferred in most cases
    when benzodiazepines are required in regard to geriatric medicine.\n\n\n== Clinical
    significance ==\n\n=== Disease ===\n\nThe liver is a vital organ and supports
    almost every other organ in the body. \n\nBecause of its strategic location and
    multidimensional functions, the liver is also prone to many diseases. \n\nThe
    bare area of the liver is a site that is vulnerable to the passing of infection
    from the abdominal cavity to the thoracic cavity. \n\nLiver diseases may be diagnosed
    by liver function tests\u2013blood tests that can identify various markers. \n\nFor
    example, acute-phase reactants are produced by the liver in response to injury
    or inflammation.\n\nHepatitis is a common condition of inflammation of the liver.
    \n\nThe most usual cause of this is viral, and the most common of these infections
    are hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E. \n\nSome of these infections are sexually transmitted.
    \n\nInflammation can also be caused by other viruses in the family Herpesviridae
    such as the herpes simplex virus. \n\nChronic (rather than acute) infection with
    hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus is the main cause of liver cancer. \n\nGlobally,
    about 248 million individuals are chronically infected with hepatitis B (with
    843,724 in the U.S.), and 142 million are chronically infected with hepatitis
    C (with 2.7 million in the U.S.). \n\nGlobally there are about 114 million and
    20 million cases of hepatitis A and hepatitis E respectively, but these generally
    resolve and do not become chronic. \n\nHepatitis D virus is a \"satellite\" of
    hepatitis B virus (can only infect in the presence of hepatitis B), and co-infects
    nearly 20 million people with hepatitis B, globally.\n\nHepatic encephalopathy
    is caused by an accumulation of toxins in the bloodstream that are normally removed
    by the liver. \n\nThis condition can result in coma and can prove fatal. \n\nBudd\u2013Chiari
    syndrome is a condition caused by blockage of the hepatic veins (including thrombosis)
    that drain the liver. \n\nIt presents with the classical triad of abdominal pain,
    ascites and liver enlargement. \n\nMany diseases of the liver are accompanied
    by jaundice caused by increased levels of bilirubin in the system. \n\nThe bilirubin
    results from the breakup of the hemoglobin of dead red blood cells; normally,
    the liver removes bilirubin from the blood and excretes it through bile.\n\nOther
    disorders caused by excessive alcohol consumption are grouped under alcoholic
    liver diseases and these include alcoholic hepatitis, fatty liver, and cirrhosis.
    \n\nFactors contributing to the development of alcoholic liver diseases are not
    only the quantity and frequency of alcohol consumption, but can also include
    gender, genetics, and liver insult. \n\nLiver damage can also be caused by drugs,
    particularly paracetamol and drugs used to treat cancer. \n\nA rupture of the
    liver can be caused by a liver shot used in combat sports.\nPrimary biliary cholangitis
    is an autoimmune disease of the liver. \n\nIt is marked by slow progressive destruction
    of the small bile ducts of the liver, with the intralobular ducts (Canals of
    Hering) affected early in the disease. \n\nWhen these ducts are damaged, bile
    and other toxins build up in the liver (cholestasis) and over time damages the
    liver tissue in combination with ongoing immune related damage. \n\nThis can
    lead to scarring (fibrosis) and cirrhosis. \n\nCirrhosis increases the resistance
    to blood flow in the liver, and can result in portal hypertension. \n\nCongested
    anastomoses between the portal venous system and the systemic circulation, can
    be a subsequent condition.\n\nThere are also many pediatric liver diseases, including
    biliary atresia, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, alagille syndrome, progressive
    familial intrahepatic cholestasis, Langerhans cell histiocytosis and hepatic
    hemangioma a benign tumour the most common type of liver tumour, thought to be
    congenital. \n\nA genetic disorder causing multiple cysts to form in the liver
    tissue, usually in later life, and usually asymptomatic, is polycystic liver
    disease. \n\nDiseases that interfere with liver function will lead to derangement
    of these processes. \n\nHowever, the liver has a great capacity to regenerate
    and has a large reserve capacity. \n\nIn most cases, the liver only produces
    symptoms after extensive damage.\n\nHepatomegaly refers to an enlarged liver
    and can be due to many causes. \n\nIt can be palpated in a liver span measurement.\n\n\n===
    Symptoms ===\n\nThe classic symptoms of liver damage include the following:\n\nPale
    stools occur when stercobilin, a brown pigment, is absent from the stool. \n\nStercobilin
    is derived from bilirubin metabolites produced in the liver.\n\nDark urine occurs
    when bilirubin mixes with urine\n\nJaundice (yellow skin and/or whites of the
    eyes) \n\nThis is where bilirubin deposits in skin, causing an intense itch.
    \n\nItching is the most common complaint by people who have liver failure. \n\nOften
    this itch cannot be relieved by drugs.\n\nSwelling of the abdomen, and swelling
    of the ankles and feet occurs because the liver fails to make albumin.\n\nExcessive
    fatigue occurs from a generalized loss of nutrients, minerals and vitamins.\n\nBruising
    and easy bleeding are other features of liver disease. \n\nThe liver makes clotting
    factors, substances which help prevent bleeding. \n\nWhen liver damage occurs,
    these factors are no longer present and severe bleeding can occur.\n\nPain in
    the upper right quadrant can result from the stretching of Glisson's capsule
    in conditions of hepatitis and pre-eclampsia.\n\n\n=== Diagnosis ===\n\nThe diagnosis
    of liver disease is made by liver function tests, groups of blood tests, that
    can readily show the extent of liver damage. \n\nIf infection is suspected, then
    other serological tests will be carried out. \n\nA physical examination of the
    liver can only reveal its size and any tenderness, and some form of imaging such
    as an ultrasound or CT scan may also be needed.\n\nSometimes a liver biopsy will
    be necessary, and a tissue sample is taken through a needle inserted into the
    skin just below the rib cage. \n\nThis procedure may be helped by a sonographer
    providing ultrasound guidance to an interventional radiologist.\n\n\t\t\n===
    Liver regeneration ===\n\n\nThe liver is the only human internal organ capable
    of natural regeneration of lost tissue; as little as 25% of a liver can regenerate
    into a whole liver. \n\nThis is, however, not true regeneration but rather compensatory
    growth in mammals. \n\nThe lobes that are removed do not regrow and the growth
    of the liver is a restoration of function, not original form. \n\nThis contrasts
    with true regeneration where both original function and form are restored. \n\nIn
    some other species, such as zebrafish, the liver undergoes true regeneration
    by restoring both shape and size of the organ. \n\nIn the liver, large areas
    of the tissues are formed but for the formation of new cells there must be sufficient
    amount of material so the circulation of the blood becomes more active.\n\nThis
    is predominantly due to the hepatocytes re-entering the cell cycle. \n\nThat
    is, the hepatocytes go from the quiescent G0 phase to the G1 phase and undergo
    mitosis. \n\nThis process is activated by the p75 receptors. \n\nThere is also
    some evidence of bipotential stem cells, called hepatic oval cells or ovalocytes
    (not to be confused with oval red blood cells of ovalocytosis), which are thought
    to reside in the canals of Hering. \n\nThese cells can differentiate into either
    hepatocytes or cholangiocytes. \n\nCholangiocytes are the epithelial lining cells
    of the bile ducts. \n\nThey are cuboidal epithelium in the small interlobular
    bile ducts, but become columnar and mucus secreting in larger bile ducts approaching
    the porta hepatis and the extrahepatic ducts. \n\nResearch is being carried out
    on the use of stem cells for the generation of an artificial liver.\n\nScientific
    and medical works about liver regeneration often refer to the Greek Titan Prometheus
    who was chained to a rock in the Caucasus where, each day, his liver was devoured
    by an eagle, only to grow back each night. \n\nThe myth suggests the ancient
    Greeks may have known about the liver's remarkable capacity for self-repair.\n\n\n===
    Liver transplantation ===\n\nHuman liver transplants were first performed by
    Thomas Starzl in the United States and Roy Calne in Cambridge, England in 1963
    and 1967, respectively.\n\nLiver transplantation is the only option for those
    with irreversible liver failure. \n\nMost transplants are done for chronic liver
    diseases leading to cirrhosis, such as chronic hepatitis C, alcoholism, and autoimmune
    hepatitis. \n\nLess commonly, liver transplantation is done for fulminant hepatic
    failure, in which liver failure occurs over days to weeks.\n\nLiver allografts
    for transplant usually come from donors who have died from fatal brain injury.
    \n\nLiving donor liver transplantation is a technique in which a portion of a
    living person's liver is removed (hepatectomy) and used to replace the entire
    liver of the recipient. \n\nThis was first performed in 1989 for pediatric liver
    transplantation. \n\nOnly 20 percent of an adult's liver (Couinaud segments 2
    and 3) is needed to serve as a liver allograft for an infant or small child.\n\nMore
    recently, adult-to-adult liver transplantation has been done using the donor's
    right hepatic lobe, which amounts to 60 percent of the liver. \n\nDue to the
    ability of the liver to regenerate, both the donor and recipient end up with
    normal liver function if all goes well. \n\nThis procedure is more controversial,
    as it entails performing a much larger operation on the donor, and indeed there
    were at least two donor deaths out of the first several hundred cases. \n\nA
    2006 publication addressed the problem of donor mortality and found at least
    fourteen cases. \n\nThe risk of postoperative complications (and death) is far
    greater in right-sided operations than that in left-sided operations.\n\nWith
    the recent advances of noninvasive imaging, living liver donors usually have
    to undergo imaging examinations for liver anatomy to decide if the anatomy is
    feasible for donation. \n\nThe evaluation is usually performed by multidetector
    row computed tomography (MDCT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). \n\nMDCT
    is good in vascular anatomy and volumetry. \n\nMRI is used for biliary tree anatomy.
    \n\nDonors with very unusual vascular anatomy, which makes them unsuitable for
    donation, could be screened out to avoid unnecessary operations.\n\n\n== Society
    and culture ==\n\nSome cultures regard the liver as the seat of the soul. \n\nIn
    Greek mythology, the gods punished Prometheus for revealing fire to humans by
    chaining him to a rock where a vulture (or an eagle) would peck out his liver,
    which would regenerate overnight. \n\n(The liver is the only human internal organ
    that actually can regenerate itself to a significant extent.) \n\nMany ancient
    peoples of the Near East and Mediterranean areas practiced a type of divination
    called haruspicy or hepatomancy, where they tried to obtain information by examining
    the livers of sheep and other animals.\n\nIn Plato, and in later physiology,
    the liver was thought to be the seat of the darkest emotions (specifically wrath,
    jealousy and greed) which drive men to action. \n\nThe Talmud (tractate Berakhot
    61b) refers to the liver as the seat of anger, with the gallbladder counteracting
    this. \n\nThe Persian, Urdu, and Hindi languages (\u062C\u06AF\u0631 or jigar)
    refer to the liver figurative speech to indicate courage and strong feelings,
    or \"their best\"; e.g., \"This Mecca has thrown to you the pieces of its liver!\".
    \n\nThe term jan e jigar, literally \"the strength (power) of my liver\", is
    a term of endearment in Urdu. \n\nIn Persian slang, jigar is used as an adjective
    for any object which is desirable, especially women. \n\nIn the Zulu language,
    the word for liver (isibindi) is the same as the word for courage. \n\nIn English
    the term 'lily-livered' is used to indicate cowardice from the medieval belief
    that the liver was the seat of courage.\nSpanish h\xEDgados also means \"courage\".\n\nHowever
    the secondary meaning of Basque gibel is \"indolence\".In biblical Hebrew, the
    word for liver, \u05DB\u05D1\u05D3 (Kauved, stemmed KBD or KVD, similar to Arabic
    \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0628\u062F), also means heavy and is used to describe the
    rich (\"heavy\" with possessions) and honor (presumably for the same reason).
    \n\nIn the Book of Lamentations (2:11) it is used to describe the physiological
    responses to sadness by \"my liver spilled to earth\" along with the flow of
    tears and the overturning in bitterness of the intestines. \n\nOn several occasions
    in the book of Psalms (most notably 16:9), the word is used to describe happiness
    in the liver, along with the heart (which beats rapidly) and the flesh (which
    appears red under the skin). \n\nFurther usage as the self (similar to \"your
    honor\") is widely available throughout the old testament, sometimes compared
    to the breathing soul (Genesis 49:6, Psalms 7:6, etc.). \n\nAn honorable hat
    was also referred to with this word (Job 19:9, etc.) and under that definition
    appears many times along with \u05E4\u05D0\u05E8 Pe'er - grandeur.\n\nThese four
    meanings were used in preceding ancient Semitic languages such as Accadian and
    Ancient Egyptian preserved in classical Ethiopic Ge'ez language.\n\n\n=== Food
    ===\n\n\nHumans commonly eat the livers of mammals, fowl, and fish as food. \n\nDomestic
    pig, ox, lamb, calf, chicken, and goose livers are widely available from butchers
    and supermarkets. \n\nIn the Romance languages, the anatomical word for \"liver\"
    (French foie, Spanish h\xEDgado, etc.) derives not from the Latin anatomical
    term, jecur, but from the culinary term ficatum, literally \"stuffed with figs,\"
    referring to the livers of geese that had been fattened on figs. \n\nAnimal livers
    are rich in iron, vitamin A and vitamin B12; and cod liver oil is commonly used
    as a dietary supplement.\n\nLiver can be baked, boiled, broiled, fried, stir-fried,
    or eaten raw (asbeh nayeh or sawda naye in Lebanese cuisine, or liver sashimi
    in Japanese cuisine). \n\nIn many preparations, pieces of liver are combined
    with pieces of meat or kidneys, as in the various forms of Middle Eastern mixed
    grill (e.g. meurav Yerushalmi). \n\nWell-known examples include liver p\xE2t\xE9,
    foie gras, chopped liver, and leverpastej. \n\nLiver sausages, such as Braunschweiger
    and liverwurst, are also a valued meal. \n\nLiver sausages may also be used as
    spreads. \n\nA traditional South African delicacy, skilpadjies, is made of minced
    lamb's liver wrapped in netvet (caul fat), and grilled over an open fire. \n\nTraditionally,
    some fish livers were valued as food, especially the stingray liver. \n\nIt was
    used to prepare delicacies, such as poached skate liver on toast in England,
    as well as the beignets de foie de raie and foie de raie en croute in French
    cuisine.\n\n\n=== Giraffe liver ===\n\nThe Humr, one of the tribes in the Baggara
    ethnic grouping, native to southwestern Kordofan in Sudan and speakers of Shuwa
    or Chadian Arabic, prepare a non-alcoholic drink from the liver and bone marrow
    of the giraffe which they call umm nyolokh, and which they claim is intoxicating
    ( Arabic \u0633\u0643\u0631\u0627\u0646 sakran ), causing dreams and even waking
    hallucinations. \n\nAnthropologist Ian Cunnison, who accompanied the Humr on
    one of their giraffe-hunting expeditions in the late 1950s, notes that:\n\nIt
    is said that a person, once he has drunk umm nyolokh, will return to giraffe
    again and again. \n\nHumr, being Mahdists, are strict abstainers [ from alcohol
    ] and a Humrawi is never drunk ( sakran ) on liquor or beer. \n\nBut he uses
    this word to describe the effects which umm nyolokh has upon him.\n\nCunnison's
    remarkable account of an apparently psychoactive mammal found its way from a
    somewhat obscure scientific paper into more mainstream literature through a conversation
    between Dr. \n\nWendy James of the Institute of Social and Cultural Anthropology
    at the University of Oxford and specialist on the use of hallucinogens and intoxicants
    in society Richard Rudgley, who considered its implications in his popular work
    The Encyclopedia of Psychoactive Substances. \n\nRudgley hypothesises that the
    presence of the hallucinogenic compound DMT might account for the putative intoxicating
    properties of umm nyolokh.Cunnison himself, on the other hand, had found it hard
    fully to believe in the literal truth of the Humr's assertion that their drink
    was intoxicating:\n\nI can only assume that there is no intoxicating substance
    in the drink and that the effect it produces is simply a matter of convention,
    although it may be brought about subconsciously.\n\nThe study of entheogens in
    general - including entheogens of animal origin ( e.g. hallucinogenic fish and
    toad venom ) - has, however, made considerable progress in the sixty-odd years
    since Cunnison's report and the idea that some intoxicating principle might reside
    in giraffe liver no longer seems as far-fetched as it was in Cunnison's day,
    although conclusive proof ( or disproof ) will have to await detailed analyses
    of the animal organ in question and the drink prepared therefrom.\n\n\n=== Arrow/bullet
    poison ===\n\nCertain Tungusic peoples formerly prepared a type of arrow poison
    from rotting animal livers, which was, in later times, also applied to bullets.
    \n\nRussian anthropologist Sergei Mikhailovich Shirokogorov notes that: Formerly
    the using of poisoned arrows was common. \n\nFor instance, among the Kumar\u010Den,
    [ a subgroup of the Oroqen ] even in recent times a poison was used which was
    prepared from decaying liver.  \n\nThis has been confirmed by the Kumar\u010Den.
    \n\nI am not competent to judge as to the chemical conditions of production of
    poison which is not destroyed by the heat of explosion. \n\nHowever, the Tungus
    themselves compare this method [ of poisoning ammunition ] with the poisoning
    of arrows.\n\n\n== Other animals ==\n\nThe liver is found in all vertebrates
    and is typically the largest internal organ. \n\nIts form varies considerably
    in different species, and is largely determined by the shape and arrangement
    of the surrounding organs. \n\nNonetheless, in most species it is divided into
    right and left lobes; exceptions to this general rule include snakes, where the
    shape of the body necessitates a simple cigar-like form. \n\nThe internal structure
    of the liver is broadly similar in all vertebrates.\n\nAn organ sometimes referred
    to as a liver is found associated with the digestive tract of the primitive chordate
    Amphioxus. \n\nAlthough it performs many functions of a liver, it is not considered
    a true liver but a homolog of the vertebrate liver. \n\nThe amphioxus hepatic
    caecum produces the liver-specific proteins vitellogenin, antithrombin, plasminogen,
    alanine aminotransferase, and insulin/Insulin-like growth factor (IGF)\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver"

  descriptionText: "\n\nPAROTID GLAND\n\n\nThe parotid gland is a major salivary
    gland in many animals. \n\nIn humans, the two parotid glands are present on either
    side of the mouth and in front of both ears. \n\nThey are the largest of the
    salivary glands. \n\nEach parotid is wrapped around the mandibular ramus, and
    secretes serous saliva through the parotid duct into the mouth, to facilitate
    mastication and swallowing and to begin the digestion of starches. \n\nThere
    are also two other types of salivary glands; they are submandibular and sublingual
    glands. \n\nSometimes accessory parotid glands are found close to the main parotid
    glands.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe word parotid literally means \"beside the
    ear\". \n\nFrom Greek \u03C0\u03B1\u03C1\u03C9\u03C4\u03AF\u03C2 (stem \u03C0\u03B1\u03C1\u03C9\u03C4\u03B9\u03B4-)
    : (gland) behind the ear < \u03C0\u03B1\u03C1\u03AC - par\xE1 : in front, and
    \u03BF\u1F56\u03C2 - ous (stem \u1F60\u03C4-, \u014Dt-) : ear.\n\n\n== Structure
    ==\n\nThe parotid glands are a pair of mainly serous salivary glands located
    below and in front of each ear canal, draining their secretions into the vestibule
    of the mouth through the parotid duct. \n\nEach gland lies behind the mandibular
    ramus and in front of the mastoid process of the temporal bone. \n\nThe gland
    can be felt on either side, by feeling in front of each ear, along the cheek,
    and below the angle of the mandible.\n\nThe parotid duct, a long excretory duct,
    emerges from the front of each gland, superficial to the masseter muscle. \n\nThe
    duct pierces the buccinator muscle, then opens into the mouth on the inner surface
    of the cheek, usually opposite the maxillary second molar. \n\nThe parotid papilla
    is a small elevation of tissue that marks the opening of the parotid duct on
    the inner surface of the cheek.The gland has four surfaces \u2013 superficial
    or lateral, superior, anteromedial, and posteromedial. \n\nThe gland has three
    borders \u2013 anterior, medial, and posterior. \n\nThe parotid gland has two
    ends \u2013 superior end in the form of small superior surface and an inferior
    end (apex). \n\nA number of different structures pass through the gland. \n\nFrom
    lateral to medial, these are:\n\nFacial nerve\nRetromandibular vein\nExternal
    carotid artery\nSuperficial temporal artery\nBranches of the great auricular
    nerve\nMaxillary arterySometimes accessory parotid glands are found as an anatomic
    variation. \n\nThese are close to the main glands and consist of ectopic salivary
    gland tissue.\n\nCapsule of parotid gland\n\nCapsule of the parotid gland is
    formed from the investing layer of the deep cervical fascia. \n\nIt is supplied
    by great auricular nerve. \n\nThe fascia splits to enclose the gland. \n\nThis
    splitting occurs between the angle of the mandible and the mastoid process. \n\nThe
    superficial lamina (parotidomassetric fascia) is thick and is attached to zygomatic
    arch. \n\nThe deep lamina is thin and is attached to styloid process, tympanic
    plate and the ramus of the mandible. \n\nThe part of deep lamina extending between
    the styloid process and the mandible is thickened to form stylomastoid ligament.
    \n\nThe stylomandibular ligament separates parotid gland from the superficial
    lobe of the submandibular gland.\n\n\n=== Location ===\n\nSuperficial or lateral
    relations: \n    The gland is situated deep to the skin, superficial fascia,
    superficial lamina of investing layer of deep cervical fascia and great auricular
    nerve (anterior ramus of C2 and C3).\n\nAnteromedial relations: \n    The gland
    is situated posterolaterally to the mandibular ramus, masseter and medial pterygoid
    muscles. \n\nA part of the gland may extend between the ramus and medial pterygoid,
    as the pterygoid process. \n\nBranches of facial nerve and parotid duct emerge
    through this surface.\n\nPosteromedial relations: \n    The gland is situated
    anterolaterally to mastoid process of temporal bone with its attached sternocleidomastoid
    and digastric muscles, styloid process of temporal bone with its three attached
    muscles (stylohyoid, stylopharyngeus, and styloglossus) and carotid sheath with
    its contained neurovasculature (internal carotid artery, internal jugular vein,
    and 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th cranial nerves).\n\nMedial relations: \n    The
    parotid gland comes into contact with the superior pharyngeal constrictor muscle
    at the medial border, where the anteromedial and posteromedial surfaces meet.
    \n\nHence, a need exists to examine the fauces in parotitis.\n\n\n=== Blood supply
    ===\n\nThe external carotid artery and its terminal branches within the gland,
    namely, the superficial temporal and the maxillary artery, also the posterior
    auricular artery supply the parotid gland. \n\nVenous return is to the retromandibular
    veins.\n\n\n=== Lymphatic drainage ===\n\nThe gland is mainly drained into the
    preauricular or parotid lymph nodes which ultimately drain to the deep cervical
    chain.\n\n\n=== Nerve supply ===\n\nThe parotid gland receives both sensory and
    autonomic innervation. \n\nGeneral sensory innervation to the parotid gland,
    its sheath, and the overlying skin is provided by the auriculotemporal nerve.
    \n\nThe autonomic innervation controls the rate of saliva production and is supplied
    by the glossopharyngeal nerve.\n\nThe cell bodies of the preganglionic sympathetic
    fibres usually lie in the lateral horns of upper thoracic spinal segments (T1-T3).
    \n\nPostganglionic sympathetic fibers from superior cervical sympathetic ganglion
    reach the gland as periarterial nerve plexuses around the external carotid artery
    and their function is mainly vasoconstriction. \n\nPreganglionic parasympathetic
    fibers leave the brain stem from inferior salivatory nucleus in the glossopharyngeal
    nerve and then through its tympanic and then the lesser petrosal branch pass
    into the otic ganglion. \n\nThere, they synapse with postganglionic fibers which
    reach the gland by hitch-hiking via the auriculotemporal nerve, a branch of the
    mandibular nerve.:\u200A255\u200A\n\n\n=== Histology ===\n\n\nThe gland has a
    capsule of its own of dense connective tissue, but is also provided with a false
    capsule by the investing layer of the deep cervical fascia. \n\nThe fascia at
    the imaginary line between the angle of the mandible and the mastoid process
    splits into a superficial and a deep lamina to enclose the gland. \n\nThe risorius
    is a small muscle embedded with this capsule substance.\nThe gland has short,
    striated ducts and long, intercalated ducts. \n\nThe intercalated ducts are also
    numerous and lined with cuboidal epithelial cells, and have lumina larger than
    those of the acini. \n\nThe striated ducts are also numerous and consist of simple
    columnar epithelium, having striations that represent the infolded basal cell
    membranes and mitochondria.\n\nThough the parotid gland is the largest, it provides
    only 25% of the total salivary volume. \n\nThe serous cell predominates in the
    parotid, making the gland secrete a mainly serous secretory product.\n\nThe parotid
    gland also secretes salivary alpha-amylase (sAA), which is the first step in
    the decomposition of starches during mastication. \n\nIt is the main exocrine
    gland to secrete this. \n\nIt breaks down amylose (straight chain starch) and
    amylopectin (branched starch) by hydrolyzing alpha 1,4 bonds. \n\nAdditionally,
    the alpha amylase has been suggested to prevent bacterial attachment to oral
    surfaces and to enable bacterial clearance from the mouth.\n\n\n== Development
    ==\n\nThe parotid salivary glands appear early in the sixth week of the prenatal
    development and are the first major salivary glands formed. \n\nThe epithelial
    buds of these glands are located on the inner part of the cheek, near the labial
    commissures of the primitive mouth (from ectodermal lining near angles of the
    stomodeum in the 1st/2nd pharyngeal arches; the stomodeum itself is created from
    the rupturing of the oropharyngeal membrane at about 26 days.) \n\nThese buds
    grow posteriorly toward the otic placodes of the ears and branch to form solid
    cords with rounded terminal ends near the developing facial nerve. \n\nLater,
    at around 10 weeks of prenatal development, these cords are canalized and form
    ducts, with the largest becoming the parotid duct for the parotid gland. \n\nThe
    rounded terminal ends of the cords form the acini of the glands. \n\nSecretion
    by the parotid glands via the parotid duct begins at about 18 weeks of gestation.
    \n\nAgain, the supporting connective tissue of the gland develops from the surrounding
    mesenchyme.\n\n\n== Parotid gland swellings ==\n\n=== Causes ===\n\n==== Mumps
    ====\n\nMumps is seen to be a common cause of parotid gland swelling \u2013 85%
    of cases occur in children younger than 15 years. \n\nThe disease is highly contagious
    and spreads by airborne droplets from salivary, nasal, and urinary secretions.
    \n\nSymptoms include oedema in the area, trismus as well as otalgia. \n\nThe
    lesion tends to begin on one side of the face and eventually becomes bilateral.
    \n\nThe transmission of the paramyxovirus is by contact with the infected persons
    saliva. \n\nInitial symptoms tend to be a headache and fever. \n\nMumps is not
    fatal, however further complications can include swelling of the ovaries or the
    testes. \n\nDiagnosis of mumps is confirmed through viral serology, management
    of the condition includes hydration and good oral hygiene of the patient requiring
    excellent motivation. \n\nHowever, since the development of the mumps vaccine,
    given at the age of between 4\u20136 years, the incidence of this viral infection
    has greatly reduced. \n\nThis vaccine has reduced the incidence by 99%.\n\n\n====
    Neoplasms ====\n\n===== Benign =====\n\nNeoplastic lesions of the parotid salivary
    gland can either be benign or malignant. \n\nWithin the parotid gland, nearly
    80% of tumours are benign. \n\nBenign lesions tend to be painless, asymptomatic
    and slow-growing. \n\nThe most common salivary gland neoplasms in children are
    hemangiomas, lymphatic malformations, and pleomorphic adenomas. \n\nDiagnosis
    of benign lesions require a fine-needle-like aspiration biopsy. \n\nWith various
    benign lesions, most commonly the pleomorphic adenoma, there is a risk of developing
    malignancy over time. \n\nAs a result, these lesions are typically resected.\n\nPleomorphic
    adenoma is seen to be a common benign neoplasm of the salivary gland and has
    an overall incidence of 54\u201368%. \n\nThe Warthin tumour has a lower incidence
    of 6\u201310%; this tumour is associated with smoking and is more common in older
    men. \n\nBenign lesions of the parotid gland have a significantly higher incidence
    than malignant lesions.\n\n\n===== Malignant =====\n\nMalignant salivary gland
    lesions are rare. \n\nHowever, when a tumour extends to the submandibular, sublingual
    and the minor salivary glands, they tend to be malignant. \n\nDistinguishing
    a malignant lesion from a benign one may be difficult as they both present as
    painless lesions. \n\nA biopsy is crucial in aiding diagnosis. \n\nThere are
    common signs that can highlight the presence of a malignant lesion. \n\nThese
    include facial nerve weakness, rapid increase of the size of the lump as well
    as ulceration of the mucosa of the skin.\n\nMucoepidermoid carcinoma is a common
    malignant tumour of the salivary glands and has a low incidence of 4\u201313%.
    \n\nAdenoid cystic carcinoma is also a common malignant salivary gland lesion
    and has an incidence of 4\u20138%. \n\nThis carcinoma tends to invade nerves
    and can re-occur post-treatment.\n\n\n==== Polycystic Parotid Disease ====\n\nA
    developmental polycystic disease of the salivary gland is seen to be extremely
    rare and is seen to be independent of recurrent parotitis. \n\nThe cause is thought
    to be a defect in the interactions between activin, follistatin and TGF-\u03B2,
    leading to a developmental disorder of glandular tissue.\n\n\n== Clinical significance
    ==\n\n=== Parotitis ===\n\nInflammation of one or both parotid glands is known
    as parotitis. \n\nThe most common cause of parotitis is mumps. \n\nWidespread
    vaccination against mumps has markedly reduced the incidence of mumps parotitis.
    \n\nThe pain of mumps is due to the swelling of the gland within its fibrous
    capsule.\n\nApart from viral infection, other infections, such as bacterial,
    can cause parotitis (acute suppurative parotitis or chronic parotitis). \n\nThese
    infections may cause blockage of the duct by salivary duct calculi or external
    compression. \n\nParotid gland swellings can also be due to benign lymphoepithelial
    lesions caused by Mikulicz disease and Sj\xF6gren syndrome. \n\nSwelling of the
    parotid gland may also indicate the eating disorder bulimia nervosa, creating
    the look of a heavy jaw line. \n\nWith the inflammation of mumps or obstruction
    of the ducts, increased levels of the salivary alpha amylase secreted by the
    parotid gland can be detected in the blood stream.\n\n\n=== Fibrous reactions
    ===\n\nTuberculosis and syphilis can cause granuloma formation in the parotid
    glands.\n\n\n=== Salivary stones ===\n\nSalivary stones mainly occur within the
    main confluence of the ducts and within the main parotid duct. \n\nThe patient
    usually complains of intense pain when salivating and tends to avoid foods which
    produce this symptom. \n\nIn addition, the parotid gland may become enlarged
    upon trying to eat. \n\nThe pain can be reproduced in clinic by squirting lemon
    juice into the mouth. \n\nSurgery depends upon the site of the stone: if within
    the anterior aspect of the duct, a simple incision into the buccal mucosa with
    sphinterotomy may allow removal; however, if situated more posteriorly within
    the main duct, complete gland excision may be necessary.\n\n\n=== Injury ===\n\nThe
    parotid salivary gland can also be pierced and the facial nerve temporarily traumatized
    when an inferior alveolar local anesthesia nerve block is incorrectly administered,
    causing transient facial paralysis.\n\n\n=== Cancer and tumours ===\n\nAbout
    80% of tumors of the parotid gland are benign. \n\nThe most common of these include
    pleomorphic adenoma (70% of tumors, of which 60% occur in females) and Warthin
    tumor (i.e. adenolymphoma, which is more common in males than in females). \n\nTheir
    importance is in relation to their anatomical position and tendency to grow over
    time. \n\nThe tumorous growth can also change the consistency of the gland and
    cause facial pain on the involved side.\n\nAround 20% of parotid tumors are malignant,
    with the most common tumors being mucoepidermoid carcinoma and adenoid cystic
    carcinoma. \n\nOther malignant tumors of the parotid gland include acinic cell
    carcinoma, carcinoma expleomorphic adenoma, adenocarcinoma (arising from ductal
    epithelium of parotid gland), squamous cell carcinoma (arising from parenchyma
    of parotid gland), and undifferentiated carcinoma. \n\nMetastasis from other
    sites like phyllodes tumour of breast presenting as parotid swelling have also
    been described. \n\nCritically, the relationship of the tumor to the branches
    of the facial nerve (CN VII) must be defined because resection may damage the
    nerves, resulting in paralysis of the muscles of facial expression.\n\n\n===
    Surgery ===\n\nSurgical treatment of parotid gland tumors is sometimes difficult
    because of the anatomical relations of the facial nerve parotid lodge, as well
    as the increased potential for postoperative relapse. \n\nThus, detection of
    early stages of a parotid tumor is extremely important in terms of postoperative
    prognosis. \n\nOperative technique is laborious, because of relapses and incomplete
    previous treatment made in other border specialties. \n\nSurgical techniques
    in parotid surgery have evolved in the last years with the use of neuromonitoring
    of the facial nerve and have become safer and less invasive.\n\nAfter surgical
    removal of the parotid gland (Parotidectomy), the auriculotemporal nerve is liable
    to damage and upon recovery it fuses with sweat glands. \n\nThis can cause sweating
    on the cheek on the side of the face of the affected gland. \n\nThis condition
    is known as Frey's syndrome.\n\n\n== Infections ==\n\n=== Bacterial infections
    ===\n\n==== Acute bacterial parotitis ====\n\nCommonly caused by a retrograde
    bacterial infection as a result of illness, sepsis, trauma, surgery, reduced
    salivary flow due to medications, diabetes, malnutrition and dehydration. \n\nClassically
    symptoms of painful swelling in the parotid region when eating seen. \n\nManagement
    is based upon antibacterials, rehydration combined with gentle massage to encourage
    salivary flow.\n\n\n==== Chronic bacterial parotitis ====\n\nA latent infection
    despite clinical resolution of the disease resulting in impaired function. \n\nHistologically
    glandular duct dilation, abscess formation and atrophy may be seen. \n\nParotid
    secretions are viscous. \n\nDisease course shows pain and swelling, waxing and
    waning. \n\nRadiographic screening should be undertaken to rule out sialolith.
    \n\nManagement with palliative care with parotidectomy as a last resort.\n\n\n\n===
    Viral infections ===\n\n==== Mumps ====\n\nAcute non-suppurative disease that
    often occurs in epidemics. \n\nPrevented by MMR vaccine. \n\nCaused by paramyxovirus
    that is transmitted by infected saliva and urine. \n\nA prodromal period of 24\u201328
    hours is experienced, followed by rapid and painful swelling of the parotid gland.
    \n\nTreatment is supportive (bedrest, hydration) as spontaneous resolution occurs
    within 5\u201310 days.\n\n\n==== HIV / AIDS ====\n\nDiffuse gland enlargement
    is seen, and may affect patients throughout all stages of the infection. \n\nLymphoepithelial
    cysts seen via imaging help aid diagnosis. \n\nPathogenic process occurs due
    to circulating CD8 lymphocytes within the salivary gland. \n\nMedical management
    via use of antiretrovirals, excellent oral hygiene measures and sialogogues.\n\n\n===
    Autoimmune related ===\n\n==== Systemic lupus erythematosus ====\n\nMost commonly
    seen in fourth and fifth decades in women, and can affect any salivary gland.
    \n\nPresentation is a slowly enlarging gland, with diagnosis made by identification
    of the underlying systemic disorder and measurements of salivary chemical levels.
    \n\nSodium and chloride ion levels will be elevated two or three times normal
    levels. \n\nTreatment is by addressing the underlying systemic condition.\n\n\n====
    Sarcoidosis ====\n\nSarcoidosis is a chronic systemic disease characterised by
    the production of non-caseating granulomas of unknown aetiology. \n\nIt can affect
    any organ of the body, depressing cellular immunity and enhancing humoral immunity.\n\nSalivary
    gland involvement primarily involves the parotid gland, causing enlargement and
    swelling. \n\nSalivary gland biopsy with histopathologic examination is needed
    to make the distinction between whether Sjoren\u2019s syndrome or sarcoidosis
    is the cause of this.\n\n\n==== Sjogren's syndrome ====\n\nSalivary gland enlargement
    occurs in up to 30% of patients with Sjogren\u2019s syndrome, with the parotid
    gland being most often enlarged, and bilateral parotid gland enlargement seen
    in 25\u201360% of patients. \n\nHowever, the parotid glands have a longer-lasting
    secretory capacity in Sjogren\u2019s syndrome patient and therefore are the last
    glands to manifest hyposalivation in the disease. \n\nHistopathology shows clustering
    of lymphocytic infiltrates and epimyoepithelial islands.\n\n\n=== Mycobacterial
    infection ===\n\n\nThe most common head and neck manifestation of tuberculosis
    mycobacterial disease is infection of cervical lymph nodes. \n\nThe infection
    is thought to originate in the tonsils or gingiva, ascending to the parotid gland.
    \n\nTwo clinical forms; acute and chronic lesions. \n\nAcute lesions have diffuse
    glandular edema, easily confused with acute sialdentitis or abscess. \n\nThe
    chronic lesions occur as slow growing masses mimicking tumors.\n\n\n== Examination
    of the salivary gland ==\n\n\n\n=== History and examination ===\n\nA patient
    with parotid swelling may complain of swelling, pain, xerostomia, bad taste and
    sometimes sialorrhoea.\n\nThe most common presenting symptom of neoplasms (both
    benign and malignant) is an asymptomatic swelling. \n\nPain is more common in
    patients with parotid cancer (10\u201329% feel pain) than those with benign neoplasms
    (only 2.5\u20134%), but pain itself it not diagnostic of malignancy.\n\nEpisodic
    swelling of major salivary glands accompanied by pain and related to salivary
    stimuli suggests duct obstruction.\n\nAlso need to assess the facial nerve. \n\nThe
    facial nerve passes through the parotid so may be affected if there is a change
    in the parotid gland. \n\nFacial nerve paralysis in a previously untreated patient
    usually indicates that a tumour is malignant.\n\n\n=== Physical examination ===\n\nThe
    superficial location of the salivary glands allows palpation and visual inspection.
    \n\nThe inspection must be systematic, both intraorally and extraorally, so no
    area is missed.\n\nFor extraoral examination the patients head should be inclined
    forwards in order to maximally expose the parotid and submandibular glands. \n\nA
    normal parotid gland is barely palpable and a normal sublingual gland is not
    palpable.Intra-oral examination should include observations for asymmetry, discolouration,
    pulsation and obstructions in the duct orifices. \n\nSwelling of the deep lobe
    of the parotid gland may be seen intra-orally, and may also displace the tonsil.
    \n\nThe minor salivary glands should be examined. \n\nThe labial, buccal and
    posterior palatal mucosa should be dried with an air blower or tissue and pressed
    to assess the flow of saliva.\n\n\n=== Salivary testing ===\n\nSalivary stimulation\n\nThis
    can be done by palpating the parotid gland, thus stimulating it. \n\nAssess to
    see whether there is saliva flowing from the parotid papilla.Sialography\n\nSialograms
    can identify changes in salivary gland architecture and are useful in the evaluation
    of major gland swellings.\n\nIt involves the instillation of a radio-opaque fluid
    into the major gland ductal system. \n\nThis outlines the major and minor ductal
    systems, and also gives an outline of the glandular tissue.\n\nFor example, sialadenitis
    creates an appearance known as \u201Cpruning of the tree\u201D on a sialogram,
    where there are less branches visible from the duct system. \n\nAlso, a space
    occupying lesion that occurs within or adjacent to a salivary gland can displace
    the normal anatomy of the gland. \n\nThis may create an appearance known as \u201Cball
    in hand\u201D on a sialogram, where the ducts are curved around the mass of the
    lesion.Sialochemistry\n\nThe composition of saliva changes in disease states,
    and analysis of saliva for enzymes, electrolytes, hormones, drugs and immunisation
    status can be performed.Radioisotope scintigraphy \n\nGives an objective measure
    of isotope uptake and excretion using a gamma scintillation camera. \n\nAfter
    about 20 minutes, a salivary stimulant will be given to promote salivary flow
    through the gland. \n\nThey are used to assess patients with persistent symptoms
    of dry mouth and also to evaluate salivary gland swelling due to infection, inflammation
    or obstruction.\n\n\n=== Further tests ===\n\n-Imagining techniques\n\n-Ultrasounds,
    CT Scans or MRIs can aid with disease localisation\n\n-Sialoendoscopy\n\n-A camera
    is inserted into the duct of a salivary gland to assess blockages\n\n-Biopsy\n\n-This
    can be done by fine needle aspiration biopsy, which provides an opportunity to
    obtain information about the histology of a salivary tumour prior to initiation
    of treatment.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parotid_gland"

  descriptionText: "\n\nTRACHEA\n\n\nThe trachea, also known as the windpipe, is
    a cartilaginous tube that connects the larynx to the bronchi of the lungs, allowing
    the passage of air, and so is present in almost all air-breathing animals with
    lungs. \n\nThe trachea extends from the larynx and branches into the two primary
    bronchi. \n\nAt the top of the trachea the cricoid cartilage attaches it to the
    larynx. \n\nThe trachea is formed by a number of horseshoe-shaped rings, joined
    together vertically by overlying ligaments, and by the trachealis muscle at their
    ends. \n\nThe epiglottis closes the opening to the larynx during swallowing.\nThe
    trachea begins to form in the second month of embryo development, becoming longer
    and more fixed in its position over time. \n\nIt is epithelium lined with column-shaped
    cells that have hair-like extensions called cilia, with scattered goblet cells
    that produce protective mucins. \n\nThe trachea can be affected by inflammation
    or infection, usually as a result of a viral illness affecting other parts of
    the respiratory tract, such as the larynx and bronchi, called croup, that can
    result in a barking cough. \n\nInfection with bacteria usually affects the trachea
    only and can cause narrowing or even obstruction. \n\nAs a major part of the
    respiratory tract, when obstructed the trachea prevents air entering the lungs
    and so a tracheostomy may be required if the trachea is obstructed. \n\nAdditionally,
    during surgery if mechanical ventilation is required when a person is sedated,
    a tube is inserted into the trachea, called intubation.\n\nThe word trachea is
    used to define a very different organ in invertebrates than in vertebrates. \n\nInsects
    have an open respiratory system made up of spiracles, tracheae, and tracheoles
    to transport metabolic gases to and from tissues.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\n\nAn
    adult's trachea has an inner diameter of about 1.5 to 2 centimetres (0.59 to
    0.79 in) and a length of about 10 to 11 centimetres (3.9 to 4.3 in); wider in
    males than females. \n\nIt begins at the bottom of the larynx and ends at the
    carina, the point where the trachea branches into the left and right main bronchi.
    \n\nThe trachea is surrounded by 16\u201320 rings of hyaline cartilage; these
    'rings' are 4 millimetres high in the adult, incomplete and C-shaped. \n\nLigaments
    connect the rings. \n\nThe trachealis muscle connects the ends of the incomplete
    rings and runs along the back wall of the trachea. \n\nAlso adventitia, which
    is the outermost layer of connective tissue that surrounds the hyaline cartilage,
    contributes to the trachea's ability to bend and stretch with movement.\n\nThe
    trachea begins at the lower edge of the cricoid cartilage of the larynx and ends
    at the carina, the point where the trachea branches into left and right main
    bronchi. \n\nThe trachea begins level with the sixth cervical vertebra (C6),
    and the carina is found at the level of the fourth thoracic vertebra (T4), although
    its position may change with breathing.\n\n\n=== Nearby structures ===\n\nThe
    trachea passes by many structures of the neck and chest (thorax) along its course.\nIn
    front of the upper trachea lies connective tissue and skin. \n\nSeveral other
    structures pass over or sit on the trachea; the jugular arch, which joins the
    two anterior jugular veins, sits in front of the upper part of the trachea. \n\nThe
    sternohyoid and sternothyroid muscles stretch along its length. \n\nThe thyroid
    gland also stretches across the upper trachea, with the isthmus overlying the
    second to fourth rings, and the lobes stretching to the level of the fifth or
    sixth cartilage. \n\nThe blood vessels of the thyroid rest on the trachea next
    to the isthmus; superior thyroid arteries join just above it, and the inferior
    thyroid veins below it. \n\nIn front of the lower trachea lies the manubrium
    of the sternum, the remnants of the thymus in adults. \n\nTo the front left lie
    the large blood vessels the aortic arch and its branches the left common carotid
    artery and the brachiocephalic trunk; and the left brachiocephalic vein. \n\nThe
    deep cardiac plexus and lymph nodes are also positioned in front of the lower
    trachea.Behind the trachea, along its length, sits the oesophagus, followed by
    connective tissue and the vertebral column. \n\nTo its sides run the carotid
    arteries and inferior thyroid arteries; and to its sides on its back surface
    run the recurrent laryngeal nerves in the upper trachea, and the vagus nerves
    in the lower trachea.\n\nThe trachealis muscle contracts during coughing, reducing
    the size of the lumen of the trachea.\n\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Blood and lymphatic supply
    ===\n\n\nThe upper part of trachea receives and drains blood through the inferior
    thyroid arteries and veins; the lower trachea receives blood from bronchial arteries.
    \n\nArteries that supply the trachea do so via small branches that supply the
    trachea from the sides. \n\nAs the branches approach the wall of the trachea,
    they split into inferior and superior branches, which join with the branches
    of the arteries above and below; these then split into branches that supply the
    anterior and posterior parts of the trachea. \n\nThe inferior thyroid arteries
    arise just below the isthmus of the thyroid, which sits atop the trachea. \n\nThese
    arteries join (anastamoses) with ascending branches of the bronchial arteries,
    which are direct branches from the aorta, to supply blood to the trachea. \n\nThe
    lymphatic vessels of the trachea drain into the pretracheal nodes that lie in
    front of the trachea, and paratracheal lymph nodes that lie beside it.\n\n\n===
    Development ===\n\nIn the fourth week of development of the human embryo as the
    respiratory bud grows, the trachea separates from the foregut through the formation
    of ridges which eventually separate the trachea from the oesophagus, the tracheoesophageal
    septum. \n\nThis separates the future trachea from the oesophagus and divides
    the foregut tube into the laryngotracheal tube. \n\nBy the start of the fifth
    week, the left and right main bronchi have begin to form, initially as buds at
    the terminal end of the trachea.The trachea is no more than 4mm diameter during
    the first year of life, expanding to its adult diameter of approximately 2cm
    by late childhood. \n\nThe trachea is more circular and more vertical in children
    compared to adults, varies more in size, and also varies more in its position
    in relation to its surrounding structures.\n\n\n=== Microanatomy ===\n\nThe trachea
    is lined with a layer of interspersed layers of column-shaped cells with cilia.
    \n\nThe epithelium contains goblet cells, which are glandular, column-shaped
    cells that produce mucins, the main component of mucus. \n\nMucus helps to moisten
    and protect the airways. \n\nMucus lines the ciliated cells of the trachea to
    trap inhaled foreign particles that the cilia then waft upward toward the larynx
    and then the pharynx where it can be either swallowed into the stomach or expelled
    as phlegm. \n\nThis self-clearing mechanism is termed mucociliary clearance.The
    trachea is surrounded by 16 to 20 rings of hyaline cartilage; these 'rings' are
    incomplete and C-shaped. \n\nTwo or more of the cartilages often unite, partially
    or completely, and they are sometimes bifurcated at their extremities. \n\nThe
    rings are generally highly elastic but they may calcify with age.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n==
    Function ==\n\nThe trachea is one part of the respiratory tree that is a conduit
    for air to pass through on its way to or from the alveoli of the lungs. \n\nThis
    transmits oxygen to the body and removes carbon dioxide.\n\n\n== Use in killing
    humans ==\n\nCrushing the trachea is a common tactic for temporarily or permanently
    disabling another human and is taught in the military, martial arts and police
    forces around the world.\n\n\n== Clinical significance ==\n\n\n\n=== Inflammation
    and infection ===\n\nInflammation of the trachea is known as tracheitis, usually
    due to an infection. \n\nIt is usually caused by viral infections, with bacterial
    infections occurring almost entirely in children. \n\nMost commonly, infections
    occur with inflammation of other parts of the respiratory tract, such as the
    larynx and bronchi, known as croup, however bacterial infections may also affect
    the trachea alone, although they are often associated with a recent viral infection.
    \n\nViruses that cause croup are generally the parainfluenza viruses 1\u20133,
    with influenza viruses A and B also causing croup, but usually causing more serious
    infections; bacteria may also cause croup and include Staphylococcus aureus,
    Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Moraxella catarrhalis. \n\nCauses
    of bacterial infection of the trachea are most commonly Staphylococcus aureus
    and Streptococcus pneumoniae. \n\nIn patients who are in hospital, additional
    bacteria that may cause tracheitis include Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae,
    and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.A person affected with tracheitis may start with symptoms
    that suggest an upper respiratory tract infection such as a cough, sore throat,
    or coryzal symptoms such as a runny nose. \n\nFevers may develop and an affected
    child may develop difficulty breathing and sepsis. \n\nSwelling of the airway
    can cause narrowing of the airway, causing a hoarse breathing sound called stridor,
    or even cause complete blockage. \n\nUnfortunately, up to 80% of people affected
    by bacterial tracheitis require the use of mechanical ventilation, and treatment
    may include endoscopy for the purposes of acquiring microbiological specimens
    for culture and sensitivity, as well as removal of any dead tissue associated
    with the infection. \n\nTreatment in such situations usually includes antibiotics.\n\n\n===
    Narrowing ===\n\n\nA trachea may be narrowed or compressed, usually a result
    of enlarged nearby lymph nodes; cancers of the trachea or nearby structures;
    large thyroid goitres; or rarely as a result of other processes such as unusually
    swollen blood vessels. \n\nScarring from tracheobronchial injury or intubation;
    or inflammation associated with granulomatosis with polyangiitis may also cause
    a narrowing of the trachea (tracheal stenosis). \n\nObstruction invariably causes
    a harsh breathing sound known as stridor. \n\nA camera inserted via the mouth
    down into the trachea, called bronchoscopy, may be performed to investigate the
    cause of an obstruction. \n\nManagement of obstructions depends on the cause.
    \n\nObstructions as a result of malignancy may be managed with surgery, chemotherapy
    or radiotherapy. \n\nA stent may be inserted over the obstruction. \n\nBenign
    lesions, such as narrowing resulting from scarring, are likely to be surgically
    excised.One cause of narrowing is tracheomalacia, which is the tendency for the
    trachea to collapse when there is increased external pressure, such as when airflow
    is increased during breathing in or out, due to decreased compliance. \n\nIt
    can be due to congenital causes, or due to things that develop after birth, such
    as compression from nearby masses or swelling, or trauma. \n\nCongenital tracheomalacia
    can occur by itself or in association with other abnormalities such as bronchomalacia
    or laryngomalacia, and abnormal connections between the trachea and the oesophagus,
    amongst others. \n\nCongenital tracheomalacia often improves without specific
    intervention; when required, interventions may include beta agonists and muscarinic
    agonists, which enhance the tone of the smooth muscle surrounding the trachea;
    positive pressure ventilation, or surgery, which may include the placement of
    a stent, or the removal of the affected part of the trachea. \n\nIn dogs, particularly
    miniature dogs and toy dogs, tracheomalacia, as well as bronchomalacia, can lead
    to tracheal collapse, which often presents with a honking goose-like cough.\n\n\n===
    Intubation ===\n\n\nTracheal intubation refers to the insertion of a tube down
    the trachea. \n\nThis procedure is commonly performed during surgery, in order
    to ensure a person receives enough oxygen when sedated. \n\nThe catheter is connected
    to a machine that monitors the airflow, oxygenation and several other metrics.
    \n\nThis is often one of the responsibilities of an anaesthetist during surgery.\nIn
    an emergency, or when tracheal intubation is deemed impossible, a tracheotomy
    is often performed to insert a tube for ventilation, usually when needed for
    particular types of surgery to be carried out so that the airway can be kept
    open. \n\nThe provision of the opening via a tracheotomy is called a tracheostomy.
    \n\nAnother method procedure can be carried, in an emergency situation, and this
    is a cricothyrotomy.\n\n\n=== Congenital disorders ===\n\n\nTracheal agenesis
    is a rare birth defect in which the trachea fails to develop. \n\nThe defect
    is usually fatal though sometimes surgical intervention has been successful.\nA
    tracheoesophageal fistula is a congenital defect in which the trachea and esophagus
    are abnormally connected (a fistula). \n\nThis is because of abnormalities in
    the separation between the trachea and oesophagus during development. \n\nThis
    occurs in approximately 1 in 3000 births, and the most common abnormalities is
    a separation of the upper and lower ends of the oesophagus, with the upper end
    finishing in a closed pouch. \n\nOther abnormalities may be associated with this,
    including cardiac abnormalities, or VACTERL syndrome. \n\nSuch fistulas may be
    detected before a baby is born because of excess amniotic fluid; after birth,
    they are often associated with pneumonitis and pneumonia because of aspiration
    of food contents. \n\nCongenital fistulas are often treated by surgical repair.
    \n\nIn adults, fistulas may occur because of erosion into the trachea from nearby
    malignant tumours, which erode into both the trachea and the oesophagus. \n\nInitially,
    these often result in coughing from swallowed contents of the oesophagus that
    are aspirated through the trachea, often progressing to fatal pneumonia; unfortunately,
    there is rarely a curative treatment. \n\nA tracheo-oesophageal puncture is a
    surgically created hole between the trachea and the esophagus in a person who
    has had their larynx removed. \n\nAir travels upwards from the surgical connection
    to the upper oesophagus and the pharynx, creating vibrations that create sound
    that can be used for speech. \n\nThe purpose of the puncture is to restore a
    person's ability to speak after the vocal cords have been removed.Sometimes as
    an anatomical variation one or more of the tracheal rings are formed as complete
    rings, rather than horseshoe shaped rings. \n\nThese O rings are smaller than
    the normal C-shaped rings and can cause narrowing (stenosis) of the trachea,
    resulting in breathing difficulties. \n\nAn operation called a slide tracheoplasty
    can open up the rings and rejoin them as wider rings, shortening the length of
    the trachea. \n\nSlide tracheoplasty is said to be the best option in treating
    tracheal stenosis.Mounier-Kuhn syndrome is a rare congenital disorder of an abnormally
    enlarged trachea, characterised by absent elastic fibres, smooth muscle thinning,
    and a tendency to get recurrent respiratory tract infections.\n\n\n=== Replacement
    ===\n\nFrom 2008, operations have experimentally replaced tracheas, with those
    grown from stem cells, or with synthetic substitutes, however this is regarded
    as experimental and there is no standardised method. \n\nDifficulties with ensuring
    adequate blood supply to the replaced trachea is considered a major challenge
    to any replacement. \n\nAdditionally, no evidence has been found to support the
    placement of stem cells taken from bone marrow on the trachea as a way of stimulating
    tissue regeneration, and such a method remains hypothetical.In January 2021,
    surgeons at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York performed the first complete trachea
    transplantation. \n\nThe 18-hour procedure included harvesting a trachea from
    a donor and implanting it in the patient, connecting numerous veins and arteries
    to provide sufficient blood flow to the organ.\n\n\n== Other animals ==\n\nAllowing
    for variations in the length of the neck, the trachea in other mammals is, in
    general, similar to that in humans. \n\nGenerally, it is also similar to the
    reptilian trachea.\n\n\n=== Vertebrates ===\n\nIn birds, the trachea runs from
    the pharynx to the syrinx, from which the primary bronchi diverge. \n\nSwans
    have an unusually elongated trachea, part of which is coiled beneath the sternum;
    this may act as a resonator to amplify sound. \n\nIn some birds, the tracheal
    rings are complete, and may even be ossified.In amphibians, the trachea is normally
    extremely short, and leads directly into the lungs, without clear primary bronchi.
    \n\nA longer trachea is, however, found in some long-necked salamanders, and
    in caecilians. \n\nWhile there are irregular cartilagenous nodules on the amphibian
    trachea, these do not form the rings found in amniotes.The only vertebrates to
    have lungs, but no trachea, are the lungfish and the Polypterus, in which the
    lungs arise directly from the pharynx.\n\n\n=== Invertebrates ===\n\n\nThe word
    trachea is used to define a very different organ in invertebrates than in vertebrates.
    \n\nInsects have an open respiratory system made up of spiracles, tracheae, and
    tracheoles to transport metabolic gases to and from tissues. \n\nThe distribution
    of spiracles can vary greatly among the many orders of insects, but in general
    each segment of the body can have only one pair of spiracles, each of which connects
    to an atrium and has a relatively large tracheal tube behind it. \n\nThe tracheae
    are invaginations of the cuticular exoskeleton that branch (anastomose) throughout
    the body with diameters from only a few micrometres up to 0.8 mm. \n\nDiffusion
    of oxygen and carbon dioxide takes place across the walls of the smallest tubes,
    called tracheoles, which penetrate tissues and even indent individual cells.
    \n\nGas may be conducted through the respiratory system by means of active ventilation
    or passive diffusion. \n\nUnlike vertebrates, insects do not generally carry
    oxygen in their haemolymph.\nThis is one of the factors that may limit their
    size.\nA tracheal tube may contain ridge-like circumferential rings of taenidia
    in various geometries such as loops or helices. \n\nTaenidia provide strength
    and flexibility to the trachea. \n\nIn the head, thorax, or abdomen, tracheae
    may also be connected to air sacs. \n\nMany insects, such as grasshoppers and
    bees, which actively pump the air sacs in their abdomen, are able to control
    the flow of air through their body. \n\nIn some aquatic insects, the tracheae
    exchange gas through the body wall directly, in the form of a gill, or function
    essentially as normal, via a plastron. \n\nNote that despite being internal,
    the tracheae of arthropods are lined with cuticular tissue and are shed during
    moulting (ecdysis).\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trachea"

  descriptionText: "\n\nDUCTUS DEFERENS/VAS DEFERENS\n\n\nThe vas deferens, or ductus
    deferens, is part of the male reproductive system of many vertebrates. \n\nThe
    ducts transport sperm from the epididymis to the ejaculatory ducts in anticipation
    of ejaculation. \n\nThe vas deferens is a partially coiled tube which exits the
    abdominal cavity through the inguinal canal.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nVas deferens
    is Latin, meaning \"carrying-away vessel\"; the plural version is vasa deferentia.
    \n\nDuctus deferens is also Latin, meaning \"carrying-away duct\"; the plural
    version is ductus deferentes.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThere are two vasa deferentia,
    connecting the left and right epididymis with the seminal vesicles to form the
    ejaculatory duct in order to move sperm. \n\nIn humans, each tube is about 30
    centimeters (1 ft) long, 3 to 5 mm (0.118 to 0.197 inches) in diameter and is
    muscular (surrounded by smooth muscle). \n\nIts epithelium is pseudostratified
    columnar epithelium lined by stereocilia.\nThey are part of the spermatic cords.\n\n\n===
    Blood supply ===\n\nThe vas deferens is supplied by an accompanying artery (artery
    of vas deferens). \n\nThis artery normally arises from the superior (sometimes
    inferior) vesical artery, a branch of the internal iliac artery.\n\n\n=== Nerve
    supply ===\n\nThe vas deferens is innervated by a variety of different types
    of nerve ending. \n\nAdrenergic synapses are found in the smooth muscle layers.
    \n\nCholinergic synapses and vasoactive intestinal peptide synapses are found
    in the connective tissue of the mucosa. \n\nNoradrenergic synapses may also be
    present in the vas deferens.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\nDuring ejaculation, the smooth
    muscle in the walls of the vas deferens contracts reflexively, thus propelling
    the sperm forward. \n\nThis is also known as peristalsis. \n\nThe sperm is transferred
    from each vas deferens into the urethra, partially mixing with secretions from
    the male accessory sex glands such as the seminal vesicles, prostate gland and
    the bulbourethral glands, which form the bulk of semen.\n\n\n== Clinical significance
    ==\n\n\n\n=== Contraception ===\n\nA vasectomy is a method of contraception in
    which the vasa deferentia are permanently cut, though in some cases it can be
    reversed. \n\nA modern variation, which is also known as a vasectomy even though
    it does not include cutting the vas, involves injecting an obstructive material
    into the ductus to block the flow of sperm.\n\nInvestigational attempts for male
    contraception have focused on the vas with the use of the intra vas device and
    reversible inhibition of sperm under guidance.\n\n\n=== Disease ===\n\nThe vas
    deferens may be obstructed, or it may be completely absent in a condition known
    as congenital absence of the vas deferens (CAVD, a potential feature of cystic
    fibrosis), causing male infertility. \n\nAcquired obstructions can occur due
    to infections. \n\nTo treat these causes of male infertility, sperm can be harvested
    by testicular sperm extraction (TESE), microsurgical epididymal sperm aspiration
    (MESA), or other methods of collecting sperm cells directly from the testicle
    or epididymis.\n\n\n=== Uses in pharmacology and physiology ===\n\nThe vas deferens
    has a dense sympathetic innervation, making it a useful system for studying sympathetic
    nerve function and for studying drugs that modify neurotransmission.It has been
    used:\n\n-as a bioassay for the discovery of enkephalins, the endogenous opiates.\n\n-to
    demonstrate quantal transmission from sympathetic nerve terminals.\n\n-as the
    first direct measure of free Ca2+ concentration in a postganglionic nerve terminal.\n\n-to
    develop an optical method for monitoring packeted transmission (similar to quantal
    transmission).\n\n\n== Other animals ==\n\nMost vertebrates have some form of
    duct to transfer the sperm from the testes to the urethra. \n\nIn cartilaginous
    fish and amphibians, sperm is carried through the archinephric duct, which also
    partially helps to transport urine from the kidneys. \n\nIn teleosts, there is
    a distinct sperm duct, separate from the ureters, and often called the vas deferens,
    although probably not truly homologous with that in humans. \n\nThe vas deferens
    loops over the ureter in placental mammals, but not in marsupial mammals.\n\nIn
    cartilaginous fishes, the part of the archinephric duct closest to the testis
    is coiled up to form an epididymis. \n\nBelow this are a number of small glands
    secreting components of the seminal fluid. \n\nThe final portion of the duct
    also receives ducts from the kidneys in most species.In amniotes, however, the
    archinephric duct has become a true vas deferens, and is used only for conducting
    sperm, never urine. \n\nAs in cartilaginous fish, the upper part of the duct
    forms the epididymis. \n\nIn many species, the vas deferens ends in a small sac
    for storing sperm.The only vertebrates to lack any structure resembling a vas
    deferens are the primitive jawless fishes, which release sperm directly into
    the body cavity, and then into the surrounding water through a simple opening
    in the body wall.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vas_deferens"

  descriptionText: "\n\nTESTIS/\nTESTICLE\n\n\nTesticle or testis (plural testes)
    is the male reproductive gland or gonad in all animals, including humans. \n\nIt
    is homologous to the female ovary. \n\nThe functions of the testes are to produce
    both sperm and androgens, primarily testosterone. \n\nTestosterone release is
    controlled by the anterior pituitary luteinizing hormone, whereas sperm production
    is controlled both by the anterior pituitary follicle-stimulating hormone and
    gonadal testosterone.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\n=== Appearance ===\n\nMales have
    two testicles of similar size contained within the scrotum, which is an extension
    of the abdominal wall. \n\nScrotal asymmetry is not unusual: one testicle extends
    farther down into the scrotum than the other due to differences in the anatomy
    of the vasculature.\n\n\n=== Measurement ===\n\nThe volume of the testicle can
    be estimated by palpating it and comparing it to ellipsoids of known sizes. \n\nAnother
    method is to use calipers (an orchidometer) or a ruler either on the person or
    on an ultrasound image to obtain the three measurements of the x, y, and z axes
    (length, depth and width). \n\nThese measurements can then be used to calculate
    the volume, using the formula for the volume of an ellipsoid: \n\nAn average
    adult testicle measures up to 5 cm \xD7 2 cm \xD7 3 cm (2 in \xD7 3\u20444 in
    \xD7 1+1\u20444 in). \n\nThe Tanner scale for the maturity of male genitals assigns
    a maturity stage to the calculated volume ranging from stage I, a volume of less
    than 1.5 cm3; to stage V, a volume greater than 20 cm3. \n\nNormal volume is
    15 to 25 cm3; the average is 18 cm3 per testis (range 12\u201330 cm3).\n\n\n===
    Internal structure ===\n\n==== Duct system ====\n\nThe testes are covered by
    a tough membranous shell called the tunica albuginea. \n\nWithin the testes are
    very fine coiled tubes called seminiferous tubules. \n\nThe tubules are lined
    with a layer of cells (germ cells) that develop from puberty through old age
    into sperm cells (also known as spermatozoa or male gametes). \n\nThe developing
    sperm travel through the seminiferous tubules to the rete testis located in the
    mediastinum testis, to the efferent ducts, and then to the epididymis where newly
    created sperm cells mature (see spermatogenesis). \n\nThe sperm move into the
    vas deferens, and are eventually expelled through the urethra and out of the
    urethral orifice through muscular contractions.\n\n\n==== Primary cell types
    ====\n\nWithin the seminiferous tubules, the germ cells develop into spermatogonia,
    spermatocytes, spermatids and spermatozoon through the process of spermatogenesis.
    \n\nThe gametes contain DNA for fertilization of an ovum Sertoli cells \u2013
    the true epithelium of the seminiferous epithelium, critical for the support
    of germ cell development into spermatozoa. \n\nSertoli cells secrete inhibin.
    \n\nPeritubular myoid cells surround the seminiferous tubules.Between tubules
    (interstitial cells), exist Leydig cells \u2013 cells localized between seminiferous
    tubules that produce and secrete testosterone and other androgens important for
    sexual development and puberty, secondary sexual characteristics like facial
    hair, sexual behavior and libido. \n\nThey also support spermatogenesis and erectile
    function. \n\nTestosterone controls testicular volume. \nImmature Leydig cells
    and interstitial macrophages and epithelial cells are also present.\n\n\n====
    Blood supply and lymphatic drainage ====\n\nBlood supply and lymphatic drainage
    of the testes and scrotum are distinct:\n\nThe paired testicular arteries arise
    directly from the abdominal aorta and descend through the inguinal canal, while
    the scrotum and the rest of the external genitalia is supplied by the internal
    pudendal artery (itself a branch of the internal iliac artery).\n\nThe testis
    has collateral blood supply from \n1. the cremasteric artery (a branch of the
    inferior epigastric artery, which is a branch of the external iliac artery),
    \nand \n2. the artery to the ductus deferens (a branch of the inferior vesical
    artery, which is a branch of the internal iliac artery). \n\nTherefore, if the
    testicular artery is ligated, e.g., during a Fowler-Stevens orchiopexy for a
    high undescended testis, the testis will usually survive on these other blood
    supplies.\n\nLymphatic drainage of the testes follows the testicular arteries
    back to the paraaortic lymph nodes, while lymph from the scrotum drains to the
    inguinal lymph nodes.\n\n\n==== Layers ====\n\nMany anatomical features of the
    adult testis reflect its developmental origin in the abdomen. \n\nThe layers
    of tissue enclosing each testicle are derived from the layers of the anterior
    abdominal wall. \n\nNotably, the cremasteric muscle arises from the internal
    oblique muscle.\n\n\n==== The blood\u2013testis barrier ====\n\nLarge molecules
    cannot pass from the blood into the lumen of a seminiferous tubule due to the
    presence of tight junctions between adjacent Sertoli cells. \n\nThe spermatogonia
    are in the basal compartment (deep to the level of the tight junctions) and the
    more mature forms such as primary and secondary spermatocytes and spermatids
    are in the adluminal compartment.\n\nThe function of the blood\u2013testis barrier
    may be to prevent an auto-immune reaction. \n\nMature sperm (and their antigens)
    arise long after immune tolerance is established in infancy. \n\nSince sperm
    are antigenically different from self tissue, a male animal can react immunologically
    to his own sperm. \n\nHe is capable of making antibodies against them.\n\nInjection
    of sperm antigens causes inflammation of the testis (auto-immune orchitis) and
    reduced fertility. \n\nThe blood\u2013testis barrier may reduce the likelihood
    that sperm proteins will induce an immune response, reducing fertility and so
    progeny.\n\n\n=== Temperature regulation ===\n\nSpermatogenesis is enhanced at
    temperatures slightly less than core body temperature. \n\nThe spermatogenesis
    is less efficient at lower and higher temperatures than 33 \xB0C. \n\nBecause
    the testes are located outside the body, the smooth tissue of the scrotum can
    move them closer or further away from the body. \n\nThe temperature of the testes
    is maintained at 35 degrees Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit), i.e. two degrees
    below the body temperature of 37 degrees Celsius (98.6 degrees Fahrenheit). \n\nHigher
    temperatures affect spermatogenesis. \n\nThere are a number of mechanisms to
    maintain the testes at the optimum temperature.\n\nThe cremasteric muscle is
    part of the spermatic cord. \n\nWhen this muscle contracts, the cord is shortened
    and the testicle is moved closer up toward the body, which provides slightly
    more warmth to maintain optimal testicular temperature. \n\nWhen cooling is required,
    the cremasteric muscle relaxes and the testicle is lowered away from the warm
    body and is able to cool. \n\nContraction also occurs in response to stress (the
    testicles rise up toward the body in an effort to protect them in a fight).\n\nThe
    cremaster muscle can reflexively raise each testicle individually if properly
    triggered. \n\nThis phenomenon is known as the cremasteric reflex. \n\nThe testicles
    can also be lifted voluntarily using the pubococcygeus muscle, which partially
    activates related muscles.\n\n\n=== Gene and protein expression ===\n\n\nThe
    human genome includes approximately 20,000 protein coding genes: 80% of these
    genes are expressed in adult testes. \n\nThe testes have the highest fraction
    of tissue type-specific genes compared to other organs and tissues: about 1000
    of them are highly specific for the testes, and about 2,200 show an elevated
    pattern of expression here. \n\nA majority of these genes encode for proteins
    that are expressed in the seminiferous tubules and have functions related to
    spermatogenesis. \n\nSperm cells express proteins that result in the development
    of flagella; these same proteins are expressed in the female in cells lining
    the fallopian tube, and cause the development of cilia. \n\nIn other words, sperm
    cell flagella and Fallopian tube cilia are homologous structures. \n\nThe testis-specific
    proteins that show the highest level of expression are protamines.\n\n\n== Development
    ==\n\nThere are two phases in which the testes grow substantially; namely in
    embryonic and pubertal age.\n\n\n=== Embryonic ===\n\n\nDuring mammalian development,
    the gonads are at first capable of becoming either ovaries or testes. \n\nIn
    humans, starting at about week 4 the gonadal rudiments are present within the
    intermediate mesoderm adjacent to the developing kidneys. \n\nAt about week 6,
    sex cords develop within the forming testes. \n\nThese are made up of early Sertoli
    cells that surround and nurture the germ cells that migrate into the gonads shortly
    before sex determination begins. \n\nIn males, the sex-specific gene SRY that
    is found on the Y-chromosome initiates sex determination by downstream regulation
    of sex-determining factors, (such as GATA4, SOX9 and AMH), which leads to development
    of the male phenotype, including directing development of the early bipotential
    gonad down the male path of development.\n\nTestes follow the \"path of descent\"
    from high in the posterior fetal abdomen to the inguinal ring and beyond to the
    inguinal canal and into the scrotum. \n\nIn most cases (97% full-term, 70% preterm),
    both testes have descended by birth. \n\nIn most other cases, only one testis
    fails to descend (cryptorchidism) and that will probably express itself within
    a year.\n\n\n=== Pubertal ===\n\nThe testes grow in response to the start of
    spermatogenesis. \n\nSize depends on lytic function, sperm production (amount
    of spermatogenesis present in testis), interstitial fluid, and Sertoli cell fluid
    production. \n\nAfter puberty, the volume of the testes can be increased by over
    500% as compared to the pre-pubertal size. \n\nTesticles are fully descended
    before one reaches puberty.\n\n\n== Clinical significance ==\n\n=== Protection
    and injury ===\n\n\nThe testicles are well known to be very sensitive to impact
    and injury. \n\nThe pain involved travels up from each testicle into the abdominal
    cavity, via the spermatic plexus, which is the primary nerve of each testicle.
    \n\nThis will cause pain in the hip and the back. \nThe pain usually goes away
    in a few minutes.\n\nTesticular torsion is a medical emergency.\n\nTesticular
    rupture is a medical emergency caused by blunt force impact, sharp edge, or piercing
    impact to one or both testicles, which can lead to necrosis of the testis in
    as little as 30 minutes.\n\nPenetrating injuries to the scrotum may cause castration,
    or physical separation or destruction of the testes, possibly along with part
    or all of the penis, which results in total sterility if the testicles are not
    reattached quickly.\n\nSome jockstraps are designed to provide support to the
    testicles.\n\n\n=== Diseases and conditions ===\n\n-Testicular cancer and other
    neoplasms \u2013 \n\nTo improve the chances of catching possible cases of testicular
    cancer or other health issues early, regular testicular self-examination is recommended.\n\n-Varicocele,
    swollen vein(s) from the testes, usually affecting the left side, the testis
    usually being normal.\n\n-Hydrocele testis, swelling around testes caused by
    accumulation of clear liquid within a membranous sac, the testis usually being
    normal\n\n-Spermatocele, a retention cyst of a tubule of the rete testis or the
    head of the epididymis distended with barely watery fluid that contains spermatozoa.\n\n-Endocrine
    disorders can also affect the size and function of the testis.\n\n-Certain inherited
    conditions involving mutations in key developmental genes also impair testicular
    descent, resulting in abdominal or inguinal testes which remain nonfunctional
    and may become cancerous. \n\n-Other genetic conditions can result in the loss
    of the Wolffian ducts and allow for the persistence of M\xFCllerian ducts. \n\n-Both
    excess and deficient levels of estrogens can disrupt spermatogenesis and cause
    infertility.\n\n-Bell-clapper deformity is a deformity in which the testicle
    is not attached to the scrotal walls, and can rotate freely on the spermatic
    cord within the tunica vaginalis. \n\nIt is the most common underlying cause
    of testicular torsion.\n\n-Orchitis inflammation of the testicles\n-Epididymitis,
    a painful inflammation of the epididymis or epididymides frequently caused by
    bacterial infection but sometimes of unknown origin.\n-Anorchia, the absence
    of one or both testicles.\n-Cryptorchidism or \"undescended testicles\", when
    the testicle does not descend into the scrotum of the infant boy.\n-Testicular
    enlargement is an unspecific sign of various testicular diseases, and can be
    defined as a testicular size of more than 5 cm (long axis) \xD7 3 cm (short axis).\n-Blue
    balls is a slang term for a temporary fluid congestion in the testicles and prostate
    region caused by prolonged sexual arousal.\n-Testicular prostheses are available
    to mimic the appearance and feel of one or both testicles, when absent as from
    injury or as treatment in association to gender dysphoria. \n\nThere have also
    been some instances of their implantation in dogs.\n\n\n=== Effects of exogenous
    hormones ===\n\nTo some extent, it is possible to change testicular size. \n\nShort
    of direct injury or subjecting them to adverse conditions, e.g., higher temperature
    than they are normally accustomed to, they can be shrunk by competing against
    their intrinsic hormonal function through the use of externally administered
    steroidal hormones. \n\nSteroids taken for muscle enhancement (especially anabolic
    steroids) often have the undesired side effect of testicular shrinkage.\n\nSimilarly,
    stimulation of testicular functions via gonadotropic-like hormones may enlarge
    their size. \n\nTestes may shrink or atrophy during hormone replacement therapy
    or through chemical castration.\n\nIn all cases, the loss in testes volume corresponds
    with a loss of spermatogenesis.\n\n\n== Society and culture ==\n\n\nThe testicles
    of calves, lambs, roosters, turkeys, and other animals are eaten in many parts
    of the world, often under euphemistic culinary names. \n\nTesticles are a by-product
    of the castration of young animals raised for meat, so they were probably a late-spring
    seasonal specialty, though nowadays they are generally frozen and available year-round.\n\nAs
    early as 330 BC, Aristotle prescribed the ligation (tying off) of the left testicle
    in men wishing to have boys. \n\nIn the Middle Ages, men who wanted a boy sometimes
    had their left testicle removed. \n\nThis was because people believed that the
    right testicle made \"boy\" sperm and the left made \"girl\" sperm.\n\n\n== Etymology
    and slang ==\n\nOne theory about the etymology of the word testis is based on
    Roman law. \n\nThe original Latin word testis, \"witness\", was used in the firmly
    established legal principle \"Testis unus, testis nullus\" (one witness [equals]
    no witness), meaning that testimony by any one person in court was to be disregarded
    unless corroborated by the testimony of at least another. \n\nThis led to the
    common practice of producing two witnesses, bribed to testify the same way in
    cases of lawsuits with ulterior motives. \n\nSince such \"witnesses\" always
    came in pairs, the meaning was accordingly extended, often in the diminutive
    (testiculus, testiculi).\n\nAnother theory says that testis is influenced by
    a loan translation, from Greek parastat\u0113s \"defender (in law), supporter\"
    that is \"two glands side by side\".In slang, the testes are usually referred
    to as \"balls\" as a reference to blue balls. \n\nFrequently, \"nuts\" (sometimes
    intentionally misspelled as \"nutz\") are also a slang term for the testes due
    to the geometric resemblance, as evidenced by the various usages of the term
    \"Deez Nuts\", which include a satirical political candidate in 2016.\n\n\n==
    Other animals ==\n\n=== External appearance ===\n\nIn sharks, the testicle on
    the right side is usually larger, and in many bird and mammal species, the left
    may be the larger. \n\nThe primitive jawless fish have only a single testis,
    located in the midline of the body, although even this forms from the fusion
    of paired structures in the embryo.\n\nIn seasonal breeders, the weight of the
    testes often increases during the breeding season. \n\nThe testicles of a dromedary
    camel are 7\u201310 cm (2.8\u20133.9 in) long, 4.5 cm (1.8 in) deep and 5 cm
    (2.0 in) in width. \n\nThe right testicle is often smaller than the left.\n\n\n===
    Location ===\n\n==== Internal ====\n\nThe basal condition for mammals is to have
    internal testes. \n\nThe testes of monotremes, xenarthrans, and elephants remain
    within the abdomen. \n\nThere are also some marsupials with external testes and
    Boreoeutherian mammals with internal testes, such as the rhinoceros. \n\nCetaceans
    such as whales and dolphins also have internal testes. \n\nAs external testes
    would increase drag in the water they have internal testes which are kept cool
    by special circulatory systems that cool the arterial blood going to the testes
    by placing the arteries near veins bringing cooled venous blood from the skin.
    \n\nIn odobenids and phocids, the location of the testes is para-abdominal, though
    otariids have scrotal testes.\n\n\n==== External ====\n\nBoreoeutherian land
    mammals, the large group of mammals that includes humans, have externalized testes.
    \n\nTheir testes function best at temperatures lower than their core body temperature.
    \n\nTheir testes are located outside of the body, suspended by the spermatic
    cord within the scrotum.\n\nThere are several hypotheses why most boreotherian
    mammals have external testes which operate best at a temperature that is slightly
    less than the core body temperature, e.g. that it is stuck with enzymes evolved
    in a colder temperature due to external testes evolving for different reasons,
    that the lower temperature of the testes simply is more efficient for sperm production.\n\n   
    1) More efficient. \n\nThe classic hypothesis is that cooler temperature of the
    testes allows for more efficient fertile spermatogenesis. \n\nIn other words,
    there are no possible enzymes operating at normal core body temperature that
    are as efficient as the ones evolved, at least none appearing in our evolution
    so far.\n\nThe early mammals had lower body temperatures and thus their testes
    worked efficiently within their body. \n\nHowever it is argued that boreotherian
    mammals have higher body temperatures than the other mammals and had to develop
    external testes to keep them cool. \n\nIt is argued that those mammals with internal
    testes, such as the monotremes, armadillos, sloths, elephants, and rhinoceroses,
    have a lower core body temperatures than those mammals with external testes.\n\nHowever,
    the question remains why birds despite having very high core body temperatures
    have internal testes and did not evolve external testes. \n\nIt was once theorized
    that birds used their air sacs to cool the testes internally, but later studies
    revealed that birds' testes are able to function at core body temperature.\n\nSome
    mammals which have seasonal breeding cycles keep their testes internal until
    the breeding season at which point their testes descend and increase in size
    and become external.\n\n    2) Irreversible adaptation to sperm competition.
    \n\nIt has been suggested that the ancestor of the boreoeutherian mammals was
    a small mammal that required very large testes (perhaps rather like those of
    a hamster) for sperm competition and thus had to place its testes outside the
    body. \n\nThis led to enzymes involved in spermatogenesis, spermatogenic DNA
    polymerase beta and recombinase activities evolving a unique temperature optimum,
    slightly less than core body temperature. \n\nWhen the boreoeutherian mammals
    then diversified into forms that were larger and/or did not require intense sperm
    competition they still produced enzymes that operated best at cooler temperatures
    and had to keep their testes outside the body. \n\nThis position is made less
    parsimonious by the fact that the kangaroo, a non-boreoeutherian mammal, has
    external testicles. \n\nThe ancestors of kangaroos might, separately from boreotherian
    mammals, have also been subject to heavy sperm competition and thus developed
    external testes, however, kangaroo external testes are suggestive of a possible
    adaptive function for external testes in large animals.\n\n    3) Protection
    from abdominal cavity pressure changes. \n\nOne argument for the evolution of
    external testes is that it protects the testes from abdominal cavity pressure
    changes caused by jumping and galloping.\n\n    4) Protection against DNA damage.
    \n\nMild, transient scrotal heat stress causes DNA damage, reduced fertility
    and abnormal embryonic development in mice. \n\nDNA strand breaks were found
    in spermatocytes recovered from testicles subjected to 40 \xB0C or 42 \xB0C for
    30 minutes. \n\nThese findings suggest that the external location of the testicles
    provides the adaptive benefit of protecting spermatogenic cells from heat-induced
    DNA damage that could otherwise lead to infertility and germline mutation.\n\n\n===
    Size ===\n\nThe relative size of testes is often influenced by mating systems.
    \n\nTesticular size as a proportion of body weight varies widely. \n\nIn the
    mammalian kingdom, there is a tendency for testicular size to correspond with
    multiple mates (e.g., harems, polygamy). \n\nProduction of testicular output
    sperm and spermatic fluid is also larger in polygamous animals, possibly a spermatogenic
    competition for survival. \n\nThe testes of the right whale are likely to be
    the largest of any animal, each weighing around 500 kg (1,100 lb).\n\nAmong the
    Hominidae, gorillas have little female promiscuity and sperm competition and
    the testes are small compared to body weight (0.03%). \n\nChimpanzees have high
    promiscuity and large testes compared to body weight (0.3%). \n\nHuman testicular
    size falls between these extremes (0.08%).Testis weight also varies in seasonal
    breeders like red foxes, golden jackals and coyotes.\n\n\n=== Internal structure
    ===\n\nUnder a tough membranous shell called the tunica albuginea, the testis
    of amniotes, as well as some teleost fish, contains very fine coiled tubes called
    seminiferous tubules.\n\nAmphibians and most fish do not possess seminiferous
    tubules. \n\nInstead, the sperm are produced in spherical structures called sperm
    ampullae. \n\nThese are seasonal structures, releasing their contents during
    the breeding season, and then being reabsorbed by the body. \n\nBefore the next
    breeding season, new sperm ampullae begin to form and ripen. \n\nThe ampullae
    are otherwise essentially identical to the seminiferous tubules in higher vertebrates,
    including the same range of cell types.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testicle"

  descriptionText: "\n\nDESCENDING COLON/\nLARGE INTESTINE\n\n\nThe large intestine,
    also known as the large bowel, is the last part of the gastrointestinal tract
    and of the digestive system in vertebrates. \n\nWater is absorbed here and the
    remaining waste material is stored as feces before being removed by defecation.\n\nThe
    colon is the largest portion of the large intestine, so many mentions of the
    large intestine and colon overlap in meaning whenever precision is not the focus.
    \n\nMost sources define the large intestine as the combination of the cecum,
    colon, rectum, and anal canal. \n\nSome other sources exclude the anal canal.In
    humans, the large intestine begins in the right iliac region of the pelvis, just
    at or below the waist, where it is joined to the end of the small intestine at
    the cecum, via the ileocecal valve. \n\nIt then continues as the colon ascending
    the abdomen, across the width of the abdominal cavity as the transverse colon,
    and then descending to the rectum and its endpoint at the anal canal. \n\nOverall,
    in humans, the large intestine is about 1.5 metres (5 ft) long, which is about
    one-fifth of the whole length of the gastrointestinal tract.\n\n\n== Structure
    ==\n\nThe colon is the last part of the digestive system. \n\nIt has a segmented
    appearance due to a series of saccules called haustra. \n\nIt extracts water
    and salt from solid wastes before they are eliminated from the body and is the
    site in which flora-aided (largely bacterial) fermentation of unabsorbed material
    occurs. \n\nUnlike the small intestine, the colon does not play a major role
    in absorption of foods and nutrients. \n\nAbout 1.5 litres or 45 ounces of water
    arrives in the colon each day.\n\nThe length of the average adult human colon
    is 65 inches or 166 cm (range of 80 to 313 cm) for males, and 61 inches or 155
    cm (range of 80 to 214 cm) for females.\n\n\n=== Sections ===\n\n\nIn mammals,
    the colon consists of six sections: the cecum, the ascending colon, the transverse
    colon, the descending colon, the sigmoid colon, and the rectum.Sections of the
    colon are:\n\n-The cecum including the appendix\n-The ascending colon\n-The transverse
    colon including the colic flexures and transverse mesocolon\n-The descending
    colon\n-The sigmoid colon \u2013 the s-shaped region of the large intestine\n-The
    rectum\n\nThe parts of the colon are either intraperitoneal or behind it in the
    retroperitoneum. \n\nRetroperitoneal organs, in general, do not have a complete
    covering of peritoneum, so they are fixed in location. \n\nIntraperitoneal organs
    are completely surrounded by peritoneum and are therefore mobile. \n\nOf the
    colon, the ascending colon, descending colon and rectum are retroperitoneal,
    while the cecum, appendix, transverse colon and sigmoid colon are intraperitoneal.
    \n\nThis is important as it affects which organs can be easily accessed during
    surgery, such as a laparotomy.\n\nIn terms of diameter, the cecum is the widest,
    averaging slightly less than 9 cm in healthy individuals, and the transverse
    colon averages less than 6 cm in diameter. \n\nThe descending and sigmoid colon
    are slightly smaller, with the sigmoid colon averaging 4\u20135 cm (1.6\u20132.0
    in) in diameter. \n\nDiameters larger than certain thresholds for each colonic
    section can be diagnostic for megacolon.\n\n\n==== Cecum and appendix ====\n\nThe
    cecum is the first section of the colon and involved in the digestion, while
    the appendix which develops embryologically from it, is a structure of the colon,
    not involved in digestion and considered to be part of the gut-associated lymphoid
    tissue. \n\nThe function of the appendix is uncertain, but some sources believe
    that the appendix has a role in housing a sample of the colon's microflora, and
    is able to help to repopulate the colon with bacteria if the microflora has been
    damaged during the course of an immune reaction. \n\nThe appendix has also been
    shown to have a high concentration of lymphatic cells.\n\n\n==== Ascending colon
    ====\n\nThe ascending colon is the first of four main sections of the large intestine.
    \n\nIt is connected to the small intestine by a section of bowel called the cecum.
    \n\nThe ascending colon runs upwards through the abdominal cavity toward the
    transverse colon for approximately eight inches (20 cm).\n\nOne of the main functions
    of the colon is to remove the water and other key nutrients from waste material
    and recycle it. \n\nAs the waste material exits the small intestine through the
    ileocecal valve, it will move into the cecum and then to the ascending colon
    where this process of extraction starts. \n\nThe waste material is pumped upwards
    toward the transverse colon by peristalsis. \n\nThe ascending colon is sometimes
    attached to the appendix via Gerlach's valve. \n\nIn ruminants, the ascending
    colon is known as the spiral colon.\nTaking into account all ages and sexes,
    colon cancer occurs here most often (41%).\n\n\n==== Transverse colon ====\n\nThe
    transverse colon is the part of the colon from the hepatic flexure, also known
    as the right colic, (the turn of the colon by the liver) to the splenic flexure
    also known as the left colic, (the turn of the colon by the spleen). \n\nThe
    transverse colon hangs off the stomach, attached to it by a large fold of peritoneum
    called the greater omentum. \n\nOn the posterior side, the transverse colon is
    connected to the posterior abdominal wall by a mesentery known as the transverse
    mesocolon.\n\nThe transverse colon is encased in peritoneum, and is therefore
    mobile (unlike the parts of the colon immediately before and after it).\n\nThe
    proximal two-thirds of the transverse colon is perfused by the middle colic artery,
    a branch of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA), while the latter third is supplied
    by branches of the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA). \n\nThe \"watershed\" area
    between these two blood supplies, which represents the embryologic division between
    the midgut and hindgut, is an area sensitive to ischemia.\n\n\n==== Descending
    colon ====\n\nThe descending colon is the part of the colon from the splenic
    flexure to the beginning of the sigmoid colon. \n\nOne function of the descending
    colon in the digestive system is to store feces that will be emptied into the
    rectum. \n\nIt is retroperitoneal in two-thirds of humans. \n\nIn the other third,
    it has a (usually short) mesentery. \n\nThe arterial supply comes via the left
    colic artery. \n\nThe descending colon is also called the distal gut, as it is
    further along the gastrointestinal tract than the proximal gut. \n\nGut flora
    are very dense in this region.\n\n\n==== Sigmoid colon ====\n\nThe sigmoid colon
    is the part of the large intestine after the descending colon and before the
    rectum. \n\nThe name sigmoid means S-shaped (see sigmoid; cf. sigmoid sinus).
    \n\nThe walls of the sigmoid colon are muscular and contract to increase the
    pressure inside the colon, causing the stool to move into the rectum.\n\nThe
    sigmoid colon is supplied with blood from several branches (usually between 2
    and 6) of the sigmoid arteries, a branch of the IMA. \n\nThe IMA terminates as
    the superior rectal artery.\nSigmoidoscopy is a common diagnostic technique used
    to examine the sigmoid colon.\n\n\n==== Rectum ====\n\nThe rectum is the last
    section of the large intestine. \n\nIt holds the formed feces awaiting elimination
    via defecation.\nIt is about 12 cm long.\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\n\nThe cecum
    \u2013 the first part of the large intestine\nTaeniae coli \u2013 three bands
    of smooth muscle\nHaustra \u2013 bulges caused by contraction of taeniae coli\nEpiploic
    appendages \u2013 small fat accumulations on the visceraThe taenia coli run the
    length of the large intestine. \n\nBecause the taenia coli are shorter than the
    large bowel itself, the colon becomes sacculated, forming the haustra of the
    colon which are the shelf-like intraluminal projections.\n\n\n=== Blood supply
    ===\n\nArterial supply to the colon comes from branches of the superior mesenteric
    artery (SMA) and inferior mesenteric artery (IMA). \n\nFlow between these two
    systems communicates via the marginal artery of the colon that runs parallel
    to the colon for its entire length. \n\nHistorically, a structure variously identified
    as the arc of Riolan or meandering mesenteric artery (of Moskowitz) was thought
    to connect the proximal SMA to the proximal IMA. \n\nThis variably present structure
    would be important if either vessel were occluded. \n\nHowever, at least one
    review of the literature questions the existence of this vessel, with some experts
    calling for the abolition of these terms from future medical literature.Venous
    drainage usually mirrors colonic arterial supply, with the inferior mesenteric
    vein draining into the splenic vein, and the superior mesenteric vein joining
    the splenic vein to form the hepatic portal vein that then enters the liver.\n\n\n===
    Lymphatic drainage ===\n\nLymphatic drainage from the ascending colon and proximal
    two-thirds of the transverse colon is to the colic lymph nodes and the superior
    mesenteric lymph nodes, which drain into the cisterna chyli. \n\nThe lymph from
    the distal one-third of the transverse colon, the descending colon, the sigmoid
    colon, and the upper rectum drain into the inferior mesenteric and colic lymph
    nodes. \n\nThe lower rectum to the anal canal above the pectinate line drain
    to the internal iliac nodes. \n\nThe anal canal below the pectinate line drains
    into the superficial inguinal nodes. \n\nThe pectinate line only roughly marks
    this transition.\n\n\n=== Nerve supply ===\n\nSympathetic supply : Superior &
    inferior mesenteric ganglia\nParasympathetic supply : Vagus & pelvic nerves\n\n\n===
    Development ===\n\n\n=== Variation ===\n\nOne variation on the normal anatomy
    of the colon occurs when extra loops form, resulting in a colon that is up to
    five metres longer than normal. \n\nThis condition, referred to as redundant
    colon, typically has no direct major health consequences, though rarely volvulus
    occurs, resulting in obstruction and requiring immediate medical attention. \n\nA
    significant indirect health consequence is that use of a standard adult colonoscope
    is difficult and in some cases impossible when a redundant colon is present,
    though specialized variants on the instrument (including the pediatric variant)
    are useful in overcoming this problem.\n\n\n== Microanatomy ==\n\n\n=== Colonic
    crypts ===\n\n\nThe wall of the large intestine is lined with simple columnar
    epithelium with invaginations. \n\nThe invaginations are called the intestinal
    glands or colonic crypts.\n\nThe colon crypts are shaped like microscopic thick
    walled test tubes with a central hole down the length of the tube (the crypt
    lumen). \n\nFour tissue sections are shown here, two cut across the long axes
    of the crypts and two cut parallel to the long axes. \n\nIn these images the
    cells have been stained by immunohistochemistry to show a brown-orange color
    if the cells produce a mitochondrial protein called cytochrome c oxidase subunit
    I (CCOI). \n\nThe nuclei of the cells (located at the outer edges of the cells
    lining the walls of the crypts) are stained blue-gray with haematoxylin. \n\nAs
    seen in panels C and D, crypts are about 75 to about 110 cells long. \n\nBaker
    et al. found that the average crypt circumference is 23 cells. \n\nThus, by the
    images shown here, there are an average of about 1,725 to 2,530 cells per colonic
    crypt. \n\nNooteboom et al. measuring the number of cells in a small number of
    crypts reported a range of 1,500 to 4,900 cells per colonic crypt. \n\nCells
    are produced at the crypt base and migrate upward along the crypt axis before
    being shed into the colonic lumen days later. \n\nThere are 5 to 6 stem cells
    at the bases of the crypts.\n\nAs estimated from the image in panel A, there
    are about 100 colonic crypts per square millimeter of the colonic epithelium.
    \n\nSince the average length of the human colon is 160.5 cm and the average inner
    circumference of the colon is 6.2 cm, the inner surface epithelial area of the
    human colon has an average area of about 995 cm2, which includes 9,950,000 (close
    to 10 million) crypts.\n\nIn the four tissue sections shown here, many of the
    intestinal glands have cells with a mitochondrial DNA mutation in the CCOI gene
    and appear mostly white, with their main color being the blue-gray staining of
    the nuclei. \n\nAs seen in panel B, a portion of the stem cells of three crypts
    appear to have a mutation in CCOI, so that 40% to 50% of the cells arising from
    those stem cells form a white segment in the cross cut area.\n\nOverall, the
    percent of crypts deficient for CCOI is less than 1% before age 40, but then
    increases linearly with age. \n\nColonic crypts deficient for CCOI in women reaches,
    on average, 18% in women and 23% in men by 80\u201384 years of age.Crypts of
    the colon can reproduce by fission, as seen in panel C, where a crypt is fissioning
    to form two crypts, and in panel B where at least one crypt appears to be fissioning.
    \n\nMost crypts deficient in CCOI are in clusters of crypts (clones of crypts)
    with two or more CCOI-deficient crypts adjacent to each other (see panel D).\n\n\n====
    Mucosa ====\n\nAbout 150 of the many thousands of protein coding genes expressed
    in the large intestine, some are specific to the mucous membrane in different
    regions and include CEACAM7.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\n\nThe large intestine absorbs
    water and any remaining absorbable nutrients from the food before sending the
    indigestible matter to the rectum. \n\nThe colon absorbs vitamins that are created
    by the colonic bacteria, such as thiamine, riboflavin, and vitamin K (especially
    important as the daily ingestion of vitamin K is not normally enough to maintain
    adequate blood coagulation). \n\nIt also compacts feces, and stores fecal matter
    in the rectum until it can be discharged via the anus in defecation.\n\nThe large
    intestine also secretes K+ and Cl-. \n\nChloride secretion increases in cystic
    fibrosis.\nRecycling of various nutrients takes place in colon. \n\nExamples
    include fermentation of carbohydrates, short chain fatty acids, and urea cycling.\n\nThe
    appendix contains a small amount of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue which gives
    the appendix an undetermined role in immunity. \n\nHowever, the appendix is known
    to be important in fetal life as it contains endocrine cells that release biogenic
    amines and peptide hormones important for homeostasis during early growth and
    development. \n\nThe appendix can be removed with no apparent damage or consequence
    to the patient.By the time the chyme has reached this tube, most nutrients and
    90% of the water have been absorbed by the body. \n\nAt this point some electrolytes
    like sodium, magnesium, and chloride are left as well as indigestible parts of
    ingested food (e.g., a large part of ingested amylose, starch which has been
    shielded from digestion heretofore, and dietary fiber, which is largely indigestible
    carbohydrate in either soluble or insoluble form). \n\nAs the chyme moves through
    the large intestine, most of the remaining water is removed, while the chyme
    is mixed with mucus and bacteria (known as gut flora), and becomes feces. \n\nThe
    ascending colon receives fecal material as a liquid. \n\nThe muscles of the colon
    then move the watery waste material forward and slowly absorb all the excess
    water, causing the stools to gradually solidify as they move along into the descending
    colon.\n\nThe bacteria break down some of the fiber for their own nourishment
    and create acetate, propionate, and butyrate as waste products, which in turn
    are used by the cell lining of the colon for nourishment. \n\nNo protein is made
    available. \n\nIn humans, perhaps 10% of the undigested carbohydrate thus becomes
    available, though this may vary with diet; in other animals, including other
    apes and primates, who have proportionally larger colons, more is made available,
    thus permitting a higher portion of plant material in the diet. \n\nThe large
    intestine produces no digestive enzymes \u2014 chemical digestion is completed
    in the small intestine before the chyme reaches the large intestine. \n\nThe
    pH in the colon varies between 5.5 and 7 (slightly acidic to neutral).\n\n\n===
    Standing gradient osmosis ===\n\nWater absorption at the colon typically proceeds
    against a transmucosal osmotic pressure gradient. \n\nThe standing gradient osmosis
    is the reabsorption of water against the osmotic gradient in the intestines.
    \n\nCells occupying the intestinal lining pump sodium ions into the intercellular
    space, raising the osmolarity of the intercellular fluid. \n\nThis hypertonic
    fluid creates an osmotic pressure that drives water into the lateral intercellular
    spaces by osmosis via tight junctions and adjacent cells, which then in turn
    moves across the basement membrane and into the capillaries, while more sodium
    ions are pumped again into the intercellular fluid. \n\nAlthough water travels
    down an osmotic gradient in each individual step, overall, water usually travels
    against the osmotic gradient due to the pumping of sodium ions into the intercellular
    fluid. \n\nThis allows the large intestine to absorb water despite the blood
    in capillaries being hypotonic compared to the fluid within the intestinal lumen.\n\n\n===
    Gut flora ===\n\nThe large intestine houses over 700 species of bacteria that
    perform a variety of functions, as well as fungi, protozoa, and archaea. \n\nSpecies
    diversity varies by geography and diet. \n\nThe microbes in a human distal gut
    often number in the vicinity of 100 trillion, and can weigh around 200 grams
    (0.44 pounds). \n\nThis mass of mostly symbiotic microbes has recently been called
    the latest human organ to be \"discovered\" or in other words, the \"forgotten
    organ\".The large intestine absorbs some of the products formed by the bacteria
    inhabiting this region. \n\nUndigested polysaccharides (fiber) are metabolized
    to short-chain fatty acids by bacteria in the large intestine and absorbed by
    passive diffusion. \n\nThe bicarbonate that the large intestine secretes helps
    to neutralize the increased acidity resulting from the formation of these fatty
    acids.\n\nThese bacteria also produce large amounts of vitamins, especially vitamin
    K and biotin (a B vitamin), for absorption into the blood. \n\nAlthough this
    source of vitamins, in general, provides only a small part of the daily requirement,
    it makes a significant contribution when dietary vitamin intake is low. \n\nAn
    individual who depends on absorption of vitamins formed by bacteria in the large
    intestine may become vitamin-deficient if treated with antibiotics that inhibit
    the vitamin producing species of bacteria as well as the intended disease-causing
    bacteria.\n\nOther bacterial products include gas (flatus), which is a mixture
    of nitrogen and carbon dioxide, with small amounts of the gases hydrogen, methane,
    and hydrogen sulfide. \n\nBacterial fermentation of undigested polysaccharides
    produces these. \n\nSome of the fecal odor is due to indoles, metabolized from
    the amino acid tryptophan. \n\nThe normal flora is also essential in the development
    of certain tissues, including the cecum and lymphatics.\n\nThey are also involved
    in the production of cross-reactive antibodies. \n\nThese are antibodies produced
    by the immune system against the normal flora, that are also effective against
    related pathogens, thereby preventing infection or invasion.\n\nThe two most
    prevalent phyla of the colon are firmicutes and bacteroidetes. \n\nThe ratio
    between the two seems to vary widely as reported by the Human Microbiome Project.
    \n\nBacteroides are implicated in the initiation of colitis and colon cancer.
    \n\nBifidobacteria are also abundant, and are often described as 'friendly bacteria'.A
    mucus layer protects the large intestine from attacks from colonic commensal
    bacteria.\n\n\n== Clinical significance ==\n\n\n=== Disease ===\n\nFollowing
    are the most common diseases or disorders of the colon:\n\n\n=== Colonoscopy
    ===\n\nColonoscopy is the endoscopic examination of the large intestine and the
    distal part of the small bowel with a CCD camera or a fiber optic camera on a
    flexible tube passed through the anus. \n\nIt can provide a visual diagnosis
    (e.g. ulceration, polyps) and grants the opportunity for biopsy or removal of
    suspected colorectal cancer lesions. \n\nColonoscopy can remove polyps as small
    as one millimetre or less. \n\nOnce polyps are removed, they can be studied with
    the aid of a microscope to determine if they are precancerous or not. \n\nIt
    takes 15 years or less for a polyp to turn cancerous.\nColonoscopy is similar
    to sigmoidoscopy\u2014the difference being related to which parts of the colon
    each can examine. \n\nA colonoscopy allows an examination of the entire colon
    (1200\u20131500 mm in length). \n\nA sigmoidoscopy allows an examination of the
    distal portion (about 600 mm) of the colon, which may be sufficient because benefits
    to cancer survival of colonoscopy have been limited to the detection of lesions
    in the distal portion of the colon.\n\nA sigmoidoscopy is often used as a screening
    procedure for a full colonoscopy, often done in conjunction with a stool-based
    test such as a fecal occult blood test (FOBT), fecal immunochemical test (FIT),
    or multi-target stool DNA test (Cologuard) or blood-based test, SEPT9 DNA methylation
    test (Epi proColon). \n\nAbout 5% of these screened patients are referred to
    colonoscopy.\n\nVirtual colonoscopy, which uses 2D and 3D imagery reconstructed
    from computed tomography (CT) scans or from nuclear magnetic resonance (MR) scans,
    is also possible, as a totally non-invasive medical test, although it is not
    standard and still under investigation regarding its diagnostic abilities. \n\nFurthermore,
    virtual colonoscopy does not allow for therapeutic maneuvers such as polyp/tumour
    removal or biopsy nor visualization of lesions smaller than 5 millimeters. \n\nIf
    a growth or polyp is detected using CT colonography, a standard colonoscopy would
    still need to be performed. \n\nAdditionally, surgeons have lately been using
    the term pouchoscopy to refer to a colonoscopy of the ileo-anal pouch.\n\n\n==
    Other animals ==\n\nThe large intestine is truly distinct only in tetrapods,
    in which it is almost always separated from the small intestine by an ileocaecal
    valve. \n\nIn most vertebrates, however, it is a relatively short structure running
    directly to the anus, although noticeably wider than the small intestine. \n\nAlthough
    the caecum is present in most amniotes, only in mammals does the remainder of
    the large intestine develop into a true colon.\n\nIn some small mammals, the
    colon is straight, as it is in other tetrapods, but, in the majority of mammalian
    species, it is divided into ascending and descending portions; a distinct transverse
    colon is typically present only in primates. \n\nHowever, the taeniae coli and
    accompanying haustra are not found in either carnivorans or ruminants. \n\nThe
    rectum of mammals (other than monotremes) is derived from the cloaca of other
    vertebrates, and is, therefore, not truly homologous with the \"rectum\" found
    in these species.\n\nIn fish, there is no true large intestine, but simply a
    short rectum connecting the end of the digestive part of the gut to the cloaca.
    \n\nIn sharks, this includes a rectal gland that secretes salt to help the animal
    maintain osmotic balance with the seawater. \n\nThe gland somewhat resembles
    a caecum in structure but is not a homologous structure.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_intestine"

  descriptionText: "\n\nGINGIVA\n/GUMS\n\n\nThe gums or gingiva (plural: gingivae)
    consist of the mucosal tissue that lies over the mandible and maxilla inside
    the mouth. \n\nGum health and disease can have an effect on general health.\n\n\n==
    Structure ==\n\nThe gums are part of the soft tissue lining of the mouth. \n\nThey
    surround the teeth and provide a seal around them. \n\nUnlike the soft tissue
    linings of the lips and cheeks, most of the gums are tightly bound to the underlying
    bone which helps resist the friction of food passing over them. \n\nThus when
    healthy, it presents an effective barrier to the barrage of periodontal insults
    to deeper tissue. \n\nHealthy gums are usually coral pink in light skinned people,
    and may be naturally darker with melanin pigmentation.\n\nChanges in color, particularly
    increased redness, together with swelling and an increased tendency to bleed,
    suggest an inflammation that is possibly due to the accumulation of bacterial
    plaque. \n\nOverall, the clinical appearance of the tissue reflects the underlying
    histology, both in health and disease. \n\nWhen gum tissue is not healthy, it
    can provide a gateway for periodontal disease to advance into the deeper tissue
    of the periodontium, leading to a poorer prognosis for long-term retention of
    the teeth. \n\nBoth the type of periodontal therapy and homecare instructions
    given to patients by dental professionals and restorative care are based on the
    clinical conditions of the tissue.\n\nThe gums are divided anatomically into
    marginal, attached and interdental areas.\n\n\n=== Marginal gums ===\n\nThe marginal
    gum is the edge of the gums surrounding the teeth in collar-like fashion. \n\nIn
    about half of individuals, it is demarcated from the adjacent, attached gums
    by a shallow linear depression, the free gingival groove. \n\nThis slight depression
    on the outer surface of the gum does not correspond to the depth of the gingival
    sulcus but instead to the apical border of the junctional epithelium. \n\nThis
    outer groove varies in depth according to the area of the oral cavity. \n\nThe
    groove is very prominent on mandibular anteriors and premolars.\n\nThe marginal
    gum varies in width from 0.5 to 2.0 mm from the free gingival crest to the attached
    gingiva. \n\nThe marginal gingiva follows the scalloped pattern established by
    the contour of the cementoenamel junction (CEJ) of the teeth. \n\nThe marginal
    gingiva has a more translucent appearance than the attached gingiva, yet has
    a similar clinical appearance, including pinkness, dullness, and firmness. \n\nIn
    contrast, the marginal gingiva lacks the presence of stippling, and the tissue
    is mobile or free from the underlying tooth surface, as can be demonstrated with
    a periodontal probe. \n\nThe marginal gingiva is stabilized by the gingival fibers
    that have no bony support. \n\nThe gingival margin, or free gingival crest, at
    the most superficial part of the marginal gingiva, is also easily seen clinically,
    and its location should be recorded on a patient's chart.\n\n\n=== Attached gum
    ===\n\nThe attached gums are continuous with the marginal gum. \n\nIt is firm,
    resilient, and tightly bound to the underlying periosteum of alveolar bone. \n\nThe
    facial aspect of the attached gum extends to the relatively loose and movable
    alveolar mucosa, from which it is demarcated by the mucogingival junction. \n\nAttached
    gum may present with surface stippling. \n\nThe tissue when dried is dull, firm,
    and immobile, with varying amounts of stippling. \n\nThe width of the attached
    gum varies according to its location. \n\nThe width of the attached gum on the
    facial aspect differs in different areas of the mouth. \n\nIt is generally greatest
    in the incisor region (3.5 to 4.5 mm in the maxilla and 3.3 to 3.9 mm in the
    mandible) and less in the posterior segments, with the least width in the first
    premolar area (1.9 mm in the maxilla and 1.8 mm in the mandible). \n\nHowever,
    certain levels of attached gum may be necessary for the stability of the underlying
    root of the tooth.\n\n\n=== Interdental gum ===\n\nThe interdental gum lies between
    the teeth. \n\nThey occupy the gingival embrasure, which is the interproximal
    space beneath the area of tooth contact. \n\nThe interdental papilla can be pyramidal
    or have a \"col\" shape. \n\nAttached gums are resistant to the forces of chewing
    and covered in keratin.\n\nThe col varies in depth and width, depending on the
    expanse of the contacting tooth surfaces. \n\nThe epithelium covering the col
    consists of the marginal gum of the adjacent teeth, except that it is nonkeratinized.
    \n\nIt is mainly present in the broad interdental gingiva of the posterior teeth,
    and generally is not present with those interproximal tissue associated with
    anterior teeth because the latter tissue is narrower. \n\nIn the absence of contact
    between adjacent teeth, the attached gum extends uninterrupted from the facial
    to the lingual aspect. \n\nThe col may be important in the formation of periodontal
    disease but is visible clinically only when teeth are extracted.\n\nInterdental
    AreasIt is the part of gum which extends in between two teeth up to the contact
    point. \n\nThere is a facial side interdental papilla and a lingual side interdental
    papilla. \n\nInterdental papilla has a summit and margins that are concave. \n\nThe
    tip and the margins are unattached and the central portion attached. \n\nIn inflammations
    the interdental papilla loses its concavity.\n\n\n== Characteristics of healthy
    gums ==\n\n=== Color ===\n\nHealthy gums usually have a color that has been described
    as \"coral pink\". \n\nOther colours like red, white, and blue can signify inflammation
    (gingivitis) or pathology. \n\nSmoking or drug use can cause discoloring as well
    (such as \"meth mouth\"). \n\nAlthough described as the colour coral pink, variation
    in colour is possible. \n\nThis can be the result of factors such as: thickness
    and degree of keratinization of the epithelium, blood flow to the gums, natural
    pigmentation of the skin, disease, and medications.\n\nSince the colour of the
    gums can vary, uniformity of colour is more important than the underlying color
    itself. \n\nExcess deposits of melanin can cause dark spots or patches on the
    gums (melanin gingival hyperpigmentation), especially at the base of the interdental
    papillae. \n\nGum depigmentation (aka gum bleaching) is a procedure used in cosmetic
    dentistry to remove these discolorations.\n\n\n=== Contour ===\n\nHealthy gums
    have a smooth curved or scalloped appearance around each tooth. \n\nHealthy gums
    fill and fit each space between the teeth, unlike the swollen gum papilla seen
    in gingivitis or the empty interdental embrasure seen in periodontal disease.
    \n\nHealthy gums hold tight to each tooth in that the gum surface narrows to
    \"knife-edge\" thin at the free gingival margin. \n\nOn the other hand, inflamed
    gums have a \"puffy\" or \"rolled\" margin.\n\n\n=== Texture ===\n\nHealthy gums
    have a firm texture that is resistant to movement, and the surface texture often
    exhibits surface stippling. \n\nUnhealthy gums, on the other hand, is often swollen
    and less firm. \n\nHealthy gums have an orange-peel like texture to it due to
    the stippling.\n\n\n=== Reaction to disturbance ===\n\nHealthy gums usually have
    no reaction to normal disturbance such as brushing or periodontal probing. \n\nUnhealthy
    gums, conversely, will show bleeding on probing (BOP) and/or purulent exudate.\n\n\n==
    Clinical significance ==\n\nThe gingival cavity microecosystem, fueled by food
    residues and saliva, can support the growth of many microorganisms, of which
    some can be injurious to health. \n\nImproper or insufficient oral hygiene can
    thus lead to many gum and periodontal disorders, including gingivitis or periodontitis,
    which are major causes for tooth failure. \n\nRecent studies have also shown
    that anabolic steroids are also closely associated with gingival enlargement
    requiring a gingivectomy for many cases. \n\nGingival recession is when there
    is an apical movement of the gum margin away from the biting (occlusal) surface.
    \n\nIt may indicate an underlying inflammation such as periodontitis or pyorrhea,
    a pocket formation, dry mouth or displacement of the marginal gums away from
    the tooth by mechanical (such as brushing), chemical, or surgical means. \n\nGingival
    retraction, in turn, may expose the dental neck and leave it vulnerable to the
    action of external stimuli, and may cause root sensitivity.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gums"

  descriptionText: "\n\nNEUROHYPOPHYSIS/POSTERIOR PITUITARY\n\n\nThe posterior pituitary
    (or neurohypophysis) is the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland which is part
    of the endocrine system. \n\nThe posterior pituitary is not glandular as is the
    anterior pituitary. \n\nInstead, it is largely a collection of axonal projections
    from the hypothalamus that terminate behind the anterior pituitary, and serve
    as a site for the secretion of neurohypophysial hormones (oxytocin and vasopressin)
    directly into the blood. \n\nThe hypothalamic\u2013neurohypophyseal system is
    composed of the hypothalamus (the paraventricular nucleus and supraoptic nucleus),
    posterior pituitary, and these axonal projections.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe
    posterior pituitary consists mainly of neuronal projections (axons) of magnocellular
    neurosecretory cells extending from the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei
    of the hypothalamus. \n\nThese axons store and release neurohypophysial hormones
    oxytocin and vasopressin into the neurohypophyseal capillaries, from there they
    get into the systemic circulation (and partly back into the hypophyseal portal
    system). \n\nIn addition to axons, the posterior pituitary also contains pituicytes,
    specialized glial cells resembling astrocytes assisting in the storage and release
    of the hormones.\n\nClassification of the posterior pituitary varies, but most
    sources include the two regions below:\n\nPars nervosa\nAlso called the neural
    lobe or posterior lobe, this region constitutes the majority of the posterior
    pituitary and is the storage site of oxytocin and vasopressin. \n\nSometimes
    (incorrectly) considered synonymous with the posterior pituitary, the pars nervosa
    includes Herring bodies and pituicytes.\n\nInfundibular stalk\n\nAlso known as
    the infundibulum or pituitary stalk, the infundibular stalk bridges the hypothalamic
    and hypophyseal systems.\n\nThe median eminence is only occasionally included
    as part of the posterior pituitary. \n\nOther sources specifically exclude it
    from the pituitary.A few sources include the pars intermedia as part of the posterior
    lobe, but this is a minority view. \n\nIt is based upon the gross anatomical
    separation of the posterior and anterior pituitary along the cystic remnants
    of Rathke's pouch, causing the pars intermedia to remain attached to the neurohypophysis.\n\n\n==
    Function ==\n\n\n\n=== Hormone secretion ===\n\nTwo hormones are classically
    considered as being related to the posterior pituitary: oxytocin and vasopressin.
    \n\nThese hormones are created in the hypothalamus and released in the posterior
    pituitary. \n\nAfter creation, they are stored in neurosecretory vesicles regrouped
    into Herring bodies before being secreted in the posterior pituitary via the
    bloodstream.\n\n\n== Clinical significance ==\n\nInsufficient secretion of vasopressin
    underlies diabetes insipidus, a condition in which the body loses the capacity
    to concentrate urine. \n\nAffected individuals excrete as much as 20 liters of
    dilute urine per day. \n\nOversecretion of vasopressin causes the syndrome of
    inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH).\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_pituitary"

  descriptionText: "\n\nPAROTID GLAND\n\n\nThe parotid gland is a major salivary
    gland in many animals. \n\nIn humans, the two parotid glands are present on either
    side of the mouth and in front of both ears. \n\nThey are the largest of the
    salivary glands. \n\nEach parotid is wrapped around the mandibular ramus, and
    secretes serous saliva through the parotid duct into the mouth, to facilitate
    mastication and swallowing and to begin the digestion of starches. \n\nThere
    are also two other types of salivary glands; they are submandibular and sublingual
    glands. \n\nSometimes accessory parotid glands are found close to the main parotid
    glands.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe word parotid literally means \"beside the
    ear\". \n\nFrom Greek \u03C0\u03B1\u03C1\u03C9\u03C4\u03AF\u03C2 (stem \u03C0\u03B1\u03C1\u03C9\u03C4\u03B9\u03B4-)
    : (gland) behind the ear < \u03C0\u03B1\u03C1\u03AC - par\xE1 : in front, and
    \u03BF\u1F56\u03C2 - ous (stem \u1F60\u03C4-, \u014Dt-) : ear.\n\n\n== Structure
    ==\n\nThe parotid glands are a pair of mainly serous salivary glands located
    below and in front of each ear canal, draining their secretions into the vestibule
    of the mouth through the parotid duct. \n\nEach gland lies behind the mandibular
    ramus and in front of the mastoid process of the temporal bone. \n\nThe gland
    can be felt on either side, by feeling in front of each ear, along the cheek,
    and below the angle of the mandible.\n\nThe parotid duct, a long excretory duct,
    emerges from the front of each gland, superficial to the masseter muscle. \n\nThe
    duct pierces the buccinator muscle, then opens into the mouth on the inner surface
    of the cheek, usually opposite the maxillary second molar. \n\nThe parotid papilla
    is a small elevation of tissue that marks the opening of the parotid duct on
    the inner surface of the cheek.The gland has four surfaces \u2013 superficial
    or lateral, superior, anteromedial, and posteromedial. \n\nThe gland has three
    borders \u2013 anterior, medial, and posterior. \n\nThe parotid gland has two
    ends \u2013 superior end in the form of small superior surface and an inferior
    end (apex). \n\nA number of different structures pass through the gland. \n\nFrom
    lateral to medial, these are:\n\nFacial nerve\nRetromandibular vein\nExternal
    carotid artery\nSuperficial temporal artery\nBranches of the great auricular
    nerve\nMaxillary arterySometimes accessory parotid glands are found as an anatomic
    variation. \n\nThese are close to the main glands and consist of ectopic salivary
    gland tissue.\n\nCapsule of parotid gland\n\nCapsule of the parotid gland is
    formed from the investing layer of the deep cervical fascia. \n\nIt is supplied
    by great auricular nerve. \n\nThe fascia splits to enclose the gland. \n\nThis
    splitting occurs between the angle of the mandible and the mastoid process. \n\nThe
    superficial lamina (parotidomassetric fascia) is thick and is attached to zygomatic
    arch. \n\nThe deep lamina is thin and is attached to styloid process, tympanic
    plate and the ramus of the mandible. \n\nThe part of deep lamina extending between
    the styloid process and the mandible is thickened to form stylomastoid ligament.
    \n\nThe stylomandibular ligament separates parotid gland from the superficial
    lobe of the submandibular gland.\n\n\n=== Location ===\n\nSuperficial or lateral
    relations: \n    The gland is situated deep to the skin, superficial fascia,
    superficial lamina of investing layer of deep cervical fascia and great auricular
    nerve (anterior ramus of C2 and C3).\n\nAnteromedial relations: \n    The gland
    is situated posterolaterally to the mandibular ramus, masseter and medial pterygoid
    muscles. \n\nA part of the gland may extend between the ramus and medial pterygoid,
    as the pterygoid process. \n\nBranches of facial nerve and parotid duct emerge
    through this surface.\n\nPosteromedial relations: \n    The gland is situated
    anterolaterally to mastoid process of temporal bone with its attached sternocleidomastoid
    and digastric muscles, styloid process of temporal bone with its three attached
    muscles (stylohyoid, stylopharyngeus, and styloglossus) and carotid sheath with
    its contained neurovasculature (internal carotid artery, internal jugular vein,
    and 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th cranial nerves).\n\nMedial relations: \n    The
    parotid gland comes into contact with the superior pharyngeal constrictor muscle
    at the medial border, where the anteromedial and posteromedial surfaces meet.
    \n\nHence, a need exists to examine the fauces in parotitis.\n\n\n=== Blood supply
    ===\n\nThe external carotid artery and its terminal branches within the gland,
    namely, the superficial temporal and the maxillary artery, also the posterior
    auricular artery supply the parotid gland. \n\nVenous return is to the retromandibular
    veins.\n\n\n=== Lymphatic drainage ===\n\nThe gland is mainly drained into the
    preauricular or parotid lymph nodes which ultimately drain to the deep cervical
    chain.\n\n\n=== Nerve supply ===\n\nThe parotid gland receives both sensory and
    autonomic innervation. \n\nGeneral sensory innervation to the parotid gland,
    its sheath, and the overlying skin is provided by the auriculotemporal nerve.
    \n\nThe autonomic innervation controls the rate of saliva production and is supplied
    by the glossopharyngeal nerve.\n\nThe cell bodies of the preganglionic sympathetic
    fibres usually lie in the lateral horns of upper thoracic spinal segments (T1-T3).
    \n\nPostganglionic sympathetic fibers from superior cervical sympathetic ganglion
    reach the gland as periarterial nerve plexuses around the external carotid artery
    and their function is mainly vasoconstriction. \n\nPreganglionic parasympathetic
    fibers leave the brain stem from inferior salivatory nucleus in the glossopharyngeal
    nerve and then through its tympanic and then the lesser petrosal branch pass
    into the otic ganglion. \n\nThere, they synapse with postganglionic fibers which
    reach the gland by hitch-hiking via the auriculotemporal nerve, a branch of the
    mandibular nerve.:\u200A255\u200A\n\n\n=== Histology ===\n\n\nThe gland has a
    capsule of its own of dense connective tissue, but is also provided with a false
    capsule by the investing layer of the deep cervical fascia. \n\nThe fascia at
    the imaginary line between the angle of the mandible and the mastoid process
    splits into a superficial and a deep lamina to enclose the gland. \n\nThe risorius
    is a small muscle embedded with this capsule substance.\nThe gland has short,
    striated ducts and long, intercalated ducts. \n\nThe intercalated ducts are also
    numerous and lined with cuboidal epithelial cells, and have lumina larger than
    those of the acini. \n\nThe striated ducts are also numerous and consist of simple
    columnar epithelium, having striations that represent the infolded basal cell
    membranes and mitochondria.\n\nThough the parotid gland is the largest, it provides
    only 25% of the total salivary volume. \n\nThe serous cell predominates in the
    parotid, making the gland secrete a mainly serous secretory product.\n\nThe parotid
    gland also secretes salivary alpha-amylase (sAA), which is the first step in
    the decomposition of starches during mastication. \n\nIt is the main exocrine
    gland to secrete this. \n\nIt breaks down amylose (straight chain starch) and
    amylopectin (branched starch) by hydrolyzing alpha 1,4 bonds. \n\nAdditionally,
    the alpha amylase has been suggested to prevent bacterial attachment to oral
    surfaces and to enable bacterial clearance from the mouth.\n\n\n== Development
    ==\n\nThe parotid salivary glands appear early in the sixth week of the prenatal
    development and are the first major salivary glands formed. \n\nThe epithelial
    buds of these glands are located on the inner part of the cheek, near the labial
    commissures of the primitive mouth (from ectodermal lining near angles of the
    stomodeum in the 1st/2nd pharyngeal arches; the stomodeum itself is created from
    the rupturing of the oropharyngeal membrane at about 26 days.) \n\nThese buds
    grow posteriorly toward the otic placodes of the ears and branch to form solid
    cords with rounded terminal ends near the developing facial nerve. \n\nLater,
    at around 10 weeks of prenatal development, these cords are canalized and form
    ducts, with the largest becoming the parotid duct for the parotid gland. \n\nThe
    rounded terminal ends of the cords form the acini of the glands. \n\nSecretion
    by the parotid glands via the parotid duct begins at about 18 weeks of gestation.
    \n\nAgain, the supporting connective tissue of the gland develops from the surrounding
    mesenchyme.\n\n\n== Parotid gland swellings ==\n\n=== Causes ===\n\n==== Mumps
    ====\n\nMumps is seen to be a common cause of parotid gland swelling \u2013 85%
    of cases occur in children younger than 15 years. \n\nThe disease is highly contagious
    and spreads by airborne droplets from salivary, nasal, and urinary secretions.
    \n\nSymptoms include oedema in the area, trismus as well as otalgia. \n\nThe
    lesion tends to begin on one side of the face and eventually becomes bilateral.
    \n\nThe transmission of the paramyxovirus is by contact with the infected persons
    saliva. \n\nInitial symptoms tend to be a headache and fever. \n\nMumps is not
    fatal, however further complications can include swelling of the ovaries or the
    testes. \n\nDiagnosis of mumps is confirmed through viral serology, management
    of the condition includes hydration and good oral hygiene of the patient requiring
    excellent motivation. \n\nHowever, since the development of the mumps vaccine,
    given at the age of between 4\u20136 years, the incidence of this viral infection
    has greatly reduced. \n\nThis vaccine has reduced the incidence by 99%.\n\n\n====
    Neoplasms ====\n\n===== Benign =====\n\nNeoplastic lesions of the parotid salivary
    gland can either be benign or malignant. \n\nWithin the parotid gland, nearly
    80% of tumours are benign. \n\nBenign lesions tend to be painless, asymptomatic
    and slow-growing. \n\nThe most common salivary gland neoplasms in children are
    hemangiomas, lymphatic malformations, and pleomorphic adenomas. \n\nDiagnosis
    of benign lesions require a fine-needle-like aspiration biopsy. \n\nWith various
    benign lesions, most commonly the pleomorphic adenoma, there is a risk of developing
    malignancy over time. \n\nAs a result, these lesions are typically resected.\n\nPleomorphic
    adenoma is seen to be a common benign neoplasm of the salivary gland and has
    an overall incidence of 54\u201368%. \n\nThe Warthin tumour has a lower incidence
    of 6\u201310%; this tumour is associated with smoking and is more common in older
    men. \n\nBenign lesions of the parotid gland have a significantly higher incidence
    than malignant lesions.\n\n\n===== Malignant =====\n\nMalignant salivary gland
    lesions are rare. \n\nHowever, when a tumour extends to the submandibular, sublingual
    and the minor salivary glands, they tend to be malignant. \n\nDistinguishing
    a malignant lesion from a benign one may be difficult as they both present as
    painless lesions. \n\nA biopsy is crucial in aiding diagnosis. \n\nThere are
    common signs that can highlight the presence of a malignant lesion. \n\nThese
    include facial nerve weakness, rapid increase of the size of the lump as well
    as ulceration of the mucosa of the skin.\n\nMucoepidermoid carcinoma is a common
    malignant tumour of the salivary glands and has a low incidence of 4\u201313%.
    \n\nAdenoid cystic carcinoma is also a common malignant salivary gland lesion
    and has an incidence of 4\u20138%. \n\nThis carcinoma tends to invade nerves
    and can re-occur post-treatment.\n\n\n==== Polycystic Parotid Disease ====\n\nA
    developmental polycystic disease of the salivary gland is seen to be extremely
    rare and is seen to be independent of recurrent parotitis. \n\nThe cause is thought
    to be a defect in the interactions between activin, follistatin and TGF-\u03B2,
    leading to a developmental disorder of glandular tissue.\n\n\n== Clinical significance
    ==\n\n=== Parotitis ===\n\nInflammation of one or both parotid glands is known
    as parotitis. \n\nThe most common cause of parotitis is mumps. \n\nWidespread
    vaccination against mumps has markedly reduced the incidence of mumps parotitis.
    \n\nThe pain of mumps is due to the swelling of the gland within its fibrous
    capsule.\n\nApart from viral infection, other infections, such as bacterial,
    can cause parotitis (acute suppurative parotitis or chronic parotitis). \n\nThese
    infections may cause blockage of the duct by salivary duct calculi or external
    compression. \n\nParotid gland swellings can also be due to benign lymphoepithelial
    lesions caused by Mikulicz disease and Sj\xF6gren syndrome. \n\nSwelling of the
    parotid gland may also indicate the eating disorder bulimia nervosa, creating
    the look of a heavy jaw line. \n\nWith the inflammation of mumps or obstruction
    of the ducts, increased levels of the salivary alpha amylase secreted by the
    parotid gland can be detected in the blood stream.\n\n\n=== Fibrous reactions
    ===\n\nTuberculosis and syphilis can cause granuloma formation in the parotid
    glands.\n\n\n=== Salivary stones ===\n\nSalivary stones mainly occur within the
    main confluence of the ducts and within the main parotid duct. \n\nThe patient
    usually complains of intense pain when salivating and tends to avoid foods which
    produce this symptom. \n\nIn addition, the parotid gland may become enlarged
    upon trying to eat. \n\nThe pain can be reproduced in clinic by squirting lemon
    juice into the mouth. \n\nSurgery depends upon the site of the stone: if within
    the anterior aspect of the duct, a simple incision into the buccal mucosa with
    sphinterotomy may allow removal; however, if situated more posteriorly within
    the main duct, complete gland excision may be necessary.\n\n\n=== Injury ===\n\nThe
    parotid salivary gland can also be pierced and the facial nerve temporarily traumatized
    when an inferior alveolar local anesthesia nerve block is incorrectly administered,
    causing transient facial paralysis.\n\n\n=== Cancer and tumours ===\n\nAbout
    80% of tumors of the parotid gland are benign. \n\nThe most common of these include
    pleomorphic adenoma (70% of tumors, of which 60% occur in females) and Warthin
    tumor (i.e. adenolymphoma, which is more common in males than in females). \n\nTheir
    importance is in relation to their anatomical position and tendency to grow over
    time. \n\nThe tumorous growth can also change the consistency of the gland and
    cause facial pain on the involved side.\n\nAround 20% of parotid tumors are malignant,
    with the most common tumors being mucoepidermoid carcinoma and adenoid cystic
    carcinoma. \n\nOther malignant tumors of the parotid gland include acinic cell
    carcinoma, carcinoma expleomorphic adenoma, adenocarcinoma (arising from ductal
    epithelium of parotid gland), squamous cell carcinoma (arising from parenchyma
    of parotid gland), and undifferentiated carcinoma. \n\nMetastasis from other
    sites like phyllodes tumour of breast presenting as parotid swelling have also
    been described. \n\nCritically, the relationship of the tumor to the branches
    of the facial nerve (CN VII) must be defined because resection may damage the
    nerves, resulting in paralysis of the muscles of facial expression.\n\n\n===
    Surgery ===\n\nSurgical treatment of parotid gland tumors is sometimes difficult
    because of the anatomical relations of the facial nerve parotid lodge, as well
    as the increased potential for postoperative relapse. \n\nThus, detection of
    early stages of a parotid tumor is extremely important in terms of postoperative
    prognosis. \n\nOperative technique is laborious, because of relapses and incomplete
    previous treatment made in other border specialties. \n\nSurgical techniques
    in parotid surgery have evolved in the last years with the use of neuromonitoring
    of the facial nerve and have become safer and less invasive.\n\nAfter surgical
    removal of the parotid gland (Parotidectomy), the auriculotemporal nerve is liable
    to damage and upon recovery it fuses with sweat glands. \n\nThis can cause sweating
    on the cheek on the side of the face of the affected gland. \n\nThis condition
    is known as Frey's syndrome.\n\n\n== Infections ==\n\n=== Bacterial infections
    ===\n\n==== Acute bacterial parotitis ====\n\nCommonly caused by a retrograde
    bacterial infection as a result of illness, sepsis, trauma, surgery, reduced
    salivary flow due to medications, diabetes, malnutrition and dehydration. \n\nClassically
    symptoms of painful swelling in the parotid region when eating seen. \n\nManagement
    is based upon antibacterials, rehydration combined with gentle massage to encourage
    salivary flow.\n\n\n==== Chronic bacterial parotitis ====\n\nA latent infection
    despite clinical resolution of the disease resulting in impaired function. \n\nHistologically
    glandular duct dilation, abscess formation and atrophy may be seen. \n\nParotid
    secretions are viscous. \n\nDisease course shows pain and swelling, waxing and
    waning. \n\nRadiographic screening should be undertaken to rule out sialolith.
    \n\nManagement with palliative care with parotidectomy as a last resort.\n\n\n\n===
    Viral infections ===\n\n==== Mumps ====\n\nAcute non-suppurative disease that
    often occurs in epidemics. \n\nPrevented by MMR vaccine. \n\nCaused by paramyxovirus
    that is transmitted by infected saliva and urine. \n\nA prodromal period of 24\u201328
    hours is experienced, followed by rapid and painful swelling of the parotid gland.
    \n\nTreatment is supportive (bedrest, hydration) as spontaneous resolution occurs
    within 5\u201310 days.\n\n\n==== HIV / AIDS ====\n\nDiffuse gland enlargement
    is seen, and may affect patients throughout all stages of the infection. \n\nLymphoepithelial
    cysts seen via imaging help aid diagnosis. \n\nPathogenic process occurs due
    to circulating CD8 lymphocytes within the salivary gland. \n\nMedical management
    via use of antiretrovirals, excellent oral hygiene measures and sialogogues.\n\n\n===
    Autoimmune related ===\n\n==== Systemic lupus erythematosus ====\n\nMost commonly
    seen in fourth and fifth decades in women, and can affect any salivary gland.
    \n\nPresentation is a slowly enlarging gland, with diagnosis made by identification
    of the underlying systemic disorder and measurements of salivary chemical levels.
    \n\nSodium and chloride ion levels will be elevated two or three times normal
    levels. \n\nTreatment is by addressing the underlying systemic condition.\n\n\n====
    Sarcoidosis ====\n\nSarcoidosis is a chronic systemic disease characterised by
    the production of non-caseating granulomas of unknown aetiology. \n\nIt can affect
    any organ of the body, depressing cellular immunity and enhancing humoral immunity.\n\nSalivary
    gland involvement primarily involves the parotid gland, causing enlargement and
    swelling. \n\nSalivary gland biopsy with histopathologic examination is needed
    to make the distinction between whether Sjoren\u2019s syndrome or sarcoidosis
    is the cause of this.\n\n\n==== Sjogren's syndrome ====\n\nSalivary gland enlargement
    occurs in up to 30% of patients with Sjogren\u2019s syndrome, with the parotid
    gland being most often enlarged, and bilateral parotid gland enlargement seen
    in 25\u201360% of patients. \n\nHowever, the parotid glands have a longer-lasting
    secretory capacity in Sjogren\u2019s syndrome patient and therefore are the last
    glands to manifest hyposalivation in the disease. \n\nHistopathology shows clustering
    of lymphocytic infiltrates and epimyoepithelial islands.\n\n\n=== Mycobacterial
    infection ===\n\n\nThe most common head and neck manifestation of tuberculosis
    mycobacterial disease is infection of cervical lymph nodes. \n\nThe infection
    is thought to originate in the tonsils or gingiva, ascending to the parotid gland.
    \n\nTwo clinical forms; acute and chronic lesions. \n\nAcute lesions have diffuse
    glandular edema, easily confused with acute sialdentitis or abscess. \n\nThe
    chronic lesions occur as slow growing masses mimicking tumors.\n\n\n== Examination
    of the salivary gland ==\n\n\n\n=== History and examination ===\n\nA patient
    with parotid swelling may complain of swelling, pain, xerostomia, bad taste and
    sometimes sialorrhoea.\n\nThe most common presenting symptom of neoplasms (both
    benign and malignant) is an asymptomatic swelling. \n\nPain is more common in
    patients with parotid cancer (10\u201329% feel pain) than those with benign neoplasms
    (only 2.5\u20134%), but pain itself it not diagnostic of malignancy.\n\nEpisodic
    swelling of major salivary glands accompanied by pain and related to salivary
    stimuli suggests duct obstruction.\n\nAlso need to assess the facial nerve. \n\nThe
    facial nerve passes through the parotid so may be affected if there is a change
    in the parotid gland. \n\nFacial nerve paralysis in a previously untreated patient
    usually indicates that a tumour is malignant.\n\n\n=== Physical examination ===\n\nThe
    superficial location of the salivary glands allows palpation and visual inspection.
    \n\nThe inspection must be systematic, both intraorally and extraorally, so no
    area is missed.\n\nFor extraoral examination the patients head should be inclined
    forwards in order to maximally expose the parotid and submandibular glands. \n\nA
    normal parotid gland is barely palpable and a normal sublingual gland is not
    palpable.Intra-oral examination should include observations for asymmetry, discolouration,
    pulsation and obstructions in the duct orifices. \n\nSwelling of the deep lobe
    of the parotid gland may be seen intra-orally, and may also displace the tonsil.
    \n\nThe minor salivary glands should be examined. \n\nThe labial, buccal and
    posterior palatal mucosa should be dried with an air blower or tissue and pressed
    to assess the flow of saliva.\n\n\n=== Salivary testing ===\n\nSalivary stimulation\n\nThis
    can be done by palpating the parotid gland, thus stimulating it. \n\nAssess to
    see whether there is saliva flowing from the parotid papilla.Sialography\n\nSialograms
    can identify changes in salivary gland architecture and are useful in the evaluation
    of major gland swellings.\n\nIt involves the instillation of a radio-opaque fluid
    into the major gland ductal system. \n\nThis outlines the major and minor ductal
    systems, and also gives an outline of the glandular tissue.\n\nFor example, sialadenitis
    creates an appearance known as \u201Cpruning of the tree\u201D on a sialogram,
    where there are less branches visible from the duct system. \n\nAlso, a space
    occupying lesion that occurs within or adjacent to a salivary gland can displace
    the normal anatomy of the gland. \n\nThis may create an appearance known as \u201Cball
    in hand\u201D on a sialogram, where the ducts are curved around the mass of the
    lesion.Sialochemistry\n\nThe composition of saliva changes in disease states,
    and analysis of saliva for enzymes, electrolytes, hormones, drugs and immunisation
    status can be performed.Radioisotope scintigraphy \n\nGives an objective measure
    of isotope uptake and excretion using a gamma scintillation camera. \n\nAfter
    about 20 minutes, a salivary stimulant will be given to promote salivary flow
    through the gland. \n\nThey are used to assess patients with persistent symptoms
    of dry mouth and also to evaluate salivary gland swelling due to infection, inflammation
    or obstruction.\n\n\n=== Further tests ===\n\n-Imagining techniques\n\n-Ultrasounds,
    CT Scans or MRIs can aid with disease localisation\n\n-Sialoendoscopy\n\n-A camera
    is inserted into the duct of a salivary gland to assess blockages\n\n-Biopsy\n\n-This
    can be done by fine needle aspiration biopsy, which provides an opportunity to
    obtain information about the histology of a salivary tumour prior to initiation
    of treatment.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parotid_gland"

  descriptionText: "\n\nSOFT PALATE\n\n\nThe soft palate (also known as the velum,
    palatal velum, or muscular palate) is, in mammals, the soft tissue constituting
    the back of the roof of the mouth. \n\nThe soft palate is part of the palate
    of the mouth; the other part is the hard palate. \n\nThe soft palate is distinguished
    from the hard palate at the front of the mouth in that it does not contain bone.\n\n\n==
    Structure ==\n\n\n\n=== Muscles ===\n\n\nThe five muscles of the soft palate
    play important roles in swallowing and breathing. \n\nThe muscles are: \n\nTensor
    veli palatini, which is involved in swallowing\nPalatoglossus, involved in swallowing\nPalatopharyngeus,
    involved in breathing\nLevator veli palatini, involved in swallowing\nMusculus
    uvulae, which moves the uvulaThese muscles are innervated by the pharyngeal plexus
    via the vagus nerve, with the exception of the tensor veli palatini. \n\nThe
    tensor veli palatini is innervated by the mandibular division of the trigeminal
    nerve (V3).\n\n\n== Function ==\n\nThe soft palate is moveable, consisting of
    muscle fibers sheathed in mucous membrane. \n\nIt is responsible for closing
    off the nasal passages during the act of swallowing, and also for closing off
    the airway. \n\nDuring sneezing, it protects the nasal passage by diverting a
    portion of the excreted substance to the mouth.\nIn humans, the uvula hangs from
    the end of the soft palate. \n\nTouching the uvula or the end of the soft palate
    evokes a strong gag reflex in most people.\n\n\n=== Speech ===\n\nA speech sound
    made with the middle part of the tongue (dorsum) touching the soft palate is
    known as a velar consonant.\nIt is possible for the soft palate to retract and
    elevate during speech to separate the oral cavity (mouth) from the nasal cavity
    in order to produce the oral speech sounds. \n\nIf this separation is incomplete,
    air escapes through the nose, causing speech to be perceived as nasal.\n\n\n===
    Modelling ===\n\nWithin the microstructure of the soft palate lie a variety of
    variably-oriented fibers that create a nonuniform surface with a nonuniform density
    distribution. \n\nThe tissue has been characterized as viscoelastic, nonlinear,
    and anisotropic in the direction of the fibers. \n\nYoung modulus values range
    from 585 Pa at the posterior free edge of the soft palate to 1409 Pa where the
    soft palate attaches to the maxilla. \n\nThese properties are useful when quantifying
    the effects of corrective orthopedic devices such as the Hotz Plate on cleft
    lip.\nQuantitative analyses have been done on bilateral and unilateral cleft
    palate to better understand geometric differences in cleft palate throughout
    the course of its development and correction. \n\nDespite the difficulty in finding
    common, comparable landmarks between normal soft palates and cleft palates, analytical
    methods have been devised to assess differences in degree of curvature of the
    alveolar crest, two-dimensional and three-dimensional surface area, and slope
    of the alveolar crest.\nFinite element analysis has demonstrated effective modeling
    of soft-palate extension and movement. \n\nIt has also been an effective tool
    for evaluating the craniofacial effects of corrective orthopedic devices and
    cleft lip.\n\n\n== Clinical significance ==\n\n\n\n=== Disease ===\n\n\nPathology
    of the soft palate includes mucosal lesions such as pemphigus vulgaris dsg -
    3, herpangina and migratory stomatitis, and muscular conditions such as the congenital
    cleft palate and cleft uvula.\n\nPetechiae on the soft palate are mainly associated
    with streptococcal pharyngitis, and as such it is an uncommon but highly specific
    finding. 10 to 30 percent of palatal petechiae cases are estimated to be caused
    by suction, which can be habitual or secondary to fellatio.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_palate"

  descriptionText: "\n\nBRONCHUS\n\n\nA bronchus is a passage or airway in the lower
    respiratory tract that conducts air into the lungs. \n\nThe first or primary
    bronchi to branch from the trachea at the carina are the right main bronchus
    and the left main bronchus. \n\nThese are the widest bronchi, and enter the right
    lung, and the left lung at each hilum. \n\nThe main bronchi branch into narrower
    secondary bronchi or lobar bronchi, and these branch into narrower tertiary bronchi
    or segmental bronchi. \n\nFurther divisions of the segmental bronchi are known
    as 4th order, 5th order, and 6th order segmental bronchi, or grouped together
    as subsegmental bronchi.\n\nThe bronchi when too narrow to be supported by cartilage
    are known as bronchioles. \n\nNo gas exchange takes place in the bronchi.\n\n\n==
    Structure ==\n\nThe trachea (windpipe) divides at the carina into two main or
    primary bronchi, the left bronchus and the right bronchus. \n\nThe carina of
    the trachea is located at the level of the sternal angle and the fifth thoracic
    vertebra (at rest).\n\nThe right main bronchus is wider, shorter, and more vertical
    than the left main bronchus, its mean length is 1.09 cm. \n\nIt enters the root
    of the right lung at approximately the fifth thoracic vertebra. \n\nThe right
    main bronchus subdivides into three secondary bronchi (also known as lobar bronchi),
    which deliver oxygen to the three lobes of the right lung\u2014the superior,
    middle and inferior lobe. \n\nThe azygos vein arches over it from behind; and
    the right pulmonary artery lies at first below and then in front of it. \n\nAbout
    2 cm from its commencement it gives off a branch to the superior lobe of the
    right lung, which is also called the eparterial bronchus. \n\nEparterial refers
    to its position above the right pulmonary artery. \n\nThe right bronchus now
    passes below the artery, and is known as the hyparterial branch which divides
    into the two lobar bronchi to the middle and lower lobes.\n\nThe left main bronchus
    is smaller in caliber but longer than the right, being 5 cm long. \n\nIt enters
    the root of the left lung opposite the sixth thoracic vertebra. \n\nIt passes
    beneath the aortic arch, crosses in front of the esophagus, the thoracic duct,
    and the descending aorta, and has the left pulmonary artery lying at first above,
    and then in front of it. \n\nThe left bronchus has no eparterial branch, and
    therefore it has been supposed by some that there is no upper lobe to the left
    lung, but that the so-called upper lobe corresponds to the middle lobe of the
    right lung. \n\nThe left main bronchus divides into two secondary bronchi or
    lobar bronchi, to deliver air to the two lobes of the left lung\u2014the superior
    and the inferior lobe.\n\nThe secondary bronchi divide further into tertiary
    bronchi, (also known as segmental bronchi), each of which supplies a bronchopulmonary
    segment. \n\nA bronchopulmonary segment is a division of a lung separated from
    the rest of the lung by a septum of connective tissue. \n\nThis property allows
    a bronchopulmonary segment to be surgically removed without affecting other segments.
    \n\nInitially, there are ten segments in each lung, but during development with
    the left lung having just two lobes, two pairs of segments fuse to give eight,
    four for each lobe. \n\nThe tertiary bronchi divide further in another three
    branchings known as 4th order, 5th order and 6th order segmental bronchi which
    are also referred to as subsegmental bronchi. \n\nThese branch into many smaller
    bronchioles which divide into terminal bronchioles, each of which then gives
    rise to several respiratory bronchioles, which go on to divide into two to eleven
    alveolar ducts. \n\nThere are five or six alveolar sacs associated with each
    alveolar duct. \n\nThe alveolus is the basic anatomical unit of gas exchange
    in the lung.\nThe main bronchi have relatively large lumens that are lined by
    respiratory epithelium. \n\nThis cellular lining has cilia departing towards
    the mouth which removes dust and other small particles. \n\nThere is a smooth
    muscle layer below the epithelium arranged as two ribbons of muscle that spiral
    in opposite directions. \n\nThis smooth muscle layer contains seromucous glands,
    which secrete mucus, in its wall. \n\nHyaline cartilage is present in the bronchi,
    surrounding the smooth muscle layer. \n\nIn the main bronchi, the cartilage forms
    C-shaped rings like those in the trachea, while in the smaller bronchi, hyaline
    cartilage is present in irregularly arranged crescent-shaped plates and islands.
    \n\nThese plates give structural support to the bronchi and keep the airway open.The
    bronchial wall normally has a thickness of 10% to 20% of the total bronchial
    diameter.\n\n\n=== Microanatomy ===\n\n\nThe cartilage and mucous membrane of
    the main bronchus (primary bronchi) are similar to those in the trachea. \n\nThey
    are lined with respiratory epithelium, which is classified as ciliated pseudostratified
    columnar epithelium. \n\nThe epithelium in the main bronchi contains goblet cells,
    which are glandular, modified simple columnar epithelial cells that produce mucins,
    the main component of mucus. \n\nMucus plays an important role in keeping the
    airways clear in the mucociliary clearance process. \n\nAs branching continues
    through the bronchial tree, the amount of hyaline cartilage in the walls decreases
    until it is absent in the bronchioles. \n\nAs the cartilage decreases, the amount
    of smooth muscle increases. \n\nThe mucous membrane also undergoes a transition
    from ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium, to simple cuboidal epithelium,
    to simple squamous epithelium in the alveolar ducts and alveoli.\n\n\n=== Variation
    ===\n\nIn 0.1 to 5% of people there is a right superior lobe bronchus arising
    from the main stem bronchus prior to the carina. \n\nThis is known as a tracheal
    bronchus, and seen as an anatomical variation. \n\nIt can have multiple variations
    and, although usually asymptomatic, it can be the root cause of pulmonary disease
    such as a recurrent infection. \n\nIn such cases resection is often curative.\n\nThe
    cardiac bronchus has a prevalence of \u22480.3% and presents as an accessory
    bronchus arising from the bronchus intermedius between the upper lobar bronchus
    and the origin of the middle and lower lobar bronchi of the right main bronchus.\n\nAn
    accessory cardiac bronchus is usually an asymptomatic condition but may be associated
    with persistent infection or hemoptysis. \n\nIn about half of observed cases
    the cardiac bronchus presents as a short dead-ending bronchial stump, in the
    remainder the bronchus may exhibit branching and associated aerated lung parenchyma.\n\n\n==
    Function ==\n\n\nThe bronchi function to carry air that is breathed in through
    to the functional tissues of the lungs, called alveoli. \n\nExchange of gases
    between the air in the lungs and the blood in the capillaries occurs across the
    walls of the alveolar ducts and alveoli. \n\nThe alveolar ducts and alveoli consist
    primarily of simple squamous epithelium, which permits rapid diffusion of oxygen
    and carbon dioxide.\n\n\n== Clinical significance ==\n\n\nBronchial wall thickening,
    as can be seen on CT scan, generally (but not always) implies inflammation of
    the bronchi (bronchitis). \n\nNormally, the ratio of the bronchial wall thickness
    and the bronchial diameter is between 0.17 and 0.23.\n\n\n=== Bronchitis ===\n\n\nBronchitis
    is defined as inflammation of the bronchi, which can either be acute or chronic.
    \n\nAcute bronchitis is usually caused by viral or bacterial infections. \n\nMany
    sufferers of chronic bronchitis also suffer from chronic obstructive pulmonary
    disease (COPD), and this is usually associated with smoking or long-term exposure
    to irritants.\n\n\n=== Aspiration ===\n\nThe left main bronchus departs from
    the trachea at a greater angle than that of the right main bronchus. \n\nThe
    right bronchus is also wider than the left and these differences predispose the
    right lung to aspirational problems. \n\nIf food, liquids, or foreign bodies
    are aspirated, they will tend to lodge in the right main bronchus. \n\nBacterial
    pneumonia and aspiration pneumonia may result.\n\nIf a tracheal tube used for
    intubation is inserted too far, it will usually lodge in the right bronchus,
    allowing ventilation only of the right lung.\n\n\n=== Asthma ===\n\nAsthma is
    marked by hyperresponsiveness of the bronchi with an inflammatory component,
    often in response to allergens.\n\nIn asthma, the constriction of the bronchi
    can result in difficulty in breathing giving shortness of breath; this can lead
    to a lack of oxygen reaching the body for cellular processes. \n\nIn this case,
    an inhaler can be used to rectify the problem. \n\nThe inhaler administers a
    bronchodilator, which serves to soothe the constricted bronchi and to re-expand
    the airways. \n\nThis effect occurs quite quickly.\n\n\n=== Bronchial atresia
    ===\n\nBronchial atresia is a rare congenital disorder that can have a varied
    appearance. \n\nA bronchial atresia is a defect in the development of the bronchi,
    affecting one or more bronchi \u2013 usually segmental bronchi and sometimes
    lobar. \n\nThe defect takes the form of a blind-ended bronchus. \n\nThe surrounding
    tissue secretes mucus normally but builds up and becomes distended. \n\nThis
    can lead to regional emphysema.\n\nThe collected mucus may form a mucoid impaction
    or a bronchocele, or both. \n\nA pectus excavatum may accompany a bronchial atresia.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchus"

    (right superior lobar bronchus) is a branch of the right main bronchus given
    off about 2.5 cm from the bifurcation of the trachea.\n\nThis branch supplies
    the superior lobe of the right lung and is the most superior of all secondary
    bronchi. \n\nIt arises above the level of the right pulmonary artery, and for
    this reason is named the eparterial bronchus.\n\nAll other distributions falling
    below the pulmonary artery are termed hyparterial.\n\nThe eparterial bronchus
    is the only secondary bronchus with a specific name apart from the name of its
    corresponding lobe. \n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eparterial_bronchus"

  descriptionText: "\n\nTAENIA COLI\n\n\nThe taeniae coli (also teniae coli or tenia
    coli) are three separate longitudinal ribbons (taeniae meaning ribbon in Latin)
    of smooth muscle on the outside of the ascending, transverse, descending and
    sigmoid colons. \n\nThey are visible and can be seen just below the serosa or
    fibrosa. \n\nThere are three teniae coli: mesocolic, free and omental taeniae
    coli. \n\nThe teniae coli contract lengthwise to produce the haustra, the bulges
    in the colon.\nThe bands converge at the root of the vermiform appendix. \n\nAt
    the rectosigmoid junction, the taeniae spread out and unite to form the longitudinal
    muscle layer. \n\nIn the caecum, the ascending colon, the descending colon and
    sigmoid colon the positions of these bands are fixed. \n\nThe taenia libera,
    is placed anteriorly in the caecum, ascending, descending and sigmoid colon,
    but is placed inferiorly in the transverse colon. \n\nThe taenia mesocolica is
    present on the posteromedial surface of caecum, ascending, descending and sigmoid
    colon, but is placed posteriorly on transverse colon at the site of attachment
    of transverse mesocolon. \n\nThe taenia omentalis is situated posterolaterally
    in caecum, ascending, descending and sigmoid colon, but is situated on the anterosuperior
    surface of transverse colon where layers three and four of the greater omentum
    meet the transverse colon. \n\nThis change in position is due to the twist in
    transverse colon. \n\nThese bands correspond to the outer layer of the muscularis
    externa, in other portions of the digestive tract.\n\nThe teniae coli are regulated
    by the sacral nerves of the spinal cord, which are under control of the parasympathetic
    nervous system.\n\n\n== Diverticulosis ==\n\n\nSpaces between the circular bands
    of taeniae are weak points in the bowel, and are the sites of diverticulosis.
    \n\nMost diverticulosis occur in the sigmoid colon as it is the segment with
    the highest intraluminal pressure. \n\nDiverticulosis does not occur in the rectum
    as the tenia coli become a continuous muscular layer. \n\nDiverticulosis can
    then become diverticulitis if the patient develops inflammation of the diverticulosis,
    this whole spectrum of disease is called diverticular disease.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taenia_coli"

  descriptionText: "\n\nTAENIA COLI\n\n\nThe taeniae coli (also teniae coli or tenia
    coli) are three separate longitudinal ribbons (taeniae meaning ribbon in Latin)
    of smooth muscle on the outside of the ascending, transverse, descending and
    sigmoid colons. \n\nThey are visible and can be seen just below the serosa or
    fibrosa. \n\nThere are three teniae coli: mesocolic, free and omental taeniae
    coli. \n\nThe teniae coli contract lengthwise to produce the haustra, the bulges
    in the colon.\nThe bands converge at the root of the vermiform appendix. \n\nAt
    the rectosigmoid junction, the taeniae spread out and unite to form the longitudinal
    muscle layer. \n\nIn the caecum, the ascending colon, the descending colon and
    sigmoid colon the positions of these bands are fixed. \n\nThe taenia libera,
    is placed anteriorly in the caecum, ascending, descending and sigmoid colon,
    but is placed inferiorly in the transverse colon. \n\nThe taenia mesocolica is
    present on the posteromedial surface of caecum, ascending, descending and sigmoid
    colon, but is placed posteriorly on transverse colon at the site of attachment
    of transverse mesocolon. \n\nThe taenia omentalis is situated posterolaterally
    in caecum, ascending, descending and sigmoid colon, but is situated on the anterosuperior
    surface of transverse colon where layers three and four of the greater omentum
    meet the transverse colon. \n\nThis change in position is due to the twist in
    transverse colon. \n\nThese bands correspond to the outer layer of the muscularis
    externa, in other portions of the digestive tract.\n\nThe teniae coli are regulated
    by the sacral nerves of the spinal cord, which are under control of the parasympathetic
    nervous system.\n\n\n== Diverticulosis ==\n\n\nSpaces between the circular bands
    of taeniae are weak points in the bowel, and are the sites of diverticulosis.
    \n\nMost diverticulosis occur in the sigmoid colon as it is the segment with
    the highest intraluminal pressure. \n\nDiverticulosis does not occur in the rectum
    as the tenia coli become a continuous muscular layer. \n\nDiverticulosis can
    then become diverticulitis if the patient develops inflammation of the diverticulosis,
    this whole spectrum of disease is called diverticular disease.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taenia_coli"

  descriptionText: "\n\nSUBMANDIBULAR DUCT\n\n\nThe submandibular duct or Wharton
    duct or submaxillary duct, is one of the salivary excretory ducts. \n\nIt is
    about 5 cm. long, and its wall is much thinner than that of the parotid duct.
    \n\nIt drains saliva from each bilateral submandibular gland and sublingual gland
    to the sublingual caruncle at the base of the tongue.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\n\nThe
    submandibular duct arises from deep part of submandibular gland, a salivary gland.
    \n\nIt begins by numerous branches from the superficial surface of the gland,
    and runs forward between the mylohyoid, hyoglossus, and genioglossus muscles.
    \n\nIt then passes between the sublingual gland and the genioglossus and opens
    by a narrow opening on the summit of a small papilla (the \"sublingual caruncle\")
    at the side of the frenulum of the tongue. \n\nIt lies superior to lingual and
    hypoglossal nerves.\n\n\n=== Variation ===\n\nThe submandibular duct may be duplicated
    on one side or both sides, creating an accessory submandibular duct. \n\nRarely,
    it may not perforate into the mouth.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\nThe submandibular
    ducts drain saliva from the submandibular gland, and the sublingual glands to
    the sublingual caruncles at the base of the tongue.\n\n\n== Clinical significance
    ==\n\n\n=== Sialolithiasis ===\n\nThe submandibular duct may be affected by stones,
    known as sialolithiasis. \n\nThese may grow large, requiring surgery to remove.
    \n\nSimple palpation may be used to identify the location of any stones before
    surgery.\n\n\n=== Imperforate ===\n\nRarely, the submandibular duct may not perforate
    into the mouth. \n\nSurgery may be used to repair this birth defect.\n\n\n===
    Drooling ===\n\nThe exit of the submandibular gland into the mouth may be realigned
    in patients who drool. \n\nThis redirects the exiting saliva away from the vestibule
    and the lips. \n\nThis surgery has a fairly high success rate. \n\nRarely, the
    submandibular gland may need to be removed on one or both sides.\n\n\n== History

  descriptionText: "\n\nSEMINAL GLANDS/SEMINAL VESICLES\n\n\nThe seminal vesicles
    (also called vesicular glands, or seminal glands) are a pair of two convoluted
    tubular glands that lie behind the urinary bladder of some male mammals. \n\nThey
    secrete fluid that partly composes the semen.\n\nThe vesicles are 5\u201310 cm
    in size, 3\u20135 cm in diameter, and are located between the bladder and the
    rectum. \n\nThey have multiple outpouchings which contain secretory glands, which
    join together with the vas deferens as the ejaculatory duct. \n\nThey receive
    blood from the vesiculodeferential artery, and drain into the vesiculodeferential
    veins. \n\nThe glands are lined with column-shaped and cuboidal cells. \n\nThe
    vesicles are present in many groups of mammals, but not marsupials, monotremes
    or carnivores.\n\nInflammation of the seminal vesicles is called seminal vesiculitis,
    most often is due to bacterial infection as a result of a sexually transmitted
    disease or following a surgical procedure. \n\nSeminal vesiculitis can cause
    pain in the lower abdomen, scrotum, penis or peritoneum, painful ejaculation,
    and blood in the semen. \n\nIt is usually treated with antibiotics, although
    may require surgical drainage in complicated cases. \n\nOther conditions may
    affect the vesicles, including congenital abnormalities such as failure or incomplete
    formation, and, uncommonly, tumours.\n\nThe seminal vesicles have been described
    as early as the second century AD by Galen, although the vesicles only received
    their name much later, as they were initially described using the term from which
    the word prostate is derived.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe seminal vesicles are
    a pair of glands in males that are positioned below the urinary bladder and at
    the end of the vasa deferentia, where they enter the prostate. \n\nEach vesicle
    is a coiled and folded tube, with occasional outpouchings termed diverticula
    in its wall. \n\nThe lower part of the tube ends as a straight tube called the
    excretory duct which joins with the vas deferens of that side of the body to
    form an ejaculatory duct. \n\nThe ejaculatory ducts pass through the prostate
    gland before opening separately into the verumontanum of the prostatic urethra.
    \n\nThe vesicles are between 5\u201310 cm in size, 3\u20135 cm in diameter, and
    have a volume of around 13 mL.The vesicles receive blood supply from the vesiculodeferential
    artery, and also from the inferior vesical artery. \n\nThe vesiculodeferential
    artery arises from the umbilical arteries, which branch directly from the internal
    iliac arteries. \n\nBlood is drained into the vesiculodeferential veins and the
    inferior vesical plexus, which drain into the internal iliac veins. \n\nLymphatic
    drainage occurs along the venous routes, draining into the internal iliac nodes.The
    vesicles lie behind the bladder at the end of the vasa deferentia. \n\nThey lie
    in the space between the bladder and the rectum; the bladder and prostate lie
    in front, the tip of the ureter as it enters the bladder above, and Denonvilliers
    fascia and the rectum behind.\n\n\n=== Development ===\n\n\nIn the developing
    embryo, at the hind end lies a cloaca. \n\nThis, over the fourth to the seventh
    week, divides into a urogenital sinus and the beginnings of the anal canal, with
    a wall forming between these two inpouchings called the urorectal septum. \n\nTwo
    ducts form next to each other that connect to the urogenital sinus; the mesonephric
    duct and the paramesonephric duct, which go on to form the reproductive tracts
    of the male and female respectively.In the male, under the influence of testosterone,
    the mesonephric duct proliferates, forming the epididymis, ductus deferens and,
    via a small outpouching near the developing prostate, the seminal vesicles. \n\nSertoli
    cells secrete anti-mullerian hormone, which causes the paramesonephric duct to
    regress.\n\nThe development and maintenance of the seminal vesicles, as well
    as their secretion and size/weight, are highly dependent on androgens. \n\nThe
    seminal vesicles contain 5\u03B1-reductase, which metabolizes testosterone into
    its much more potent metabolite, dihydrotestosterone (DHT). \n\nThe seminal vesicles
    have also been found to contain luteinizing hormone receptors, and hence may
    also be regulated by the ligand of this receptor, luteinizing hormone.\n\n\n===
    Microanatomy ===\n\nThe inner lining of the seminal vesicles (the epithelium)
    is made of a lining of interspersed column-shaped and cube-shaped cells. \n\nThere
    are varying descriptions of the lining as being pseudostratified and consisting
    of column-shaped cells only. \n\nWhen viewed under a microscope, the cells are
    seen to have large bubbles in their interior. \n\nThis is because their interior,
    called cytoplasm, contains lipid droplets involved in secretion during ejaculation.
    \n\nThe tissue of the seminal vesicles is full of glands, spaced irregularly.
    \n\nAs well as glands, the seminal vesicles contain smooth muscle and connective
    tissue. \n\nThis fibrous and muscular tissue surrounds the glands, helping to
    expel their contents. \n\nThe outer surface of the glands is covered in peritoneum.\n\n\t\t\n==
    Function ==\n\nThe seminal vesicles secrete a significant proportion of the fluid
    that ultimately becomes semen. \n\nFluid is secreted from the ejaculatory ducts
    of the vesicles into the vas deferens, where it becomes part of semen. \n\nThis
    then passes through the urethra, where it is ejaculated during a male sexual
    response.About 70-85% of the seminal fluid in humans originates from the seminal
    vesicles. \n\nThe fluid consists of nutrients including fructose and citric acid,
    prostaglandins, and fibrinogen. \n\nNutrients help support sperm until fertilisation
    occurs; prostaglandins may also assist by softening mucous of the cervix, and
    by causing reverse contractions of parts of the female reproductive tract such
    as the fallopian tubes, to ensure that sperm are less likely to be expelled.\n\n\n==
    Clinical significance ==\n\n\n\n=== Disease ===\n\nSeminal vesiculitis (also
    known as spermatocystitis) is an inflammation of the seminal vesicles, most often
    caused by bacterial infection. \n\nSymptoms can include vague back or lower abdominal
    pain; pain of the penis, scrotum or peritoneum; painful ejaculation; blood in
    the semen on ejaculation; irritative and obstructive voiding symptoms; and impotence.
    \n\nInfection may be due to sexually transmitted infections, as a complication
    of a procedure such as prostate biopsy. \n\nIt is usually treated with antibiotics.
    \n\nIf a person experiences ongoing discomfort, transurethral seminal vesiculoscopy
    may be considered. \n\nIntervention in the form of drainage through the skin
    or surgery may also be required if the infection becomes an abscess. \n\nThe
    seminal vesicles may also be affected by tuberculosis, schistosomiasis and hydatid
    disease. \n\nThese diseases are investigated, diagnosed and treated according
    to the underlying disease.\n\nCongenital anomalies associated with the seminal
    vesicles include failure to develop, either completely (agenesis) or partially
    (hypoplasia), and cysts. \n\nFailure of the vesicles to form is often associated
    with absent vas deferens, or an abnormal connection between the vas deferens
    and the ureter. \n\nThe seminal vesicles may also be affected by cysts, amyloidosis,
    and stones. \n\nStones or cysts that become infected, or obstruct the vas deferens
    or seminal vesicles, may require surgical intervention.\n\nBenign tumours of
    the seminal vesicles are rare. \n\nWhen they do occur, they are usually papillary
    adenomas and cystadenomas. \n\nThey do not cause elevation of tumour markers,
    and are usually diagnosed based examination of tissue that has been removed after
    surgery. \n\nPrimary adenocarcinoma of the seminal vesicles, although rare, constitutes
    the most common malignant cancer of the seminal vesicles; that said, the majority
    of malignant cancers affecting the vesicles are lesions that have extended into
    the vesicles from nearby parts of the body. \n\nWhen adenocarcinoma occurs, it
    can cause blood in the urine, blood in the semen, painful urination, urinary
    retention, or even urinary obstruction. \n\nAdenocarcinomata are usually diagnosed
    after they are excised, based on tissue diagnosis. \n\nSome produce the tumour
    marker Ca-125, which can be used to monitor for reoccurence afterwards. \n\nEven
    rarer neoplasms include sarcoma, squamous cell carcinoma, yolk sac tumor, neuroendocrine
    carcinoma, paraganglioma, epithelial stromal tumors and lymphoma.\n\n\n=== Investigations
    ===\n\nSymptoms due to diseases of the seminal vesicles may be vague and not
    able to be specifically attributable to the vesicles themselves; additionally,
    some conditions such as tumours or cysts may not cause any symptoms at all. \n\nWhen
    diseases is suspected, such as due to pain on ejaculation, blood in the urine,
    infertility, due to urinary tract obstruction, further investigations may be
    conducted.\n\nA digital rectal examination, which involves a finger inserted
    by a medical practitioner through the anus, may cause greater than usual tenderness
    of the prostate gland, or may reveal a large seminal vesicle. \n\nA urine specimen
    may be collected, and is likely to demonstrate blood within the urine. \n\nLaboratory
    examination of seminal vesicle fluid requires a semen sample, e.g. for semen
    culture or semen analysis. \n\nFructose levels provide a measure of seminal vesicle
    function and, if absent, bilateral agenesis or obstruction is suspected.\n\nImaging
    of the vesicles is provided by medical imaging; either by transrectal ultrasound,
    CT or MRI scans. \n\nAn examination using cystoscopy, where a flexible tube is
    inserted in the urethra, may show disease of the vesicles because of changes
    in the normal appearance of the nearby bladder trigone, or prostatic urethra.\n\n\n==
    Other animals ==\n\nThe evolution of seminal vesicles may have been influenced
    by sexual selection. \n\nThey occur in many groups of mammals, but are absent
    in marsupials, monotremes, and carnivores. \n\nThe function is similar in all
    mammals they are present in, which is to secrete a fluid as part of semen that
    is ejaculated during the sexual response.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe action of
    the seminal vesicles has been described as early the second century AD by Galen,
    as \"glandular bodies\" that secrete substances alongside semen during reproduction.
    \n\nBy the time of Herophilus the presence of the glands and associated ducts
    had been described. \n\nAround the time of the early 17th century the word used
    to describe the vesicles, parastatai, eventually and unambiguously was used to
    refer to the prostate gland, rather than the vesicles. \n\nThe first time the
    prostate was portrayed in an individual drawing was by Reiner De Graaf in 1678.\n\nThe
    first described use of laparoscopic surgery on the vesicles was described in
    1993; this is now the preferred approach because of decreased pain, complications,
    and a shorter hospital stay.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seminal_vesicles"

  descriptionText: "\n\nSUPRARENAL GLAND/ADRENAL GLAND\n\n\nThe suprarenal glands
    (also known as adrenal glands) are endocrine glands that produce a variety of
    hormones including suprarenaline and the steroids aldosterone and cortisol. \n\nThey
    are found above the kidneys. \n\nEach gland has an outer cortex which produces
    steroid hormones and an inner medulla. \n\nThe suprarenal cortex itself is divided
    into three main zones: the zona glomerulosa, the zona fasciculata and the zona
    reticularis.\n\nThe suprarenal cortex produces three main types of steroid hormones:
    mineralocorticoids, glucocorticoids, and androgens. \n\nMineralocorticoids (such
    as aldosterone) produced in the zona glomerulosa help in the regulation of blood
    pressure and electrolyte balance. \n\nThe glucocorticoids cortisol and cortisone
    are synthesized in the zona fasciculata; their functions include the regulation
    of metabolism and immune system suppression. \n\nThe innermost layer of the cortex,
    the zona reticularis, produces androgens that are converted to fully functional
    sex hormones in the gonads and other target organs. \n\nThe production of steroid
    hormones is called steroidogenesis, and involves a number of reactions and processes
    that take place in cortical cells. \n\nThe medulla produces the catecholamines,
    which function to produce a rapid response throughout the body in stress situations.\n\nA
    number of endocrine diseases involve dysfunctions of the suprarenal gland. \n\nOverproduction
    of cortisol leads to Cushing's syndrome, whereas insufficient production is associated
    with Addison's disease. \n\nCongenital suprarenal hyperplasia is a genetic disease
    produced by dysregulation of endocrine control mechanisms. \n\nA variety of tumors
    can arise from suprarenal tissue and are commonly found in medical imaging when
    searching for other diseases.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\n\nThe suprarenal glands
    are located on both sides of the body in the retroperitoneum, above and slightly
    medial to the kidneys. \n\nIn humans, the right suprarenal gland is pyramidal
    in shape, whereas the left is semilunar or crescent shaped and somewhat larger.
    \n\nThe suprarenal glands measure approximately 3 cm in width, 5.0 cm in length,
    and up to 1.0 cm in thickness. \n\nTheir combined weight in an adult human ranges
    from 7 to 10 grams. \n\nThe glands are yellowish in colour.\n\nThe suprarenal
    glands are surrounded by a fatty capsule and lie within the renal fascia, which
    also surrounds the kidneys. \n\nA weak septum (wall) of connective tissue separates
    the glands from the kidneys. \n\nThe suprarenal glands are directly below the
    diaphragm, and are attached to the crura of the diaphragm by the renal fascia.\n\nEach
    suprarenal gland has two distinct parts, each with a unique function, the outer
    suprarenal cortex and the inner medulla, both of which produce hormones.\n\n\n===
    suprarenal cortex ===\n\n\nThe suprarenal cortex is the outer region and also
    the largest part of an suprarenal gland. \n\nIt is divided into three separate
    zones: zona glomerulosa, zona fasciculata and zona reticularis. \n\nEach zone
    is responsible for producing specific hormones.\nThe suprarenal cortex is the
    outermost layer of the suprarenal gland. \n\nWithin the cortex are three layers,
    called \"zones\". \n\nWhen viewed under a microscope each layer has a distinct
    appearance, and each has a different function. \n\nThe suprarenal cortex is devoted
    to production of hormones, namely aldosterone, cortisol, and androgens.\n\n\n====
    Zona glomerulosa ====\nThe outermost zone of the suprarenal cortex is the zona
    glomerulosa. \n\nIt lies immediately under the fibrous capsule of the gland.
    \n\nCells in this layer form oval groups, separated by thin strands of connective
    tissue from the fibrous capsule of the gland and carry wide capillaries.\n\nThis
    layer is the main site for production of aldosterone, a mineralocorticoid, by
    the action of the enzyme aldosterone synthase. \n\nAldosterone plays an important
    role in the long-term regulation of blood pressure.\n\n\n==== Zona fasciculata
    ====\nThe zona fasciculata is situated between the zona glomerulosa and zona
    reticularis. \n\nCells in this layer are responsible for producing glucocorticoids
    such as cortisol. \n\nIt is the largest of the three layers, accounting for nearly
    80% of the volume of the cortex. \n\nIn the zona fasciculata, cells are arranged
    in columns radially oriented towards the medulla. \n\nCells contain numerous
    lipid droplets, abundant mitochondria and a complex smooth endoplasmic reticulum.\n\n\n====
    Zona reticularis ====\nThe innermost cortical layer, the zona reticularis, lies
    directly adjacent to the medulla. \n\nIt produces androgens, mainly dehydroepiandrosterone
    (DHEA), DHEA sulfate (DHEA-S), and androstenedione (the precursor to testosterone)
    in humans. \n\nIts small cells form irregular cords and clusters, separated by
    capillaries and connective tissue. \n\nThe cells contain relatively small quantities
    of cytoplasm and lipid droplets, and sometimes display brown lipofuscin pigment.\n\n\n===
    Medulla ===\n\n\nThe suprarenal medulla is at the centre of each suprarenal gland,
    and is surrounded by the suprarenal cortex. \n\nThe chromaffin cells of the medulla
    are the body's main source of the catecholamines, such as suprarenaline and norsuprarenaline,
    released by the medulla. \n\nApproximately 20% norsuprarenaline (norepinephrine)
    and 80% suprarenaline (epinephrine) are secreted here.\n\nThe suprarenal medulla
    is driven by the sympathetic nervous system via preganglionic fibers originating
    in the thoracic spinal cord, from vertebrae T5\u2013T11. \n\nBecause it is innervated
    by preganglionic nerve fibers, the suprarenal medulla can be considered as a
    specialized sympathetic ganglion. \n\nUnlike other sympathetic ganglia, however,
    the suprarenal medulla lacks distinct synapses and releases its secretions directly
    into the blood.\n\n\n=== Blood supply ===\n\nThe suprarenal glands have one of
    the greatest blood supply rates per gram of tissue of any organ: up to 60 small
    arteries may enter each gland. \n\nThree arteries usually supply each suprarenal
    gland:\nThe superior suprarenal artery, a branch of the inferior phrenic artery\n-The
    middle suprarenal artery, a direct branch of the abdominal aorta\n-The inferior
    suprarenal artery, a branch of the renal arteryThese blood vessels supply a network
    of small arteries within the capsule of the suprarenal glands. \n\nThin strands
    of the capsule enter the glands, carrying blood to them.\n\nVenous blood is drained
    from the glands by the suprarenal veins, usually one for each gland:\n-The right
    suprarenal vein drains into the inferior vena cava\n-The left suprarenal vein
    drains into the left renal vein or the left inferior phrenic vein.The central
    adrenomedullary vein, in the suprarenal medulla, is an unusual type of blood
    vessel. \n\nIts structure is different from the other veins in that the smooth
    muscle in its tunica media (the middle layer of the vessel) is arranged in conspicuous,
    longitudinally oriented bundles.\n\n\n=== Variability ===\n\nThe suprarenal glands
    may not develop at all, or may be fused in the midline behind the aorta. \n\nThese
    are associated with other congenital abnormalities, such as failure of the kidneys
    to develop, or fused kidneys. \n\nThe gland may develop with a partial or complete
    absence of the cortex, or may develop in an unusual location.\n\n\n== Function
    ==\n\n\nThe suprarenal gland secretes a number of different hormones which are
    metabolised by enzymes either within the gland or in other parts of the body.
    \n\nThese hormones are involved in a number of essential biological functions.\n\n\n===
    Corticosteroids ===\n\nCorticosteroids are a group of steroid hormones produced
    from the cortex of the suprarenal gland, from which they are named.\nMineralocorticoids
    such as aldosterone regulate salt (\"mineral\") balance and blood volume.\n\nGlucocorticoids
    such as cortisol influence metabolism rates of proteins, fats and sugars (\"glucose\").\n\nAndrogens
    such as dehydroepiandrosterone.MineralocorticoidsThe suprarenal gland produces
    aldosterone, a mineralocorticoid, which is important in the regulation of salt
    (\"mineral\") balance and blood volume. \n\nIn the kidneys, aldosterone acts
    on the distal convoluted tubules and the collecting ducts by increasing the reabsorption
    of sodium and the excretion of both potassium and hydrogen ions. \n\nAldosterone
    is responsible for the reabsorption of about 2% of filtered glomerular filtrate.
    \n\nSodium retention is also a response of the distal colon and sweat glands
    to aldosterone receptor stimulation. \n\nAngiotensin II and extracellular potassium
    are the two main regulators of aldosterone production. \n\nThe amount of sodium
    present in the body affects the extracellular volume, which in turn influences
    blood pressure. \n\nTherefore, the effects of aldosterone in sodium retention
    are important for the regulation of blood pressure.\n\nGlucocorticoidsCortisol
    is the main glucocorticoid in humans. \n\nIn species that do not create cortisol,
    this role is played by corticosterone instead. \n\nGlucocorticoids have many
    effects on metabolism. \n\nAs their name suggests, they increase the circulating
    level of glucose. \n\nThis is the result of an increase in the mobilization of
    amino acids from protein and the stimulation of synthesis of glucose from these
    amino acids in the liver. \n\nIn addition, they increase the levels of free fatty
    acids, which cells can use as an alternative to glucose to obtain energy. \n\nGlucocorticoids
    also have effects unrelated to the regulation of blood sugar levels, including
    the suppression of the immune system and a potent anti-inflammatory effect. \n\nCortisol
    reduces the capacity of osteoblasts to produce new bone tissue and decreases
    the absorption of calcium in the gastrointestinal tract.The suprarenal gland
    secretes a basal level of cortisol but can also produce bursts of the hormone
    in response to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) from the anterior pituitary.
    \n\nCortisol is not evenly released during the day \u2013 its concentrations
    in the blood are highest in the early morning and lowest in the evening as a
    result of the circadian rhythm of ACTH secretion. \n\nCortisone is an inactive
    product of the action of the enzyme 11\u03B2-HSD on cortisol. \n\nThe reaction
    catalyzed by 11\u03B2-HSD is reversible, which means that it can turn administered
    cortisone into cortisol, the biologically active hormone.\n\nFormation\n\nAll
    corticosteroid hormones share cholesterol as a common precursor. \n\nTherefore,
    the first step in steroidogenesis is cholesterol uptake or synthesis. \n\nCells
    that produce steroid hormones can acquire cholesterol through two paths. \n\nThe
    main source is through dietary cholesterol transported via the blood as cholesterol
    esters within low density lipoproteins (LDL). \n\nLDL enters the cells through
    receptor-mediated endocytosis. \n\nThe other source of cholesterol is synthesis
    in the cell's endoplasmic reticulum. \n\nSynthesis can compensate when LDL levels
    are abnormally low. \n\nIn the lysosome, cholesterol esters are converted to
    free cholesterol, which is then used for steroidogenesis or stored in the cell.\n\nThe
    initial part of conversion of cholesterol into steroid hormones involves a number
    of enzymes of the cytochrome P450 family that are located in the inner membrane
    of mitochondria. \n\nTransport of cholesterol from the outer to the inner membrane
    is facilitated by steroidogenic acute regulatory protein and is the rate-limiting
    step of steroid synthesis.\n\nThe layers of the suprarenal gland differ by function,
    with each layer having distinct enzymes that produce different hormones from
    a common precursor. \n\nThe first enzymatic step in the production of all steroid
    hormones is cleavage of the cholesterol side chain, a reaction that forms pregnenolone
    as a product and is catalyzed by the enzyme P450scc, also known as cholesterol
    desmolase. \n\nAfter the production of pregnenolone, specific enzymes of each
    cortical layer further modify it. \n\nEnzymes involved in this process include
    both mitochondrial and microsomal P450s and hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases. \n\nUsually
    a number of intermediate steps in which pregnenolone is modified several times
    are required to form the functional hormones. \n\nEnzymes that catalyze reactions
    in these metabolic pathways are involved in a number of endocrine diseases. \n\nFor
    example, the most common form of congenital suprarenal hyperplasia develops as
    a result of deficiency of 21-hydroxylase, an enzyme involved in an intermediate
    step of cortisol production.\n\nRegulation\n\nGlucocorticoids are under the regulatory
    influence of the hypothalamus-pituitary-suprarenal (HPA) axis. \n\nGlucocorticoid
    synthesis is stimulated by adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), a hormone released
    into the bloodstream by the anterior pituitary. \n\nIn turn, production of ACTH
    is stimulated by the presence of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), which
    is released by neurons of the hypothalamus. \n\nACTH acts on the suprarenal cells
    first by increasing the levels of StAR within the cells, and then of all steroidogenic
    P450 enzymes. \n\nThe HPA axis is an example of a negative feedback system, in
    which cortisol itself acts as a direct inhibitor of both CRH and ACTH synthesis.
    \n\nThe HPA axis also interacts with the immune system through increased secretion
    of ACTH at the presence of certain molecules of the inflammatory response.Mineralocorticoid
    secretion is regulated mainly by the renin\u2013angiotensin\u2013aldosterone
    system (RAAS), the concentration of potassium, and to a lesser extent the concentration
    of ACTH. \n\nSensors of blood pressure in the juxtaglomerular apparatus of the
    kidneys release the enzyme renin into the blood, which starts a cascade of reactions
    that lead to formation of angiotensin II. \n\nAngiotensin receptors in cells
    of the zona glomerulosa recognize the substance, and upon binding they stimulate
    the release of aldosterone.\n\n\n=== Androgens ===\n\nCells in zona reticularis
    of the suprarenal glands produce male sex hormones, or androgens, the most important
    of which is DHEA. \n\nIn general, these hormones do not have an overall effect
    in the male body, and are converted to more potent androgens such as testosterone
    and DHT or to estrogens (female sex hormones) in the gonads, acting in this way
    as a metabolic intermediate.\n\n\n=== Catecholamines ===\n\nPrimarily referred
    to in the United States as epinephrine and norepinephrine, suprarenaline and
    norsuprarenaline are catecholamines, water-soluble compounds that have a structure
    made of a catechol group and an amine group. \n\nThe suprarenal glands are responsible
    for most of the suprarenaline that circulates in the body, but only for a small
    amount of circulating norsuprarenaline. \n\nThese hormones are released by the
    suprarenal medulla, which contains a dense network of blood vessels. \n\nsuprarenaline
    and norsuprarenaline act at adrenoreceptors throughout the body, with effects
    that include an increase in blood pressure and heart rate. \n\nActions of suprarenaline
    and norsuprarenaline are responsible for the fight or flight response, characterised
    by a quickening of breathing and heart rate, an increase in blood pressure, and
    constriction of blood vessels in many parts of the body.\n\nFormationCatecholamines
    are produced in chromaffin cells in the medulla of the suprarenal gland, from
    tyrosine, a non-essential amino acid derived from food or produced from phenylalanine
    in the liver. \n\nThe enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase converts tyrosine to L-DOPA
    in the first step of catecholamine synthesis. \n\nL-DOPA is then converted to
    dopamine before it can be turned into norsuprarenaline. \n\nIn the cytosol, norsuprarenaline
    is converted to epinephrine by the enzyme phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase
    (PNMT) and stored in granules. \n\nGlucocorticoids produced in the suprarenal
    cortex stimulate the synthesis of catecholamines by increasing the levels of
    tyrosine hydroxylase and PNMT.Catecholamine release is stimulated by the activation
    of the sympathetic nervous system. \n\nSplanchnic nerves of the sympathetic nervous
    system innervate the medulla of the suprarenal gland. \n\nWhen activated, it
    evokes the release of catecholamines from the storage granules by stimulating
    the opening of calcium channels in the cell membrane.\n\n\n== Gene and protein
    expression ==\n\n\nThe human genome includes approximately 20,000 protein coding
    genes and 70% of these genes are expressed in the normal adult suprarenal glands.
    \n\nOnly some 250 genes are more specifically expressed in the suprarenal glands
    compared to other organs and tissues. \n\nThe suprarenal-gland-specific genes
    with the highest level of expression include members of the cytochrome P450 superfamily
    of enzymes. \n\nCorresponding proteins are expressed in the different compartments
    of the suprarenal gland, such as CYP11A1, HSD3B2 and FDX1 involved in steroid
    hormone synthesis and expressed in cortical cell layers, and PNMT and DBH involved
    in norsuprarenaline and suprarenaline synthesis and expressed in the medulla.\n\n\n==
    Development ==\n\nThe suprarenal glands are composed of two heterogenous types
    of tissue. \n\nIn the center is the suprarenal medulla, which produces suprarenaline
    and norsuprarenaline and releases them into the bloodstream, as part of the sympathetic
    nervous system. \n\nSurrounding the medulla is the cortex, which produces a variety
    of steroid hormones. \n\nThese tissues come from different embryological precursors
    and have distinct prenatal development paths. \n\nThe cortex of the suprarenal
    gland is derived from mesoderm, whereas the medulla is derived from the neural
    crest, which is of ectodermal origin.\n\nThe suprarenal glands in a newborn baby
    are much larger as a proportion of the body size than in an adult. \n\nFor example,
    at age three months the glands are four times the size of the kidneys. \n\nThe
    size of the glands decreases relatively after birth, mainly because of shrinkage
    of the cortex. \n\nThe cortex, which almost completely disappears by age 1, develops
    again from age 4\u20135. \n\nThe glands weigh about 1 g at birth and develop
    to an adult weight of about 4 grams each. \n\nIn a fetus the glands are first
    detectable after the sixth week of development.\n\n\n=== Cortex ===\n\nsuprarenal
    cortex tissue is derived from the intermediate mesoderm. \n\nIt first appears
    33 days after fertilisation, shows steroid hormone production capabilities by
    the eighth week and undergoes rapid growth during the first trimester of pregnancy.
    \n\nThe fetal suprarenal cortex is different from its adult counterpart, as it
    is composed of two distinct zones: the inner \"fetal\" zone, which carries most
    of the hormone-producing activity, and the outer \"definitive\" zone, which is
    in a proliferative phase. \n\nThe fetal zone produces large amounts of suprarenal
    androgens (male sex hormones) that are used by the placenta for estrogen biosynthesis.
    \n\nCortical development of the suprarenal gland is regulated mostly by ACTH,
    a hormone produced by the pituitary gland that stimulates cortisol synthesis.
    \n\nDuring midgestation, the fetal zone occupies most of the cortical volume
    and produces 100\u2013200 mg/day of DHEA-S, an androgen and precursor of both
    androgens and estrogens (female sex hormones). \n\nsuprarenal hormones, especially
    glucocorticoids such as cortisol, are essential for prenatal development of organs,
    particularly for the maturation of the lungs. \n\nThe suprarenal gland decreases
    in size after birth because of the rapid disappearance of the fetal zone, with
    a corresponding decrease in androgen secretion.\n\n\n==== Adrenarche ====\n\nDuring
    early childhood androgen synthesis and secretion remain low, but several years
    before puberty (from 6\u20138 years of age) changes occur in both anatomical
    and functional aspects of cortical androgen production that lead to increased
    secretion of the steroids DHEA and DHEA-S. \n\nThese changes are part of a process
    called adrenarche, which has only been described in humans and some other primates.
    \n\nAdrenarche is independent of ACTH or gonadotropins and correlates with a
    progressive thickening of the zona reticularis layer of the cortex. \n\nFunctionally,
    adrenarche provides a source of androgens for the development of axillary and
    pubic hair before the beginning of puberty.\n\n\n=== Medulla ===\n\nThe suprarenal
    medulla is derived from neural crest cells, which come from the ectoderm layer
    of the embryo. \n\nThese cells migrate from their initial position and aggregate
    in the vicinity of the dorsal aorta, a primitive blood vessel, which activates
    the differentiation of these cells through the release of proteins known as BMPs.
    \n\nThese cells then undergo a second migration from the dorsal aorta to form
    the suprarenal medulla and other organs of the sympathetic nervous system. \n\nCells
    of the suprarenal medulla are called chromaffin cells because they contain granules
    that stain with chromium salts, a characteristic not present in all sympathetic
    organs. \n\nGlucocorticoids produced in the suprarenal cortex were once thought
    to be responsible for the differentiation of chromaffin cells. \n\nMore recent
    research suggests that BMP-4 secreted in suprarenal tissue is the main responsible
    for this, and that glucocorticoids only play a role in the subsequent development
    of the cells.\n\n\n== Clinical significance ==\n\n\nThe normal function of the
    suprarenal gland may be impaired by conditions such as infections, tumors, genetic
    disorders and autoimmune diseases, or as a side effect of medical therapy. \n\nThese
    disorders affect the gland either directly (as with infections or autoimmune
    diseases) or as a result of the dysregulation of hormone production (as in some
    types of Cushing's syndrome) leading to an excess or insufficiency of suprarenal
    hormones and the related symptoms.\n\n\n=== Corticosteroid overproduction ===\n\n\n\n====
    Cushing's syndrome ====\nCushing's syndrome is the manifestation of glucocorticoid
    excess. \n\nIt can be the result of a prolonged treatment with glucocorticoids
    or be caused by an underlying disease which produces alterations in the HPA axis
    or the production of cortisol. \n\nCauses can be further classified into ACTH-dependent
    or ACTH-independent. \n\nThe most common cause of endogenous Cushing's syndrome
    is a pituitary adenoma which causes an excessive production of ACTH. \n\nThe
    disease produces a wide variety of signs and symptoms which include obesity,
    diabetes, increased blood pressure, excessive body hair (hirsutism), osteoporosis,
    depression, and most distinctively, stretch marks in the skin, caused by its
    progressive thinning.\n\n\n==== Primary aldosteronism ====\n\nWhen the zona glomerulosa
    produces excess aldosterone, the result is primary aldosteronism. \n\nCauses
    for this condition are bilateral hyperplasia (excessive tissue growth) of the
    glands, or aldosterone-producing adenomas (a condition called Conn's syndrome).
    \n\nPrimary aldosteronism produces hypertension and electrolyte imbalance, increasing
    potassium depletion sodium retention.\n\n\n=== suprarenal insufficiency ===\n\nsuprarenal
    insufficiency (the deficiency of glucocorticoids) occurs in about 5 in 10,000
    in the general population. \n\nDiseases classified as primary suprarenal insufficiency
    (including Addison's disease and genetic causes) directly affect the suprarenal
    cortex. \n\nIf a problem that affects the hypothalamic-pituitary-suprarenal axis
    arises outside the gland, it is a secondary suprarenal insufficiency.\n\n\n====
    Addison's disease ====\n\nAddison's disease refers to primary hyposuprarenalism,
    which is a deficiency in glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid production by the
    suprarenal gland. \n\nIn the Western world, Addison's disease is most commonly
    an autoimmune condition, in which the body produces antibodies against cells
    of the suprarenal cortex. \n\nWorldwide, the disease is more frequently caused
    by infection, especially from tuberculosis. \n\nA distinctive feature of Addison's
    disease is hyperpigmentation of the skin, which presents with other nonspecific
    symptoms such as fatigue.\n\nA complication seen in untreated Addison's disease
    and other types of primary suprarenal insufficiency is the suprarenal crisis,
    a medical emergency in which low glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid levels
    result in hypovolemic shock and symptoms such as vomiting and fever. \n\nAn suprarenal
    crisis can progressively lead to stupor and coma. \n\nThe management of suprarenal
    crises includes the application of hydrocortisone injections.\n\n\n==== Secondary
    suprarenal insufficiency ====\n\nIn secondary suprarenal insufficiency, a dysfunction
    of the hypothalamic-pituitary-suprarenal axis leads to decreased stimulation
    of the suprarenal cortex. \n\nApart from suppression of the axis by glucocorticoid
    therapy, the most common cause of secondary suprarenal insufficiency are tumors
    that affect the production of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) by the pituitary
    gland. \n\nThis type of suprarenal insufficiency usually does not affect the
    production of mineralocorticoids, which are under regulation of the renin\u2013angiotensin
    system instead.\n\n\n==== Congenital suprarenal hyperplasia ====\n\nCongenital
    suprarenal hyperplasia is a congenital disease in which mutations of enzymes
    that produce steroid hormones result in a glucocorticoid deficiency and malfunction
    of the negative feedback loop of the HPA axis. \n\nIn the HPA axis, cortisol
    (a glucocorticoid) inhibits the release of CRH and ACTH, hormones that in turn
    stimulate corticosteroid synthesis. \n\nAs cortisol cannot be synthesized, these
    hormones are released in high quantities and stimulate production of other suprarenal
    steroids instead. \n\nThe most common form of congenital suprarenal hyperplasia
    is due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency. 21-hydroxylase is necessary for production
    of both mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids, but not androgens. \n\nTherefore,
    ACTH stimulation of the suprarenal cortex induces the release of excessive amounts
    of suprarenal androgens, which can lead to the development of ambiguous genitalia
    and secondary sex characteristics.\n\n\n=== suprarenal tumors ===\n\n\nsuprarenal
    tumors are commonly found as incidentalomas, unexpected asymptomatic tumors found
    during medical imaging. \n\nThey are seen in around 3.4% of CT scans, and in
    most cases they are benign adenomas. \n\nsuprarenal carcinomas are very rare,
    with an incidence of 1 case per million per year.Pheochromocytomas are tumors
    of the suprarenal medulla that arise from chromaffin cells. \n\nThey can produce
    a variety of nonspecific symptoms, which include headaches, sweating, anxiety
    and palpitations. \n\nCommon signs include hypertension and tachycardia. \n\nSurgery,
    especially suprarenal laparoscopy, is the most common treatment for small pheochromocytomas.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/suprarenal_gland"

  descriptionText: "\n\nSUBLINGUAL GLAND\n\n\nThe paired sublingual glands are major
    salivary glands in the mouth. \n\nThey are the smallest, most diffuse, and the
    only unencapsulated major salivary glands. \n\nThey provide only 3-5% of the
    total salivary volume. \n\nThere are also two other types of salivary glands;
    they are submandibular and parotid glands.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThey lie anterior
    and superior to the submandibular gland and inferior and lateral to the tongue,
    as well as beneath the mucous membrane of the floor of the mouth. \n\nThey are
    bounded laterally by the bone of the mandible and inferolaterally by the mylohyoid
    muscle. \n\nThe glands can be felt behind each mandibular canine. \n\nPlacing
    one index finger within the mouth and the fingertips of the opposite hand outside
    it, the compressed gland is manually palpated between the inner and outer fingers.\nThe
    sublingual glands are drained by 8-20 excretory ducts called the ducts of Rivinus.
    \n\nThe largest of all, the sublingual duct (of Bartholin) joins the submandibular
    duct to drain through the sublingual caruncle. \n\nThe sublingual caruncle is
    a small papilla near the midline of the floor of the mouth on each side of the
    lingual frenum. \n\nMost of the remaining small sublingual ducts (of Rivinus)
    open separate into the mouth on an elevated crest of mucous membrane, the plica
    sublingualis (aka sublingual fold), formed by the gland and located on either
    side of the frenulum linguae. \n\n\n=== Microanatomy ===\n\nThe sublingual gland
    consists mostly of mucous acini capped with serous demilunes and is therefore
    categorized as a mixed mucous gland with a mucous product predominating. \n\nStriated
    and intercalated ducts are also present.\n\n\n=== Blood supply ===\n\nThe gland
    receives its blood supply from the sublingual and submental arteries. \n\nLymph
    from the sublingual salivary gland drains into the submandibular lymph nodes.\n\n\n===
    Nerve supply ===\n\nThe chorda tympani nerve (from the facial nerve via the submandibular
    ganglion) is secretomotor and provides parasympathetic supply to the sublingual
    glands. \n\nThe path of the nerve is as follows: junction between pons and medulla,
    through internal acoustic meatus and facial canal to chorda tympani, through
    middle ear cavity, out petrotympanic fissure to join the lingual nerve, travels
    with lingual nerve to synapse at the submandibular ganglion, then postganglionic
    fibers travels to the sublingual gland.\n\n\n=== Development ===\n\nThe sublingual
    salivary glands appear in the eighth week of prenatal development, two weeks
    later than the other two major salivary glands. \n\nThey develop from epithelial
    buds in the sulcus surrounding the sublingual folds on the floor of the mouth,
    lateral to the developing submandibular gland. \n\nThese buds branch and form

  descriptionText: "\n\nBILE DUCT\n\n\nA bile duct is any of a number of long tube-like
    structures that carry bile, and is present in most vertebrates.\nBile is required
    for the digestion of food and is secreted by the liver into passages that carry
    bile toward the hepatic duct. \n\nIt joins the cystic duct (carrying bile to
    and from the gallbladder) to form the common bile duct which then opens into
    the intestine.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe top half of the common bile duct is
    associated with the liver, while the bottom half of the common bile duct is associated
    with the pancreas, through which it passes on its way to the intestine. \n\nIt
    opens into the part of the intestine called the duodenum via the ampulla of Vater.\n\n\n==
    Segments ==\n\nThe biliary tree (see below) is the whole network of various sized
    ducts branching through the liver.\nThe path is as follows: Bile canaliculi \u2192
    Canals of Hering \u2192 interlobular bile ducts \u2192 intrahepatic bile ducts
    \u2192 left and right hepatic ducts merge to form \u2192 common hepatic duct
    exits liver and joins \u2192 cystic duct (from gall bladder) forming \u2192 common
    bile duct \u2192 joins with pancreatic duct \u2192 forming ampulla of Vater \u2192
    enters duodenum.\n\n\n=== Nerve supply ===\n\nInflation of a balloon in the bile
    duct causes, through the vagus nerve, activation of the brain stem and the insular
    cortex, prefrontal cortex, and somatosensory cortex.\n\n\n== Clinical significance
    ==\n\n\n\n=== Blockage ===\n\nBlockage or obstruction of the bile duct by gallstones,
    scarring from injury, or cancer prevents the bile from being transported to the
    intestine and the active ingredient in the bile (bilirubin) instead accumulates
    in the blood. \n\nThis condition results in jaundice, where the skin and eyes
    become yellow from the bilirubin in the blood. \n\nThis condition also causes
    severe itchiness from the bilirubin deposited in the tissues. \n\nIn certain
    types of jaundice, the urine will be noticeably darker, and the stools will be
    much paler than usual. \n\nThis is caused by the bilirubin all going to the bloodstream
    and being filtered into the urine by the kidneys, instead of some being lost
    in the stools through the ampulla of Vater.\n\n\n==== Jaundice ====\nJaundice
    is commonly caused by conditions such as pancreatic cancer, which causes blockage
    of the bile duct passing through the cancerous portion of the pancreas; cholangiocarcinoma,
    cancer of the bile ducts; blockage by a stone in patients with gallstones; and
    from scarring after injury to the bile duct during gallbladder removal.\n\n\n====
    Drainage ====\nBiliary drainage is performed with a tube or catheter (called
    a biliary drain, biliary stent or biliary catheter) by a surgeon or, commonly,
    an interventional radiologist. \n\nIt can be used to relieve a blockage in the
    bile duct, either permanently or as a temporary solution before definite treatment
    such as surgery. \n\nThe drain can be placed percutaneously through the liver,
    with the procedure then being called percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage
    (PTBD). \n\nThis can additionally be performed as part of a percutaneous transhepatic
    cholangiography, then a form of interventional radiology. \n\nA biliary drain
    can also be used to take bile samples for diagnostic workup or disease monitoring,
    as well as providing a route of administration for medical substances.\n\nA surgically
    created passage between the common bile duct and the jejunum in a procedure called
    a choledochojejunostomy, can be carried out to relieve the symptoms of biliary
    obstruction.\nIn infants with biliary atresia, hepatoportoenterostomy is an alternative
    method of providing bile drainage.\n\n\n=== Cholangiocarcinoma ===\n\n\nCholangiocarcinoma
    or bile duct cancer is a form of cancer that is composed of mutated epithelial
    cells (or cells showing characteristics of epithelial differentiation) that originate
    in the bile ducts. \n\nCholangiocarcinoma is considered to be an incurable and
    rapidly lethal cancer unless both the primary tumor and any metastases can be
    fully removed by surgery. \n\nNo potentially curative treatment exists except
    surgery, but most people have advanced stage disease at presentation and are
    inoperable at the time of diagnosis.\n\n\n=== Injury ===\n\nIn cholecystectomy
    there is a slight risk (0.3\u20130.5%) of injury of the bile ducts, most commonly
    of the common bile duct. \n\nThis complication can range from mild forms, which
    are easy to address during the operation, to more severe forms. \n\nIf not addressed
    such injury can be debilitating and lead to considerable morbidity. \n\nSuch
    injury can be prevented by routinely using X-ray investigation of the bile ducts
    (intraoperative cholangiography (IOC)).\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile_duct"

  descriptionText: "\n\nSUBMANDIBULAR GLAND\n\n\nThe paired submandibular glands
    (historically known as submaxillary glands) are major salivary glands located
    beneath the floor of the mouth. \n\nThey each weigh about 15 grams and contribute
    some 60\u201367% of unstimulated saliva secretion; on stimulation their contribution
    decreases in proportion as the parotid secretion rises to 50%. \n\nThe average
    length of the normal human submandibular salivary gland is approximately 27mm,
    while the average width is approximately 14.3mm.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\n\nLying
    superior to the digastric muscles, each submandibular gland is divided into superficial
    and deep lobes, which are separated by the mylohyoid muscle:\nThe superficial
    lobe comprises most of the gland, with the mylohyoid muscle runs under it\nThe
    deep lobe is the smaller partSecretions are delivered into the submandibular
    duct on the deep portion after which they hook around the posterior edge of the
    mylohyoid muscle and proceed on the superior surface laterally. \n\nThe excretory
    ducts are then crossed by the lingual nerve, and ultimately drain into the sublingual
    caruncles \u2013 small prominences on either side of the lingual frenulum along
    with the major sublingual duct. \n\nThe gland can be bilaterally palpated (felt)
    inferior and posterior to the body of the mandible, moving inward from the inferior
    border of the mandible near its angle with the head tilted forwards.\n\n\n===
    Microanatomy ===\n\n\nLobes contain smaller lobules, which contain adenomeres,
    the secretory units of the gland. \n\nEach adenomer contains one or more acini,
    or alveoli, which are small clusters of cells that secrete their products into
    a duct. \n\nThe acini of each adenomere are composed of either serous or mucous
    cells, with serous adenomeres predominating. \n\nSome mucous adenomeres may also
    be capped with a serous demilune, a layer of lysozyme-secreting serous cells
    resembling a half moon.\nLike other exocrine glands, the submandibular gland
    can be classified by the microscopic anatomy of its secretory cells and how they
    are arranged. \n\nBecause the glands are branched, and because the tubules forming
    the branches contain secretory cells, submandibular glands are classified as
    branched tubuloacinar glands. \n\nFurther, because the secretory cells are of
    both serous and mucous types, the submandibular gland is a mixed gland, and though
    most of the cells are serous, the exudate is chiefly mucous. \n\nIt has long
    striated ducts and short intercalated ducts.The secretory acinar cells of the
    submandibular gland have distinct functions. \n\nThe mucous cells are the most
    active and therefore the major product of the submandibular glands is saliva
    which is mucoid in nature. \n\nMucous cells secrete mucin which aids in the lubrication
    of the food bolus as it travels through the esophagus. \n\nIn addition, the serous
    cells produce salivary amylase, which aids in the breakdown of starches in the
    mouth. \n\nThe submandibular gland's highly active acini account for most of
    the salivary volume. \n\nThe parotid and sublingual glands account for the remaining.\n\n\n===
    Blood supply ===\n\nThe gland receives its blood supply from the facial and lingual
    arteries. \n\nThe gland is supplied by sublingual and submental arteries and
    drained by common facial and lingual veins.\n\n\n=== Lymphatic drainage ===\n\nThe
    lymphatics from submandibular gland first drain into submandibular lymph nodes
    and subsequently into jugulo - digastric lymph nodes.\n\n\n=== Nerve supply ===\n\n\nTheir
    secretions, like the secretions of other salivary glands, are regulated directly
    by the parasympathetic nervous system and indirectly by the sympathetic nervous
    system.\n\nParasympathetic innervation to the submandibular glands is provided
    by the superior salivatory nucleus via the chorda tympani, a branch of the facial
    nerve, that becomes part of the trigeminal nerve's lingual nerve prior to synapsing
    on the submandibular ganglion. \n\nIncreased parasympathetic activity promotes
    the secretion of saliva.\nThe sympathetic nervous system regulates submandibular
    secretions through vasoconstriction of the arteries that supply it. \n\nIncreased
    sympathetic activity reduces glandular bloodflow, thereby decreasing the volume
    of fluid in salivary secretions, producing an enzyme rich mucous saliva. \n\nNevertheless,
    direct stimulation of sympathetic nerves will cause an increase in salivary enzymatic
    secretions. \n\nIn sum, the volume decreases, but the secretions are increased
    by parasympathetic and sympathetic innervation.\n\n\n=== Development ===\n\nThe
    submandibular salivary glands develop later than the parotid glands and appear
    late in the sixth week of prenatal development. \n\nThey develop bilaterally
    from epithelial buds in the sulcus surrounding the sublingual folds on the floor
    of the primitive mouth. \n\nSolid cords branch from the buds and grow posteriorly,
    lateral to the developing tongue. \n\nThe cords of the submandibular gland later
    branch further and then become canalized to form the ductal part. \n\nThe submandibular
    gland acini develop from the cords\u2019 rounded terminal ends at 12 weeks, and
    secretory activity via the submandibular duct begins at 16 weeks. \n\nGrowth
    of the submandibular gland continues after birth with the formation of more acini.
    \n\nLateral to both sides of the tongue, a linear groove develops and closes
    over to form the submandibular duct.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\nThe submandibular
    gland releases a host of factors which regulate systemic inflammatory responses
    and modulate systemic immune and inflammatory reactions. \n\nEarly work in identifying
    factors that played a role in the cervical sympathetic trunk-submandibular gland
    (CST-SMG) axis lead to the discovery of a seven amino acid peptide, called the
    submandibular gland peptide-T. \n\nSGP-T was demonstrated to have biological
    activity and thermoregulatory properties related to endotoxin exposure. \n\nSGP-T,
    an isolate of the submandibular gland, demonstrated its immunoregulatory properties
    and potential role in modulating the CST-SMG axis, and subsequently was shown
    to play an important role in the control of inflammation. \n\n\n== Clinical significance
    ==\n\n\nThe submandibular gland accounts for 80% of all salivary duct calculi
    (salivary stones or sialolith), possibly due to the different nature of the saliva
    that it produces and the tortuous travel of the submandibular duct to its ductal
    opening for a considerable upward distance. \n\nThe submandibular gland is one
    of the major three glands that provide the mouth with saliva. \n\nThe\ntwo other
    types of salivary glands are parotid and sublingual glands.\n\n\n=== Dissection

  descriptionText: "\n\nEPIDIDYMIS\n\n\nThe epididymis (; plural: epididymides or
    ) is a tube that connects a testicle to a vas deferens in the male reproductive
    system. \n\nIt is present in all male reptiles, birds, and mammals. \n\nIt is
    a single, narrow, tightly-coiled tube in adult humans, 6 to 7 meters (20 to 23
    ft) in length connecting the efferent ducts from the rear of each testicle to
    its vas deferens.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe epididymis can be divided into
    three main regions:\n\nThe head (Latin: caput). \n\nThe head of the epididymis
    receives spermatozoa via the efferent ducts of the mediastinium of the testis.
    \n\nIt is characterized histologically by a thick epithelium with long stereocilia
    (described below) and a little smooth muscle. \n\nIt is involved in absorbing
    fluid to make the sperm more concentrated. \n\nThe concentration of the sperm
    here is dilute.\nThe body (Latin: corpus). \n\nThis has an intermediate epithelium
    and smooth muscle thickness.\nThe tail (Latin: cauda). \n\nThis has the thinnest
    epithelium of the three regions and the greatest quantity of smooth muscle.In
    reptiles, there is an additional canal between the testis and the head of the
    epididymis and which receives the various efferent ducts. \n\nThis is, however,
    absent in all birds and mammals.\n\n\n=== Histology ===\n\nThe epididymis is
    covered by a two layered pseudostratified epithelium. \n\nThe epithelium is separated
    by a basement membrane from the connective tissue wall which has smooth muscle
    cells. \n\nThe major cell types in the epithelium are:\n\nPrincipal cells: columnar
    cells that, with the basal cells, form the majority of the epithelium. \n\nIn
    the caput (head) region these cells have long stereocilia that are tuft-like
    extensions that project into the lumen. \n\nThe sterocilia are much shorter in
    the cauda (tail) segment. \n\nThey also secrete carnitine, sialic acid, glycoproteins,
    and glycerylphosphorylcholine into the lumen.\nBasal cells: shorter, pyramid-shaped
    cells which contact the basal lamina but taper off before their apical surfaces
    reach the lumen. \n\nThese are thought to be undifferentiated precursors of principal
    cells.\nApical cells: predominantly found in the head region\nClear cells: predominant
    in the tail region\nIntraepithelial lymphocytes: distributed throughout the tissue.\nIntraepithelial
    macrophages\n\n\n==== Stereocilia ====\nThe stereocilia of the epididymis are
    long cytoplasmic projections that have an actin filament backbone. \n\nThese
    filaments have been visualized at high resolution using fluorescent phalloidin
    that binds to actin filaments.\nThe stereocilia in the epididymis are non-motile.
    \n\nThese membrane extensions increase the surface area of the cell, allowing
    for greater absorption and secretion. \n\nIt has been shown that epithelial sodium
    channel ENaC that allows the flow of Na+ ions into the cell is localized on stereocilia.Because
    sperm are initially non-motile as they leave the seminiferous tubules, large
    volumes of fluid are secreted to propel them to the epididymis. \n\nThe core
    function of the stereocilia is to resorb 90% of this fluid as the spermatozoa
    start to become motile. \n\nThis absorption creates a fluid current that moves
    the immobile sperm from the seminiferous tubules to the epididymis. \n\nSpermatozoa
    do not reach full motility until they reach the vagina, where the alkaline pH
    is neutralized by acidic vaginal fluids.\n\n\n=== Development ===\n\nIn the embryo,
    the epididymis develops from tissue that once formed the mesonephros, a primitive
    kidney found in many aquatic vertebrates. \n\nPersistence of the cranial end
    of the mesonephric duct will leave behind a remnant called the appendix of the
    epididymis. \n\nIn addition, some mesonephric tubules can persist as the paradidymis,
    a small body caudal to the efferent ductules.\nA Gartner's duct is a homologous
    remnant in the female.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\n\n\n=== Role in storage of sperm
    and ejaculant ===\n\nSpermatozoa formed in the testis enter the caput epididymis,
    progress to the corpus, and finally reach the cauda region, where they are stored.
    \n\nSperm entering the caput epididymis are incomplete\u2014they lack the ability
    to swim forward (motility) and to fertilize an egg. \n\nEpididymal transit takes
    2 to 6 days in humans and 10\u201313 in rodents. \n\nDuring their transit in
    the epididymis, sperm undergo maturation processes necessary for them to acquire
    motility and fertility. \n\nFinal maturation (capacitation) is completed in the
    female reproductive tract.\nThe epididymis secretes immobilin, a large glycoprotein
    that is responsible for the creating of the viscoelastic luminal environment
    that serves to mechanically immobilize spermatozoa until ejaculation. \n\nImmobilin
    is predominantly secreted into the proximal caput epididymis prior to the acquisition
    of the potential for sperm motility. \n\nDuring ejaculation, sperm flow from
    the cauda epididymis (which functions as a storage reservoir) into the vas deferens
    where they are propelled by the peristaltic action of muscle layers in the wall
    of the vas deferens, and are mixed with the diluting fluids of the prostate,
    seminal vesicles, and other accessory glands prior to ejaculation (forming semen).\n\n\n==
    Clinical significance ==\n\n\n\n=== Inflammation ===\n\nAn inflammation of the
    epididymis is called epididymitis. \n\nIt is much more common than testicular
    inflammation, termed orchitis.\n\n\n=== Surgical removal ===\n\nEpididymotomy
    is the placing of an incision into the epididymis and is sometimes considered
    as a treatment option for acute suppurating epididymitis.\nEpididymectomy is
    the surgical removal of the epididymis sometimes performed for post-vasectomy
    pain syndrome and for refractory cases of epididymitis.\nEpididymectomy is also
    performed for sterilization on some male animals of livestock species so they
    can be used to detect estrus in females ready for artificially insemination.\n\n\n==

  descriptionText: "\n\nMIDDLE LOBE OF RIGHT LUNG/\nLUNG\n\n\nThe lungs are the primary
    organs of the respiratory system in humans and most other animals including a
    few fish, and some snails. \n\nIn mammals and most other vertebrates, two lungs
    are located near the backbone on either side of the heart. \n\nTheir function
    in the respiratory system is to extract oxygen from the air and transfer it into
    the bloodstream, and to release carbon dioxide from the bloodstream into the
    atmosphere, in a process of gas exchange. \n\nRespiration is driven by different
    muscular systems in different species. \n\nMammals, reptiles and birds use their
    different muscles to support and foster breathing. \n\nIn earlier tetrapods,
    air was driven into the lungs by the pharyngeal muscles via buccal pumping, a
    mechanism still seen in amphibians. \n\nIn humans, the main muscle of respiration
    that drives breathing is the diaphragm. \n\nThe lungs also provide airflow that
    makes vocal sounds including human speech possible.\nHumans have two lungs, a
    right lung, and a left lung. \n\nThey are situated within the thoracic cavity
    of the chest. \n\nThe right lung is bigger than the left, which shares space
    in the chest with the heart. \n\nThe lungs together weigh approximately 1.3 kilograms
    (2.9 lb), and the right is heavier. \n\nThe lungs are part of the lower respiratory
    tract that begins at the trachea and branches into the bronchi and bronchioles,
    and which receive air breathed in via the conducting zone. \n\nThe conducting
    zone ends at the terminal bronchioles. \n\nThese divide into the respiratory
    bronchioles of the respiratory zone which divide into alveolar ducts that give
    rise to the alveolar sacs that contain the alveoli, where gas exchange takes
    place. \n\nAlveoli are also sparsely present on the walls of the respiratory
    bronchioles and alveolar ducts. \n\nTogether, the lungs contain approximately
    2,400 kilometres (1,500 mi) of airways and 300 to 500 million alveoli. \n\nEach
    lung is enclosed within a pleural sac of two membranes called pleurae; the membranes
    are separated by a film of pleural fluid, which allows the inner and outer membranes
    to slide over each other whilst breathing takes place, without much friction.
    \n\nThe inner pleura also divides each lung into sections called lobes. \n\nThe
    right lung has three lobes and the left has two. \n\nThe lobes are further divided
    into bronchopulmonary segments and pulmonary lobules. \n\nThe lungs have a unique
    blood supply, receiving deoxygenated blood from the heart in the pulmonary circulation
    for the purposes of receiving oxygen and releasing carbon dioxide, and a separate
    supply of oxygenated blood to the tissue of the lungs, in the bronchial circulation.\nThe
    tissue of the lungs can be affected by a number of respiratory diseases, including
    pneumonia and lung cancer. \n\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease includes
    chronic bronchitis and emphysema, and can be related to smoking or exposure to
    harmful substances. \n\nA number of occupational lung diseases can be caused
    by substances such as coal dust, asbestos fibres, and crystalline silica dust.
    \n\nDiseases such as bronchitis can also affect the respiratory tract. \n\nMedical
    terms related to the lung often begin with pulmo-, from the Latin pulmonarius
    (of the lungs) as in pulmonology, or with pneumo- (from Greek \u03C0\u03BD\u03B5\u03CD\u03BC\u03C9\u03BD
    \"lung\") as in pneumonia.\nIn embryonic development, the lungs begin to develop
    as an outpouching of the foregut, a tube which goes on to form the upper part
    of the digestive system. \n\nWhen the lungs are formed the fetus is held in the
    fluid-filled amniotic sac and so they do not function to breathe. \n\nBlood is
    also diverted from the lungs through the ductus arteriosus. \n\nAt birth however,
    air begins to pass through the lungs, and the diversionary duct closes, so that
    the lungs can begin to respire. \n\nThe lungs only fully develop in early childhood.\n\n\n==
    Structure ==\n\n\n\n=== Anatomy ===\n\n\nThe lungs are located in the chest on
    either side of the heart in the rib cage. \n\nThey are conical in shape with
    a narrow rounded apex at the top, and a broad concave base that rests on the
    convex surface of the diaphragm. \n\nThe apex of the lung extends into the root
    of the neck, reaching shortly above the level of the sternal end of the first
    rib. \n\nThe lungs stretch from close to the backbone in the rib cage to the
    front of the chest and downwards from the lower part of the trachea to the diaphragm.
    \n\nThe left lung shares space with the heart, and has an indentation in its
    border called the cardiac notch of the left lung to accommodate this. \n\nThe
    front and outer sides of the lungs face the ribs, which make light indentations
    on their surfaces. \n\nThe medial surfaces of the lungs face towards the centre
    of the chest, and lie against the heart, great vessels, and the carina where
    the trachea divides into the two main bronchi. \n\nThe cardiac impression is
    an indentation formed on the surfaces of the lungs where they rest against the
    heart.\nBoth lungs have a central recession called the hilum at the root of the
    lung, where the blood vessels and airways pass into the lungs. \n\nThere are
    also bronchopulmonary lymph nodes on the hilum.The lungs are surrounded by the
    pulmonary pleurae. \n\nThe pleurae are two serous membranes; the outer parietal
    pleura lines the inner wall of the rib cage and the inner visceral pleura directly
    lines the surface of the lungs. \n\nBetween the pleurae is a potential space
    called the pleural cavity containing a thin layer of lubricating pleural fluid.\n\n\n====
    Lobes ====\nEach lung is divided into sections called lobes by the infoldings
    of the visceral pleura as fissures. \n\nLobes are divided into segments, and
    segments have further divisions as lobules. \n\nThere are three lobes in the
    right lung and two lobes in the left lung. \n\n\n==== Fissures ====\nThe fissures
    are formed in early prenatal development by invaginations of the visceral pleura
    that divide the lobar bronchi, and section the lungs into lobes that helps in
    their expansion. \n\nThe right lung is divided into three lobes by a horizontal
    fissure, and an oblique fissure. \n\nThe left lung is divided into two lobes
    by an oblique fissure which is closely aligned with the oblique fissure in the
    right lung. \n\nIn the right lung the upper horizontal fissure, separates the
    upper (superior) lobe from the middle lobe. \n\nThe lower, oblique fissure separates
    the lower lobe from the middle and upper lobes.Variations in the fissures are
    fairly common being either incompletely formed \nor present as an extra fissure
    as in the azygos fissure, or absent. \n\nIncomplete fissures are responsible
    for interlobar collateral ventilation, airflow between lobes which is unwanted
    in some lung volume reduction procedures.\n\n\n==== Segments ====\nThe main or
    primary bronchi enter the lungs at the hilum and initially branch into secondary
    bronchi also known as lobar bronchi that supply air to each lobe of the lung.
    \n\nThe lobar bronchi branch into tertiary bronchi also known as segmental bronchi
    and these supply air to the further divisions of the lobes known as bronchopulmonary
    segments. \n\nEach bronchopulmonary segment has its own (segmental) bronchus
    and arterial supply. \n\nSegments for the left and right lung are shown in the
    table. \n\nThe segmental anatomy is useful clinically for localising disease
    processes in the lungs. \n\nA segment is a discrete unit that can be surgically
    removed without seriously affecting surrounding tissue.\n\n\n=== Right lung ===\n\nThe
    right lung has both more lobes and segments than the left. \n\nIt is divided
    into three lobes, an upper, middle, and a lower lobe by two fissures, one oblique
    and one horizontal. \n\nThe upper, horizontal fissure, separates the upper from
    the middle lobe. \n\nIt begins in the lower oblique fissure near the posterior
    border of the lung, and, running horizontally forward, cuts the anterior border
    on a level with the sternal end of the fourth costal cartilage; on the mediastinal
    surface it may be traced back to the hilum. \n\nThe lower, oblique fissure, separates
    the lower from the middle and upper lobes and is closely aligned with the oblique
    fissure in the left lung.The mediastinal surface of the right lung is indented
    by a number of nearby structures. \n\nThe heart sits in an impression called
    the cardiac impression. \n\nAbove the hilum of the lung is an arched groove for
    the azygos vein, and above this is a wide groove for the superior vena cava and
    right brachiocephalic vein; behind this, and close to the top of the lung is
    a groove for the brachiocephalic artery. \n\nThere is a groove for the esophagus
    behind the hilum and the pulmonary ligament, and near the lower part of the esophageal
    groove is a deeper groove for the inferior vena cava before it enters the heart.The
    weight of the right lung varies between individuals, with a standard reference
    range in men of 155\u2013720 g (0.342\u20131.587 lb) and in women of 100\u2013590
    g (0.22\u20131.30 lb).\n\n\n=== Left lung ===\n\nThe left lung is divided into
    two lobes, an upper and a lower lobe, by the oblique fissure, which extends from
    the costal to the mediastinal surface of the lung both above and below the hilum.
    \n\nThe left lung, unlike the right, does not have a middle lobe, though it does
    have a homologous feature, a projection of the upper lobe termed the lingula.
    \n\nIts name means \"little tongue\". \n\nThe lingula on the left lung serves
    as an anatomic parallel to the middle lobe on the right lung, with both areas
    being predisposed to similar infections and anatomic complications. \n\nThere
    are two bronchopulmonary segments of the lingula: superior and inferior.The mediastinal
    surface of the left lung has a large cardiac impression where the heart sits.
    \n\nThis is deeper and larger than that on the right lung, at which level the
    heart projects to the left.On the same surface, immediately above the hilum,
    is a well-marked curved groove for the aortic arch, and a groove below it for
    the descending aorta. \n\nThe left subclavian artery, a branch off the aortic
    arch, sits in a groove from the arch to near the apex of the lung. \n\nA shallower
    groove in front of the artery and near the edge of the lung, lodges the left
    brachiocephalic vein. \n\nThe esophagus may sit in a wider shallow impression
    at the base of the lung.The weight of the left lung, by standard reference range,
    in men is 110\u2013675 g (0.243\u20131.488 lb) in women 105\u2013515 g (0.231\u20131.135
    lb).\n\n\n== Microanatomy ==\n\n\nThe lungs are part of the lower respiratory
    tract, and accommodate the bronchial airways when they branch from the trachea.
    \n\nThe bronchial airways terminate in alveoli which make up the functional tissue
    (parenchyma) of the lung, and veins, arteries, nerves, and lymphatic vessels.
    \n\nThe trachea and bronchi have plexuses of lymph capillaries in their mucosa
    and submucosa. \n\nThe smaller bronchi have a single layer of lymph capillaries,
    and they are absent in the alveoli. \n\nThe lungs are supplied with the largest
    lymphatic drainage system of any other organ in the body. \n\nEach lung is surrounded
    by a serous membrane of visceral pleura, which has an underlying layer of loose
    connective tissue attached to the substance of the lung.\n\n\n=== Connective
    tissue ===\n\nThe connective tissue of the lungs is made up of elastic and collagen
    fibres that are interspersed between the capillaries and the alveolar walls.
    \n\nElastin is the key protein of the extracellular matrix and is the main component
    of the elastic fibres. \n\nElastin gives the necessary elasticity and resilience
    required for the persistent stretching involved in breathing, known as lung compliance.
    \n\nIt is also responsible for the elastic recoil needed. \n\nElastin is more
    concentrated in areas of high stress such as the openings of the alveoli, and
    alveolar junctions. \n\nThe connective tissue links all the alveoli to form the
    lung parenchyma which has a sponge-like appearance. \n\nThe alveoli have interconnecting
    air passages in their walls known as the pores of Kohn.\n\n\n=== Respiratory
    epithelium ===\n\n\nAll of the lower respiratory tract including the trachea,
    bronchi, and bronchioles is lined with respiratory epithelium. \n\nThis is a
    ciliated epithelium interspersed with goblet cells which produce mucin the main
    component of mucus, ciliated cells, basal cells, and in the terminal bronchioles\u2013club
    cells with actions similar to basal cells, and macrophages. \n\nThe epithelial
    cells, and the submucosal glands throughout the respiratory tract secrete airway
    surface liquid (ASL), the composition of which is tightly regulated and determines
    how well mucociliary clearance works.Pulmonary neuroendocrine cells are found
    throughout the respiratory epithelium including the alveolar epithelium, though
    they only account for around 0.5 per cent of the total epithelial population.
    \n\nPNECs are innervated airway epithelial cells that are particularly focused
    at airway junction points. \n\nThese cells can produce serotonin, dopamine, and
    norepinephrine, as well as polypeptide products. \n\nCytoplasmic processes from
    the pulmonary neuroendocrine cells extend into the airway lumen where they may
    sense the composition of inspired gas.\n\n\n=== Bronchial airways ===\n\nIn the
    bronchi there are incomplete tracheal rings of cartilage and smaller plates of
    cartilage that keep them open.:\u200A472\u200A Bronchioles are too narrow to
    support cartilage and their walls are of smooth muscle, and this is largely absent
    in the narrower respiratory bronchioles which are mainly just of epithelium.:\u200A472\u200A
    The absence of cartilage in the terminal bronchioles gives them an alternative
    name of membranous bronchioles.\n\n\n=== Respiratory zone ===\n\nThe conducting
    zone of the respiratory tract ends at the terminal bronchioles when they branch
    into the respiratory bronchioles. \n\nThis marks the beginning of the terminal
    respiratory unit called the acinus which includes the respiratory bronchioles,
    the alveolar ducts, alveolar sacs, and alveoli. \n\nAn acinus measures up to
    10 mm in diameter. \n\nA primary pulmonary lobule is that part of the acinus
    that includes the alveolar ducts, sacs, and alveoli but does not include the
    respiratory bronchioles. \n\nThe unit described as the secondary pulmonary lobule
    is the lobule most referred to as the pulmonary lobule or respiratory lobule.:\u200A489\u200A
    This lobule is a discrete unit that is the smallest component of the lung that
    can be seen without aid. \n\nThe secondary pulmonary lobule is likely to be made
    up of between 30 and 50 primary lobules. \n\nThe lobule is supplied by a terminal
    bronchiole that branches into respiratory bronchioles. \n\nThe respiratory bronchioles
    supply the alveoli in each acinus and is accompanied by a pulmonary artery branch.
    \n\nEach lobule is enclosed by an interlobular septa. \n\nEach acinus is incompletely
    separated by an interlobular septa.The respiratory bronchiole gives rise to the
    alveolar ducts that lead to the alveolar sacs, which contain two or more alveoli.
    \n\nThe walls of the alveoli are extremely thin allowing a fast rate of diffusion.
    \n\nThe alveoli have interconnecting small air passages in their walls known
    as the pores of Kohn.\n\n\n=== Alveoli ===\n\n\nAlveoli consist of two types
    of alveolar cell and an alveolar macrophage. \n\nThe two types of cell are known
    as type I and type II cells (also known as pneumocytes). \n\nTypes I and II make
    up the walls and alveolar septa. \n\nType I cells provide 95% of the surface
    area of each alveoli and are flat (\"squamous\"), and Type II cells generally
    cluster in the corners of the alveoli and have a cuboidal shape. \n\nDespite
    this, cells occur in a roughly equal ratio of 1:1 or 6:4.Type I are squamous
    epithelial cells that make up the alveolar wall structure. \n\nThey have extremely
    thin walls that enable an easy gas exchange. \n\nThese type I cells also make
    up the alveolar septa which separate each alveolus. \n\nThe septa consist of
    an epithelial lining and associated basement membranes. \n\nType I cells are
    not able to divide, and consequently rely on differentiation from Type II cells.Type
    II are larger and they line the alveoli and produce and secrete epithelial lining
    fluid, and lung surfactant. \n\nType II cells are able to divide and differentiate
    to Type I cells.The alveolar macrophages have an important role in the immune
    system. \n\nThey remove substances which deposit in the alveoli including loose
    red blood cells that have been forced out from blood vessels.\n\n\n=== Microbiota
    ===\n\n\nThere is a large presence of microorganisms in the lungs known as the
    lung microbiota that interacts with the airway epithelial cells; an interaction
    of probable importance in maintaining homeostasis. \n\nThe microbiota is complex
    and dynamic in healthy people, and altered in diseases such as asthma and COPD.
    \n\nFor example significant changes can take place in COPD following infection
    with rhinovirus. \n\nFungal genera that are commonly found as mycobiota in the
    microbiota include Candida, Malassezia, Saccharomyces, and Aspergillus.\n\n\n===
    Respiratory tract ===\n\n\nThe lower respiratory tract is part of the respiratory
    system, and consists of the trachea and the structures below this including the
    lungs. \n\nThe trachea receives air from the pharynx and travels down to a place
    where it splits (the carina) into a right and left primary bronchus. \n\nThese
    supply air to the right and left lungs, splitting progressively into the secondary
    and tertiary bronchi for the lobes of the lungs, and into smaller and smaller
    bronchioles until they become the respiratory bronchioles. \n\nThese in turn
    supply air through alveolar ducts into the alveoli, where the exchange of gases
    take place. \n\nOxygen breathed in, diffuses through the walls of the alveoli
    into the enveloping capillaries and into the circulation, and carbon dioxide
    diffuses from the blood into the lungs to be breathed out.\nEstimates of the
    total surface area of lungs vary from 50 to 75 square metres (540 to 810 sq ft);
    although this is often quoted in textbooks and the media being \"the size of
    a tennis court\", it is actually less than half the size of a singles court.The
    bronchi in the conducting zone are reinforced with hyaline cartilage in order
    to hold open the airways. \n\nThe bronchioles have no cartilage and are surrounded
    instead by smooth muscle. \n\nAir is warmed to 37 \xB0C (99 \xB0F), humidified
    and cleansed by the conducting zone. \n\nParticles from the air being removed
    by the cilia on the respiratory epithelium lining the passageways, in a process
    called mucociliary clearance.\nPulmonary stretch receptors in the smooth muscle
    of the airways initiate a reflex known as the Hering\u2013Breuer reflex that
    prevents the lungs from over-inflation, during forceful inspiration.\n\n\n===
    Blood supply ===\n\n\nThe lungs have a dual blood supply provided by a bronchial
    and a pulmonary circulation. \n\nThe bronchial circulation supplies oxygenated
    blood to the airways of the lungs, through the bronchial arteries that leave
    the aorta. \n\nThere are usually three arteries, two to the left lung and one
    to the right, and they branch alongside the bronchi and bronchioles. \n\nThe
    pulmonary circulation carries deoxygenated blood from the heart to the lungs
    and returns the oxygenated blood to the heart to supply the rest of the body.The
    blood volume of the lungs is about 450 millilitres on average, about 9% of the
    total blood volume of the entire circulatory system. \n\nThis quantity can easily
    fluctuate from between one-half and twice the normal volume. \n\nAlso, in the
    event of blood loss through hemorrhage, blood from the lungs can partially compensate
    by automatically transferring to the systemic circulation.\n\n\n=== Nerve supply
    ===\n\nThe lungs are supplied by nerves of the autonomic nervous system. \n\nInput
    from the parasympathetic nervous system occurs via the vagus nerve. \n\nWhen
    stimulated by acetylcholine, this causes constriction of the smooth muscle lining
    the bronchus and bronchioles, and increases the secretions from glands. \n\nThe
    lungs also have a sympathetic tone from norepinephrine acting on the beta 2 adrenoceptors
    in the respiratory tract, which causes bronchodilation.The action of breathing
    takes place because of nerve signals sent by the respiratory center in the brainstem,
    along the phrenic nerve from the cervical plexus to the diaphragm.\n\n\n=== Variation
    ===\n\nThe lobes of the lung are subject to anatomical variations. \n\nA horizontal
    interlobar fissure was found to be incomplete in 25% of right lungs, or even
    absent in 11% of all cases. \n\nAn accessory fissure was also found in 14% and
    22% of left and right lungs, respectively. \n\nAn oblique fissure was found to
    be incomplete in 21% to 47% of left lungs. \n\nIn some cases a fissure is absent,
    or extra, resulting in a right lung with only two lobes, or a left lung with
    three lobes.A variation in the airway branching structure has been found specifically
    in the central airway\nbranching. \n\nThis variation is associated with the development
    of COPD in adulthood.\n\n\n== Development ==\n\n\nThe development of the human
    lungs arise from the laryngotracheal groove and develop to maturity over several
    weeks in the foetus and for several years following birth.The larynx, trachea,
    bronchi and lungs that make up the respiratory tract, begin to form during the
    fourth week of embryogenesis from the lung bud which appears ventrally to the
    caudal portion of the foregut.\n\nThe respiratory tract has a branching structure,
    and is also known as the respiratory tree. \n\nIn the embryo this structure is
    developed in the process of branching morphogenesis, and is generated by the
    repeated splitting of the tip of the branch. \n\nIn the development of the lungs
    (as in some other organs) the epithelium forms branching tubes. \n\nThe lung
    has a left-right symmetry and each bud known as a bronchial bud grows out as
    a tubular epithelium that becomes a bronchus. \n\nEach bronchus branches into
    bronchioles. \n\nThe branching is a result of the tip of each tube bifurcating.
    \n\nThe branching process forms the bronchi, bronchioles, and ultimately the
    alveoli. \n\nThe four genes mostly associated with branching morphogenesis in
    the lung are the intercellular signalling protein \u2013 sonic hedgehog (SHH),
    fibroblast growth factors FGF10 and FGFR2b, and bone morphogenetic protein BMP4.
    \n\nFGF10 is seen to have the most prominent role. \n\nFGF10 is a paracrine signalling
    molecule needed for epithelial branching, and SHH inhibits FGF10. \n\nThe development
    of the alveoli is influenced by a different mechanism whereby continued bifurcation
    is stopped and the distal tips become dilated to form the alveoli.\nAt the end
    of the fourth week the lung bud divides into two, the right and left primary
    bronchial buds on each side of the trachea. \n\nDuring the fifth week the right
    bud branches into three secondary bronchial buds and the left branches into two
    secondary bronchial buds. \n\nThese give rise to the lobes of the lungs, three
    on the right and two on the left. \n\nOver the following week, the secondary
    buds branch into tertiary buds, about ten on each side. \n\nFrom the sixth week
    to the sixteenth week, the major elements of the lungs appear except the alveoli.
    \n\nFrom week 16 to week 26, the bronchi enlarge and lung tissue becomes highly
    vascularised. \n\nBronchioles and alveolar ducts also develop. \n\nBy week 26
    the terminal bronchioles have formed which branch into two respiratory bronchioles.
    \n\nDuring the period covering the 26th week until birth the important blood\u2013air
    barrier is established. \n\nSpecialised type I alveolar cells where gas exchange
    will take place, together with the type II alveolar cells that secrete pulmonary
    surfactant, appear. \n\nThe surfactant reduces the surface tension at the air-alveolar
    surface which allows expansion of the alveolar sacs. \n\nThe alveolar sacs contain
    the primitive alveoli that form at the end of the alveolar ducts,\nand their
    appearance around the seventh month marks the point at which limited respiration
    would be possible, and the premature baby could survive.\n\n\n=== Vitamin A deficiency
    ===\n\n\nThe developing lung is particularly vulnerable to changes in the levels
    of vitamin A. \n\nVitamin A deficiency has been linked to changes in the epithelial
    lining of the lung and in the lung parenchyma. \n\nThis can disrupt the normal
    physiology of the lung and predispose to respiratory diseases. \n\nSevere nutritional
    deficiency in vitamin A results in a reduction in the formation of the alveolar
    walls (septa) and to notable changes in the respiratory epithelium; alterations
    are noted in the extracellular matrix and in the protein content of the basement
    membrane. \n\nThe extracellular matrix maintains lung elasticity; the basement
    membrane is associated with alveolar epithelium and is important in the blood-air
    barrier. \n\nThe deficiency is associated with functional defects and disease
    states. \n\nVitamin A is crucial in the development of the alveoli which continues
    for several years after birth.\n\n\n=== After birth ===\n\nAt birth, the baby's
    lungs are filled with fluid secreted by the lungs and are not inflated. \n\nAfter
    birth the infant's central nervous system reacts to the sudden change in temperature
    and environment. \n\nThis triggers the first breath, within about 10 seconds
    after delivery. \n\nBefore birth, the lungs are filled with fetal lung fluid.  
    After the first breath, the fluid is quickly absorbed into the body or exhaled.
    \n\nThe resistance in the lung's blood vessels decreases giving an increased
    surface area for gas exchange, and the lungs begin to breathe spontaneously.
    \n\nThis accompanies other changes which result in an increased amount of blood
    entering the lung tissues.At birth the lungs are very undeveloped with only around
    one sixth of the alveoli of the adult lung present. \n\nThe alveoli continue
    to form into early adulthood, and their ability to form when necessary is seen
    in the regeneration of the lung. \n\nAlveolar septa have a double capillary network
    instead of the single network of the developed lung. \n\nOnly after the maturation
    of the capillary network can the lung enter a normal phase of growth. \n\nFollowing
    the early growth in numbers of alveoli there is another stage of the alveoli
    being enlarged.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\n\n\n=== Gas exchange ===\n\nThe major
    function of the lungs is gas exchange between the lungs and the blood. \n\nThe
    alveolar and pulmonary capillary gases equilibrate across the thin blood\u2013air
    barrier. \n\nThis thin membrane (about 0.5 \u20132 \u03BCm thick) is folded into
    about 300 million alveoli, providing an extremely large surface area (estimates
    varying between 70 and 145 m2) for gas exchange to occur.\n\nThe lungs are not
    capable of expanding to breathe on their own, and will only do so when there
    is an increase in the volume of the thoracic cavity. \n\nThis is achieved by
    the muscles of respiration, through the contraction of the diaphragm, and the
    intercostal muscles which pull the rib cage upwards as shown in the diagram.
    \n\nDuring breathing out the muscles relax, returning the lungs to their resting
    position. \n\nAt this point the lungs contain the functional residual capacity
    (FRC) of air, which, in the adult human, has a volume of about 2.5\u20133.0 litres.During
    heavy breathing as in exertion, a large number of accessory muscles in the neck
    and abdomen are recruited, that during exhalation pull the ribcage down, decreasing
    the volume of the thoracic cavity. \n\nThe FRC is now decreased, but since the
    lungs cannot be emptied completely there is still about a litre of residual air
    left. \n\nLung function testing is carried out to evaluate lung volumes and capacities.\n\n\n===
    Protection ===\n\nThe lungs possess several characteristics which protect against
    infection. \n\nThe respiratory tract is lined by respiratory epithelium or respiratory
    mucosa, with hair-like projections called cilia that beat rhythmically and carry
    mucus. \n\nThis mucociliary clearance is an important defence system against
    air-borne infection. \n\nThe dust particles and bacteria in the inhaled air are
    caught in the mucosal surface of the airways, and are moved up towards the pharynx
    by the rhythmic upward beating action of the cilia.:\u200A661\u2013730\u200A
    The lining of the lung also secretes immunoglobulin A which protects against
    respiratory infections; goblet cells secrete mucus which also contains several
    antimicrobial compounds such as defensins, antiproteases, and antioxidants. \n\nA
    rare type of specialised cell called a pulmonary ionocyte that is suggested may
    regulate mucus viscosity has been described. \n\nIn addition, the lining of the
    lung also contains macrophages, immune cells which engulf and destroy debris
    and microbes that enter the lung in a process known as phagocytosis; and dendritic
    cells which present antigens to activate components of the adaptive immune system
    such as T cells and B cells.The size of the respiratory tract and the flow of
    air also protect the lungs from larger particles. \n\nSmaller particles deposit
    in the mouth and behind the mouth in the oropharynx, and larger particles are
    trapped in nasal hair after inhalation.\n\n\n=== Other ===\n\nIn addition to
    their function in respiration, the lungs have a number of other functions. \n\nThey
    are involved in maintaining homeostasis, helping in the regulation of blood pressure
    as part of the renin\u2013angiotensin system. \n\nThe inner lining of the blood
    vessels secretes angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) an enzyme that catalyses
    the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. \n\nThe lungs are involved
    in the blood's acid\u2013base homeostasis by expelling carbon dioxide when breathing.The
    lungs also serve a protective role. \n\nSeveral blood-borne substances, such
    as a few types of prostaglandins, leukotrienes, serotonin and bradykinin, are
    excreted through the lungs. \n\nDrugs and other substances can be absorbed, modified
    or excreted in the lungs. \n\nThe lungs filter out small blood clots from veins
    and prevent them from entering arteries and causing strokes.The lungs also play
    a pivotal role in speech by providing air and airflow for the creation of vocal
    sounds, and other paralanguage communications such as sighs and gasps.\nResearch
    suggests a role of the lungs in the production of blood platelets.\n\n\n== Gene
    and protein expression ==\n\n\nAbout 20,000 protein coding genes are expressed
    in human cells and almost 75% of these genes are expressed in the normal lung.
    \n\nA little less than 200 of these genes are more specifically expressed in
    the lung with less than 20 genes being highly lung specific. \n\nThe highest
    expression of lung specific proteins are different surfactant proteins, such
    as SFTPA1, SFTPB and SFTPC, and napsin, expressed in type II pneumocytes. \n\nOther
    proteins with elevated expression in the lung are the dynein protein DNAH5 in
    ciliated cells, and the secreted SCGB1A1 protein in mucus-secreting goblet cells
    of the airway mucosa.\n\n\n== Clinical significance ==\n\n\nLungs can be affected
    by a number of diseases and disorders. \n\nPulmonology is the medical speciality
    that deals with respiratory diseases involving the lungs and respiratory system.
    \n\nCardiothoracic surgery deals with surgery of the lungs including lung volume
    reduction surgery, lobectomy, pneumectomy and lung transplantation.\n\n\n===
    Inflammation and infection ===\n\nInflammatory conditions of the lung tissue
    are pneumonia, of the respiratory tract are bronchitis and bronchiolitis, and
    of the pleurae surrounding the lungs pleurisy. \n\nInflammation is usually caused
    by infections due to bacteria or viruses. \n\nWhen the lung tissue is inflamed
    due to other causes it is called pneumonitis. \n\nOne major cause of bacterial
    pneumonia is tuberculosis. \n\nChronic infections often occur in those with immunodeficiency
    and can include a fungal infection by Aspergillus fumigatus that can lead to
    an aspergilloma forming in the lung.Alcohol affects the lungs and can cause inflammatory
    alcoholic lung disease. \n\nAcute exposure to alcohol stimulates the beating
    of cilia in the respiratory epithelium. \n\nHowever, chronic exposure has the
    effect of desensitising the ciliary response which reduces mucociliary clearance
    (MCC). \n\nMCC is an innate defense system protecting against pollutants and
    pathogens, and when this is disrupted the numbers of alveolar macrophages are
    decreased. \n\nA subsequent inflammatory response is the release of cytokines.
    \n\nAnother consequence is the susceptibility to infection.\n\n\n=== Blood-supply
    changes ===\n\n\nA pulmonary embolism is a blood clot that becomes lodged in
    the pulmonary arteries. \n\nThe majority of emboli arise because of deep vein
    thrombosis in the legs. \n\nPulmonary emboli may be investigated using a ventilation/perfusion
    scan, a CT scan of the arteries of the lung, or blood tests such as the D-dimer.
    \n\nPulmonary hypertension describes an increased pressure at the beginning of
    the pulmonary artery that has a large number of differing causes. \n\nOther rarer
    conditions may also affect the blood supply of the lung, such as granulomatosis
    with polyangiitis, which causes inflammation of the small blood vessels of the
    lungs and kidneys.A lung contusion is a bruise caused by chest trauma. \n\nIt
    results in hemorrhage of the alveoli causing a build-up of fluid which can impair
    breathing, and this can be either mild or severe.\nThe function of the lungs
    can also be affected by compression from fluid in the pleural cavity pleural
    effusion, or other substances such as air (pneumothorax), blood (hemothorax),
    or rarer causes. \n\nThese may be investigated using a chest X-ray or CT scan,
    and may require the insertion of a surgical drain until the underlying cause
    is identified and treated.\n\n\n=== Obstructive lung diseases ===\n\n\nAsthma,
    chronic bronchitis, bronchiectasis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
    (COPD) are all obstructive lung diseases characterised by airway obstruction.
    \n\nThis limits the amount of air that is able to enter alveoli because of constriction
    of the bronchial tree, due to inflammation. \n\nObstructive lung diseases are
    often identified because of symptoms and diagnosed with pulmonary function tests
    such as spirometry. \n\nMany obstructive lung diseases are managed by avoiding
    triggers (such as dust mites or smoking), with symptom control such as bronchodilators,
    and with suppression of inflammation (such as through corticosteroids) in severe
    cases. \n\nA common cause of chronic bronchitis, and emphysema, is smoking; and
    common causes of bronchiectasis include severe infections and cystic fibrosis.
    \n\nThe definitive cause of asthma is not yet known.The breakdown of alveolar
    tissue, often as a result of tobacco-smoking leads to emphysema, which can become
    severe enough to develop into COPD. \n\nElastase breaks down the elastin in the
    lung's connective tissue that can also result in emphysema. \n\nElastase is inhibited
    by the acute-phase protein, alpha-1 antitrypsin, and when there is a deficiency
    in this, emphysema can develop. \n\nWith persistent stress from smoking, the
    airway basal cells become disarranged and lose their regenerative ability needed
    to repair the epithelial barrier. \n\nThe disorganised basal cells are seen to
    be responsible for the major airway changes that are characteristic of COPD,
    and with continued stress can undergo a malignant transformation. \n\nStudies
    have shown that the initial development of emphysema is centred on the early
    changes in the airway epithelium of the small airways. \n\nBasal cells become
    further deranged in a smoker's transition to clinically defined COPD.\n\n\n===
    Restrictive lung diseases ===\n\nSome types of chronic lung diseases are classified
    as restrictive lung disease, because of a restriction in the amount of lung tissue
    involved in respiration. \n\nThese include pulmonary fibrosis which can occur
    when the lung is inflamed for a long period of time. \n\nFibrosis in the lung
    replaces functioning lung tissue with fibrous connective tissue. \n\nThis can
    be due to a large variety of occupational lung diseases such as Coalworker's
    pneumoconiosis, autoimmune diseases or more rarely to a reaction to medication.
    \n\nSevere respiratory disorders, where spontaneous breathing is not enough to
    maintain life, may need the use of mechanical ventilation to ensure an adequate
    supply of air.\n\n\n=== Cancers ===\n\nLung cancer can either arise directly
    from lung tissue or as a result of metastasis from another part of the body.
    \n\nThere are two main types of primary tumour described as either small-cell
    or non-small-cell lung carcinomas. \n\nThe major risk factor for cancer is smoking.
    \n\nOnce a cancer is identified it is staged using scans such as a CT scan and
    a sample of tissue from a biopsy is taken. \n\nCancers may be treated surgically
    by removing the tumour, the use of radiotherapy, chemotherapy or a combination,
    or with the aim of symptom control. \n\nLung cancer screening is being recommended
    in the United States for high-risk populations.\n\n\n=== Congenital disorders
    ===\n\nCongenital disorders include cystic fibrosis, pulmonary hypoplasia (an
    incomplete development of the lungs)congenital diaphragmatic hernia, and infant
    respiratory distress syndrome caused by a deficiency in lung surfactant. \n\nAn
    azygos lobe is a congenital anatomical variation which though usually without
    effect can cause problems in thoracoscopic procedures.\n\n\n=== Others ===\n\nA
    pneumothorax (collapsed lung) is an abnormal collection of air in the pleural
    space that causes an uncoupling of the lung from the chest wall. \n\nThe lung
    cannot expand against the air pressure inside the pleural space. \n\nAn easy
    to understand example is a traumatic pneumothorax, where air enters the pleural
    space from outside the body, as occurs with puncture to the chest wall. \n\nSimilarly,
    scuba divers ascending while holding their breath with their lungs fully inflated
    can cause air sacs (alveoli) to burst and leak high pressure air into the pleural
    space.\n\n\n=== Lung examination ===\n\n\nAs part of a physical examination in
    response to respiratory symptoms of shortness of breath, and cough, a lung examination
    may be carried out. \n\nThis exam includes palpation and auscultation. \n\nThe
    areas of the lungs that can be listened to using a stethoscope are called the
    lung fields, and these are the posterior, lateral, and anterior lung fields.
    \n\nThe posterior fields can be listened to from the back and include: the lower
    lobes (taking up three quarters of the posterior fields); the anterior fields
    taking up the other quarter; and the lateral fields under the axillae, the left
    axilla for the lingual, the right axilla for the middle right lobe. \n\nThe anterior
    fields can also be auscultated from the front. \n\nAbnormal breathing sounds
    heard during a lung exam can indicate the presence of a lung condition; wheezing
    for example is commonly associated with asthma and COPD.\n\n\n=== Lung function
    testing ===\n\n\nLung function testing is carried out by evaluating a person's
    capacity to inhale and exhale in different circumstances. \n\nThe volume of air
    inhaled and exhaled by a person at rest is the tidal volume (normally 500-750mL);
    the inspiratory reserve volume and expiratory reserve volume are the additional
    amounts a person is able to forcibly inhale and exhale respectively. \n\nThe
    summed total of forced inspiration and expiration is a person's vital capacity.
    \n\nNot all air is expelled from the lungs even after a forced breath out; the
    remainder of the air is called the residual volume. \n\nTogether these terms
    are referred to as lung volumes.Pulmonary plethysmographs are used to measure
    functional residual capacity. \n\nFunctional residual capacity cannot be measured
    by tests that rely on breathing out, as a person is only able to breathe a maximum
    of 80% of their total functional capacity. \n\nThe total lung capacity depends
    on the person's age, height, weight, and sex, and normally ranges between 4 and
    6 litres. \n\nFemales tend to have a 20\u201325% lower capacity than males. \n\nTall
    people tend to have a larger total lung capacity than shorter people. \n\nSmokers
    have a lower capacity than nonsmokers. \n\nThinner persons tend to have a larger
    capacity. \n\nLung capacity can be increased by physical training as much as
    40% but the effect may be modified by exposure to air pollution.Other lung function
    tests include spirometry, measuring the amount (volume) and flow of air that
    can be inhaled and exhaled. \n\nThe maximum volume of breath that can be exhaled
    is called the vital capacity. \n\nIn particular, how much a person is able to
    exhale in one second (called forced expiratory volume (FEV1)) as a proportion
    of how much they are able to exhale in total (FEV). \n\nThis ratio, the FEV1/FEV
    ratio, is important to distinguish whether a lung disease is restrictive or obstructive.
    \n\nAnother test is that of the lung's diffusing capacity \u2013 this is a measure
    of the transfer of gas from air to the blood in the lung capillaries.\n\n\n==
    Other animals ==\n\n\n\n=== Birds ===\n\n\n \nThe lungs of birds are relatively
    small, but are connected to 8 or 9 air sacs that extend through much of the body,
    and are in turn connected to air spaces within the bones. \n\nOn inhalation,
    air travels through the trachea of a bird into the air sacs. \n\nAir then travels
    continuously from the air sacs at the back, through the lungs, which are relatively
    fixed in size, to the air sacs at the front. \n\nFrom here, the air is exhaled.
    \n\nThese fixed size lungs are called \"circulatory lungs\", as distinct from
    the \"bellows-type lungs\" found in most other animals.The lungs of birds contain
    millions of tiny parallel passages called parabronchi. \n\nSmall sacs called
    atria radiate from the walls of the tiny passages; these, like the alveoli in
    other lungs, are the site of gas exchange by simple diffusion. \n\nThe blood
    flow around the parabronchi and their atria forms a cross-current process of
    gas exchange (see diagram on the right).The air sacs, which hold air, do not
    contribute much to gas exchange, despite being thin-walled, as they are poorly
    vascularised. \n\nThe air sacs expand and contract due to changes in the volume
    in the thorax and abdomen. \n\nThis volume change is caused by the movement of
    the sternum and ribs and this movement is often synchronised with movement of
    the flight muscles.Parabronchi in which the air flow is unidirectional are called
    paleopulmonic parabronchi and are found in all birds. \n\nSome birds, however,
    have, in addition, a lung structure where the air flow in the parabronchi is
    bidirectional. \n\nThese are termed neopulmonic parabronchi.\n\n\n=== Reptiles
    ===\n\n\nThe lungs of most reptiles have a single bronchus running down the centre,
    from which numerous branches reach out to individual pockets throughout the lungs.
    \n\nThese pockets are similar to alveoli in mammals, but much larger and fewer
    in number. \n\nThese give the lung a sponge-like texture. \n\nIn tuataras, snakes,
    and some lizards, the lungs are simpler in structure, similar to that of typical
    amphibians.Snakes and limbless lizards typically possess only the right lung
    as a major respiratory organ; the left lung is greatly reduced, or even absent.
    \n\nAmphisbaenians, however, have the opposite arrangement, with a major left
    lung, and a reduced or absent right lung.Both crocodilians and monitor lizards
    have developed lungs similar to those of birds, providing a unidirectional airflow
    and even possessing air sacs. \n\nThe now extinct pterosaurs have seemingly even
    further refined this type of lung, extending the airsacs into the wing membranes
    and, in the case of lonchodectids, tupuxuara, and azhdarchoids, the hindlimbs.Reptilian
    lungs typically receive air via expansion and contraction of the ribs driven
    by axial muscles and buccal pumping. \n\nCrocodilians also rely on the hepatic
    piston method, in which the liver is pulled back by a muscle anchored to the
    pubic bone (part of the pelvis) called the diaphragmaticus, which in turn creates
    negative pressure in the crocodile's thoracic cavity, allowing air to be moved
    into the lungs by Boyle's law. \n\nTurtles, which are unable to move their ribs,
    instead use their forelimbs and pectoral girdle to force air in and out of the
    lungs.\n\n\n=== Amphibians ===\n\n\nThe lungs of most frogs and other amphibians
    are simple and balloon-like, with gas exchange limited to the outer surface of
    the lung. \n\nThis is not very efficient, but amphibians have low metabolic demands
    and can also quickly dispose of carbon dioxide by diffusion across their skin
    in water, and supplement their oxygen supply by the same method. \n\nAmphibians
    employ a positive pressure system to get air to their lungs, forcing air down
    into the lungs by buccal pumping. \n\nThis is distinct from most higher vertebrates,
    who use a breathing system driven by negative pressure where the lungs are inflated
    by expanding the rib cage. \n\nIn buccal pumping, the floor of the mouth is lowered,
    filling the mouth cavity with air. \n\nThe throat muscles then presses the throat
    against the underside of the skull, forcing the air into the lungs.Due to the
    possibility of respiration across the skin combined with small size, all known
    lungless tetrapods are amphibians. \n\nThe majority of salamander species are
    lungless salamanders, which respirate through their skin and tissues lining their
    mouth. \n\nThis necessarily restricts their size: all are small and rather thread-like
    in appearance, maximising skin surface relative to body volume. \n\nOther known
    lungless tetrapods are the Bornean flat-headed frog and Atretochoana eiselti,
    a caecilian.The lungs of amphibians typically have a few narrow internal walls
    (septa) of soft tissue around the outer walls, increasing the respiratory surface
    area and giving the lung a honeycomb appearance. \n\nIn some salamanders even
    these are lacking, and the lung has a smooth wall. \n\nIn caecilians, as in snakes,
    only the right lung attains any size or development.\n\n\n=== Lungfish ===\n\nThe
    lungs of lungfish are similar to those of amphibians, with few, if any, internal
    septa. \n\nIn the Australian lungfish, there is only a single lung, albeit divided
    into two lobes. \n\nOther lungfish and Polypterus, however, have two lungs, which
    are located in the upper part of the body, with the connecting duct curving around
    and above the esophagus. \n\nThe blood supply also twists around the esophagus,
    suggesting that the lungs originally evolved in the ventral part of the body,
    as in other vertebrates.\n\n\n=== Invertebrates ===\n\n\nSome invertebrates have
    lung-like structures that serve a similar respiratory purpose as, but are not
    evolutionarily related to, vertebrate lungs. \n\nSome arachnids, such as spiders
    and scorpions, have structures called book lungs used for atmospheric gas exchange.
    \n\nSome species of spider have four pairs of book lungs but most have two pairs.
    \n\nScorpions have spiracles on their body for the entrance of air to the book
    lungs.The coconut crab is terrestrial and uses structures called branchiostegal
    lungs to breathe air. \n\nThey cannot swim and would drown in water, yet they
    possess a rudimentary set of gills. \n\nThey can breathe on land and hold their
    breath underwater. \n\nThe branchiostegal lungs are seen as a developmental adaptive
    stage from water-living to enable land-living, or from fish to amphibian.Pulmonates
    are mostly land snails and slugs that have developed a simple lung from the mantle
    cavity. \n\nAn externally located opening called the pneumostome allows air to
    be taken into the mantle cavity lung.\n\n\n== Evolutionary origins ==\n\nThe
    lungs of today's terrestrial vertebrates and the gas bladders of today's fish
    are believed to have evolved from simple sacs, as outpocketings of the esophagus,
    that allowed early fish to gulp air under oxygen-poor conditions. \n\nThese outpocketings
    first arose in the bony fish. \n\nIn most of the ray-finned fish the sacs evolved
    into closed off gas bladders, while a number of carp, trout, herring, catfish,
    and eels have retained the physostome condition with the sac being open to the
    esophagus. \n\nIn more basal bony fish, such as the gar, bichir, bowfin and the
    lobe-finned fish, the bladders have evolved to primarily function as lungs. \n\nThe
    lobe-finned fish gave rise to the land-based tetrapods. \n\nThus, the lungs of
    vertebrates are homologous to the gas bladders of fish (but not to their gills).\n\n\n==

  descriptionText: "\n\nSUBMANDIBULAR GLAND\n\n\nThe paired submandibular glands
    (historically known as submaxillary glands) are major salivary glands located
    beneath the floor of the mouth. \n\nThey each weigh about 15 grams and contribute
    some 60\u201367% of unstimulated saliva secretion; on stimulation their contribution
    decreases in proportion as the parotid secretion rises to 50%. \n\nThe average
    length of the normal human submandibular salivary gland is approximately 27mm,
    while the average width is approximately 14.3mm.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\n\nLying
    superior to the digastric muscles, each submandibular gland is divided into superficial
    and deep lobes, which are separated by the mylohyoid muscle:\nThe superficial
    lobe comprises most of the gland, with the mylohyoid muscle runs under it\nThe
    deep lobe is the smaller partSecretions are delivered into the submandibular
    duct on the deep portion after which they hook around the posterior edge of the
    mylohyoid muscle and proceed on the superior surface laterally. \n\nThe excretory
    ducts are then crossed by the lingual nerve, and ultimately drain into the sublingual
    caruncles \u2013 small prominences on either side of the lingual frenulum along
    with the major sublingual duct. \n\nThe gland can be bilaterally palpated (felt)
    inferior and posterior to the body of the mandible, moving inward from the inferior
    border of the mandible near its angle with the head tilted forwards.\n\n\n===
    Microanatomy ===\n\n\nLobes contain smaller lobules, which contain adenomeres,
    the secretory units of the gland. \n\nEach adenomer contains one or more acini,
    or alveoli, which are small clusters of cells that secrete their products into
    a duct. \n\nThe acini of each adenomere are composed of either serous or mucous
    cells, with serous adenomeres predominating. \n\nSome mucous adenomeres may also
    be capped with a serous demilune, a layer of lysozyme-secreting serous cells
    resembling a half moon.\nLike other exocrine glands, the submandibular gland
    can be classified by the microscopic anatomy of its secretory cells and how they
    are arranged. \n\nBecause the glands are branched, and because the tubules forming
    the branches contain secretory cells, submandibular glands are classified as
    branched tubuloacinar glands. \n\nFurther, because the secretory cells are of
    both serous and mucous types, the submandibular gland is a mixed gland, and though
    most of the cells are serous, the exudate is chiefly mucous. \n\nIt has long
    striated ducts and short intercalated ducts.The secretory acinar cells of the
    submandibular gland have distinct functions. \n\nThe mucous cells are the most
    active and therefore the major product of the submandibular glands is saliva
    which is mucoid in nature. \n\nMucous cells secrete mucin which aids in the lubrication
    of the food bolus as it travels through the esophagus. \n\nIn addition, the serous
    cells produce salivary amylase, which aids in the breakdown of starches in the
    mouth. \n\nThe submandibular gland's highly active acini account for most of
    the salivary volume. \n\nThe parotid and sublingual glands account for the remaining.\n\n\n===
    Blood supply ===\n\nThe gland receives its blood supply from the facial and lingual
    arteries. \n\nThe gland is supplied by sublingual and submental arteries and
    drained by common facial and lingual veins.\n\n\n=== Lymphatic drainage ===\n\nThe
    lymphatics from submandibular gland first drain into submandibular lymph nodes
    and subsequently into jugulo - digastric lymph nodes.\n\n\n=== Nerve supply ===\n\n\nTheir
    secretions, like the secretions of other salivary glands, are regulated directly
    by the parasympathetic nervous system and indirectly by the sympathetic nervous
    system.\n\nParasympathetic innervation to the submandibular glands is provided
    by the superior salivatory nucleus via the chorda tympani, a branch of the facial
    nerve, that becomes part of the trigeminal nerve's lingual nerve prior to synapsing
    on the submandibular ganglion. \n\nIncreased parasympathetic activity promotes
    the secretion of saliva.\nThe sympathetic nervous system regulates submandibular
    secretions through vasoconstriction of the arteries that supply it. \n\nIncreased
    sympathetic activity reduces glandular bloodflow, thereby decreasing the volume
    of fluid in salivary secretions, producing an enzyme rich mucous saliva. \n\nNevertheless,
    direct stimulation of sympathetic nerves will cause an increase in salivary enzymatic
    secretions. \n\nIn sum, the volume decreases, but the secretions are increased
    by parasympathetic and sympathetic innervation.\n\n\n=== Development ===\n\nThe
    submandibular salivary glands develop later than the parotid glands and appear
    late in the sixth week of prenatal development. \n\nThey develop bilaterally
    from epithelial buds in the sulcus surrounding the sublingual folds on the floor
    of the primitive mouth. \n\nSolid cords branch from the buds and grow posteriorly,
    lateral to the developing tongue. \n\nThe cords of the submandibular gland later
    branch further and then become canalized to form the ductal part. \n\nThe submandibular
    gland acini develop from the cords\u2019 rounded terminal ends at 12 weeks, and
    secretory activity via the submandibular duct begins at 16 weeks. \n\nGrowth
    of the submandibular gland continues after birth with the formation of more acini.
    \n\nLateral to both sides of the tongue, a linear groove develops and closes
    over to form the submandibular duct.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\nThe submandibular
    gland releases a host of factors which regulate systemic inflammatory responses
    and modulate systemic immune and inflammatory reactions. \n\nEarly work in identifying
    factors that played a role in the cervical sympathetic trunk-submandibular gland
    (CST-SMG) axis lead to the discovery of a seven amino acid peptide, called the
    submandibular gland peptide-T. \n\nSGP-T was demonstrated to have biological
    activity and thermoregulatory properties related to endotoxin exposure. \n\nSGP-T,
    an isolate of the submandibular gland, demonstrated its immunoregulatory properties
    and potential role in modulating the CST-SMG axis, and subsequently was shown
    to play an important role in the control of inflammation. \n\n\n== Clinical significance
    ==\n\n\nThe submandibular gland accounts for 80% of all salivary duct calculi
    (salivary stones or sialolith), possibly due to the different nature of the saliva
    that it produces and the tortuous travel of the submandibular duct to its ductal
    opening for a considerable upward distance. \n\nThe submandibular gland is one
    of the major three glands that provide the mouth with saliva. \n\nThe\ntwo other
    types of salivary glands are parotid and sublingual glands.\n\n\n=== Dissection

  descriptionText: "\n\nLESSER OMENTUM\n\n\nThe lesser omentum (small omentum or
    gastrohepatic omentum) is the double layer of peritoneum that extends from the
    liver to the lesser curvature of the stomach, and to the first part of the duodenum.
    \n\nThe lesser omentum is usually divided into these two connecting parts: the
    hepatogastric ligament, and the hepatoduodenal ligament.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\n\nThe
    lesser omentum is extremely thin, and is continuous with the two layers of peritoneum
    which cover respectively the antero-superior and postero-inferior surfaces of
    the stomach and first part of the duodenum.\nWhen these two layers reach the
    lesser curvature of the stomach and the upper border of the duodenum, they join
    together and ascend as a double fold to the porta hepatis.\nTo the left of the
    porta, the fold is attached to the bottom of the fossa for the ductus venosus,
    along which it is carried to the diaphragm, where the two layers separate to
    embrace the end of the esophagus.\nAt the right border of the lesser omentum,
    the two layers are continuous, and form a free margin which constitutes the anterior
    boundary of the omental foramen.\n\n\n== Divisions ==\n\nAnatomically, the lesser
    omentum is divided into ligaments, each starting with the prefix \"hepato\" to
    indicate that it connects to the liver at one end.\nMost sources divide it into
    two parts:\nhepatogastric ligament: the portion connecting to the lesser curvature
    of the stomach\nhepatoduodenal ligament: the portion connecting to the duodenumIn
    some cases, the following ligaments are considered part of the lesser omentum:\n\nhepatophrenic
    ligament: the portion connecting to the thoracic diaphragm\nhepatoesophageal
    ligament: the portion connecting to the esophagus\nhepatocolic ligament: the
    portion connecting to the colon\n\n\n== Contents ==\n\nBetween the two layers
    of the lesser omentum, close to the right free margin, are the hepatic artery
    proper, the common bile duct, the portal vein, lymphatics, and the hepatic plexus
    of nerves\u2014all these structures being enclosed in a fibrous capsule (Glisson's
    capsule).\nBetween the layers of the lesser omentum, where they are attached
    to the stomach, run the right and left gastric arteries, as well as the gastric
    veins.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesser_omentum"

  descriptionText: "\n\nTHYROID GLAND\n\n\nThe thyroid, or thyroid gland, is an endocrine
    gland in vertebrates. \n\nIn humans it is in the neck and consists of two connected
    lobes. \n\nThe lower two thirds of the lobes are connected by a thin band of
    tissue called the thyroid isthmus. \n\nThe thyroid is located at the front of
    the neck, below the Adam's apple. \n\nMicroscopically, the functional unit of
    the thyroid gland is the spherical thyroid follicle, lined with follicular cells
    (thyrocytes), and occasional parafollicular cells that surround a lumen containing
    colloid. \n\nThe thyroid gland secretes three hormones: the two thyroid hormones
    \u2013 triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) \u2013 and a peptide hormone,
    calcitonin. \n\nThe thyroid hormones influence the metabolic rate and protein
    synthesis, and in children, growth and development. \n\nCalcitonin plays a role
    in calcium homeostasis. \n\nSecretion of the two thyroid hormones is regulated
    by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), which is secreted from the anterior pituitary
    gland. \n\nTSH is regulated by thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), which is
    produced by the hypothalamus.\n\nThe thyroid gland develops in the floor of the
    pharynx at the base of the tongue at 3\u20134 weeks gestation; it then descends
    in front of the pharyngeal gut, and ultimately over the next few weeks, it migrates
    to the base of the neck. \n\nDuring migration, the thyroid remains connected
    to the tongue by a narrow canal, the thyroglossal duct. \n\nAt the end of the
    fifth week the thyroglossal duct degenerates, and over the following two weeks
    the detached thyroid migrates to its final position.\n\nEuthyroid is the term
    used to describe a state of normal thyroid function in the body. \n\nThyroid
    disorders include hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, thyroid inflammation (thyroiditis),
    thyroid enlargement (goitre), thyroid nodules, and thyroid cancer. \n\nHyperthyroidism
    is characterized by excessive secretion of thyroid hormones: the most common
    cause is the autoimmune disorder Graves' disease. \n\nHypothyroidism is characterized
    by a deficient secretion of thyroid hormones: the most common cause is iodine
    deficiency. \n\nIn iodine-deficient regions, hypothyroidism secondary to iodine
    deficiency is the leading cause of preventable intellectual disability in children.
    \n\nIn iodine-sufficient regions, the most common cause of hypothyroidism is
    the autoimmune disorder Hashimoto's thyroiditis. \n\nThe presence of the thyroid
    and its various diseases have been noted and treated for centuries, although
    the gland itself has only been described and named since the Renaissance. \n\nKnowledge
    of the thyroid, its biochemistry, and its disorders developed throughout the
    late nineteenth and twentieth centuries. \n\nMany modern treatments and investigative
    modalities evolved throughout the mid-twentieth century, including refinement
    of surgical techniques for thyroid removal (thyroidectomy) for the treatment
    of goitre; the use of radioactive iodine and thiouracil for the treatment of
    Graves' disease; and fine needle aspiration for diagnosis of thyroid nodules.\n\n\n==
    Structure ==\n\n=== Features ===\n\nThe thyroid gland is a butterfly-shaped organ
    composed of two lobes, left and right, connected by a narrow tissue band, called
    an \"isthmus\". \n\nIt weighs 25 grams in adults, with each lobe being about
    5 cm long, 3 cm wide, and 2 cm thick and the isthmus about 1.25 cm in height
    and width. \n\nThe gland is usually larger in women than in men, and increases
    in size during pregnancy.\n\nThe thyroid is near the front of the neck, lying
    against and around the front of the larynx and trachea. \n\nThe thyroid cartilage
    and cricoid cartilage lie just above the gland, below the Adam's apple. \n\nThe
    isthmus extends from the second to third rings of the trachea, with the uppermost
    part of the lobes extending to the thyroid cartilage and the lowermost around
    the fourth to sixth tracheal rings. \n\nThe infrahyoid muscles lie in front of
    the gland and the sternocleidomastoid muscle to the side. \n\nBehind the outer
    wings of the thyroid lie the two carotid arteries. \n\nThe trachea, larynx, lower
    pharynx and esophagus all lie behind the thyroid. \n\nIn this region, the recurrent
    laryngeal nerve and the inferior thyroid artery pass next to or in the ligament.
    \n\nTypically, four parathyroid glands, two on each side, lie on each side between
    the two layers of the thyroid capsule, at the back of the thyroid lobes.\n\nThe
    thyroid gland is covered by a thin fibrous capsule, which has an inner and an
    outer layer. \n\nThe inner layer extrudes into the gland and forms the septae
    that divides the thyroid tissue into microscopic lobules. \n\nThe outer layer
    is continuous with the pretracheal fascia, attaching the gland to the cricoid
    and thyroid cartilages via a thickening of the fascia to form the posterior suspensory
    ligament of thyroid gland, also known as Berry's ligament. \n\nThis causes the
    thyroid to move up and down with the movement of these cartilages when swallowing
    occurs.\n\n\n=== Blood, lymph and nerve supply ===\n\nThe thyroid is supplied
    with arterial blood from the superior thyroid artery, a branch of the external
    carotid artery, and the inferior thyroid artery, a branch of the thyrocervical
    trunk, and sometimes by an anatomical variant the thyroid ima artery, which has
    a variable origin. \n\nThe superior thyroid artery splits into anterior and posterior
    branches supplying the thyroid, and the inferior thyroid artery splits into superior
    and inferior branches. \n\nThe superior and inferior thyroid arteries join together
    behind the outer part of the thyroid lobes. \n\nThe venous blood is drained via
    superior and middle thyroid veins, which drain to the internal jugular vein,
    and via the inferior thyroid veins. \n\nThe inferior thyroid veins originate
    in a network of veins and drain into the left and right brachiocephalic veins.
    \n\nBoth arteries and veins form a plexus between the two layers of the capsule
    of the thyroid gland.Lymphatic drainage frequently passes the prelaryngeal lymph
    nodes (located just above the isthmus) and the pretracheal and paratracheal lymph
    nodes. \n\nThe gland receives sympathetic nerve supply from the superior, middle
    and inferior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic trunk. \n\nThe gland receives
    parasympathetic nerve supply from the superior laryngeal nerve and the recurrent
    laryngeal nerve.\n\n\n=== Variation ===\n\nThere are many variants in the size
    and shape of the thyroid gland, and in the position of the embedded parathyroid
    glands.\n\nSometimes there is a third lobe present called the pyramidal lobe.
    \n\nWhen present, this lobe often stretches up the hyoid bone from the thyroid
    isthmus and may be one to several divided lobes. \n\nThe presence of this lobe
    ranges in reported studies from 18.3% to 44.6%. \n\nIt was shown to more often
    arise from the left side and occasionally separated. \n\nThe pyramidal lobe is
    also known as Lalouette's pyramid. \n\nThe pyramidal lobe is a remnant of the
    thyroglossal duct, which usually wastes away during the thyroid gland's descent.
    \n\nSmall accessory thyroid glands may in fact occur anywhere along the thyroglossal
    duct, from the foramen cecum of the tongue to the position of the thyroid in
    the adult. \n\nA small horn at the back of the thyroid lobes, usually close to
    the recurrent laryngeal nerve and the inferior thyroid artery, is called Zuckerkandl's
    tubercle.\n\nOther variants include a levator muscle of thyroid gland, connecting
    the isthmus to the body of the hyoid bone, and the presence of the small thyroid
    ima artery.\n\n\n=== Microanatomy ===\n \nAt the microscopic level, there are
    three primary features of the thyroid\u2014follicles, follicular cells, and parafollicular
    cells, first discovered by Geoffery Websterson in 1664.\n\nFolliclesThyroid follicles
    are small spherical groupings of cells 0.02\u20130.9mm in diameter that play
    the main role in thyroid function. \n\nThey consist of a rim that has a rich
    blood supply, nerve and lymphatic presence, that surrounds a core of colloid
    that consists mostly of thyroid hormone precursor proteins called thyroglobulin,
    an iodinated glycoprotein.\n\nFollicular cellsThe core of a follicle is surrounded
    by a single layer of follicular cells. \n\nWhen stimulated by thyroid stimulating
    hormone (TSH), these secrete the thyroid hormones T3 and T4. \n\nThey do this
    by transporting and metabolising the thyroglobulin contained in the colloid.
    \n\nFollicular cells vary in shape from flat to cuboid to columnar, depending
    on how active they are.\n\nParafollicular cellsScattered among follicular cells
    and in spaces between the spherical follicles are another type of thyroid cell,
    parafollicular cells. \n\nThese cells secrete calcitonin and so are also called
    C cells.\n\n\n== Development ==\n\nIn the development of the embryo, at 3\u20134
    weeks gestational age, the thyroid gland appears as an epithelial proliferation
    in the floor of the pharynx at the base of the tongue between the tuberculum
    impar and the copula linguae. \n\nThe copula soon becomes covered over by the
    hypopharyngeal eminence at a point later indicated by the foramen cecum. \n\nThe
    thyroid then descends in front of the pharyngeal gut as a bilobed diverticulum
    through the thyroglossal duct. \n\nOver the next few weeks, it migrates to the
    base of the neck, passing in front of the hyoid bone. \n\nDuring migration, the
    thyroid remains connected to the tongue by a narrow canal, the thyroglossal duct.
    \n\nAt the end of the fifth week the thyroglossal duct degenerates, and over
    the following two weeks the detached thyroid migrates to its final position.\n\nThe
    fetal hypothalamus and pituitary start to secrete thyrotropin-releasing hormone
    (TRH) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). \n\nTSH is first measurable at 11
    weeks. \n\nBy 18\u201320 weeks, the production of thyroxine (T4) reaches a clinically
    significant and self-sufficient level. \n\nFetal triiodothyronine (T3) remains
    low, less than 15 ng/dL until 30 weeks, and increases to 50 ng/dL at full-term.
    \n\nThe fetus needs to be self-sufficient in thyroid hormones in order to guard
    against neurodevelopmental disorders that would arise from maternal hypothyroidism.
    \n\nThe presence of sufficient iodine is essential for healthy neurodevelopment.\n\nThe
    neuroendocrine parafollicular cells, also known as C cells, responsible for the
    production of calcitonin, are derived from foregut endoderm. \n\nThis part of
    the thyroid then first forms as the ultimopharyngeal body, which begins in the
    ventral fourth pharyngeal pouch and joins the primordial thyroid gland during
    its descent to its final location.\n\nAberrations in prenatal development can
    result in various forms of thyroid dysgenesis which can cause congenital hypothyroidism,
    and if untreated this can lead to cretinism.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\n=== Thyroid
    hormones ===\n\nThe primary function of the thyroid is the production of the
    iodine-containing thyroid hormones, triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4)
    and the peptide hormone calcitonin. \n\nThe thyroid hormones are created from
    iodine and tyrosine. \n\nT3 is so named because it contains three atoms of iodine
    per molecule and T4 contains four atoms of iodine per molecule. \n\nThe thyroid
    hormones have a wide range of effects on the human body. \n\nThese include:\n\n-Metabolic.
    \n\nThe thyroid hormones increase the basal metabolic rate and have effects on
    almost all body tissues. \n\nAppetite, the absorption of substances, and gut
    motility are all influenced by thyroid hormones. \n\nThey increase the absorption
    in the gut, generation, uptake by cells, and breakdown of glucose. \n\nThey stimulate
    the breakdown of fats, and increase the number of free fatty acids. \n\nDespite
    increasing free fatty acids, thyroid hormones decrease cholesterol levels, perhaps
    by increasing the rate of secretion of cholesterol in bile.\n\n-Cardiovascular.
    \n\nThe hormones increase the rate and strength of the heartbeat. \n\nThey increase
    the rate of breathing, intake and consumption of oxygen, and increase the activity
    of mitochondria. \n\nCombined, these factors increase blood flow and the body's
    temperature.\n\n-Developmental. \n\nThyroid hormones are important for normal
    development. \n\nThey increase the growth rate of young people, and cells of
    the developing brain are a major target for the thyroid hormones T3 and T4. \n\nThyroid
    hormones play a particularly crucial role in brain maturation during fetal development
    and first few years of postnatal life.\n\nThe thyroid hormones also play a role
    in maintaining normal sexual function, sleep, and thought patterns. \n\nIncreased
    levels are associated with increased speed of thought generation but decreased
    focus. \n\nSexual function, including libido and the maintenance of a normal
    menstrual cycle, are influenced by thyroid hormones.After secretion, only a very
    small proportion of the thyroid hormones travel freely in the blood. \n\nMost
    are bound to thyroxine-binding globulin (about 70%), transthyretin (10%), and
    albumin (15%). \n\nOnly the 0.03% of T4 and 0.3% of T3 traveling freely have
    hormonal activity. \n\nIn addition, up to 85% of the T3 in blood is produced
    following conversion from T4 by iodothyronine deiodinases in organs around the
    body.\n\nThyroid hormones act by crossing the cell membrane and binding to intracellular
    nuclear thyroid hormone receptors TR-\u03B11,TR-\u03B12,TR-\u03B21 and TR-\u03B22,
    which bind with hormone response elements and transcription factors to modulate
    DNA transcription. \n\nIn addition to these actions on DNA, the thyroid hormones
    also act within the cell membrane or within cytoplasm via reactions with enzymes,
    including calcium ATPase, adenylyl cyclase, and glucose transporters.\n\n\n===
    Hormone production ===\n\nThe thyroid hormones are created from thyroglobulin.
    \n\nThis is a protein within the colloid in the follicular lumen that is originally
    created within the rough endoplasmic reticulum of follicular cells and then transported
    into the follicular lumen. \n\nThyroglobulin contains 123 units of tyrosine,
    which reacts with iodine within the follicular lumen.Iodine is essential for
    the production of the thyroid hormones. \n\nIodine (I0) travels in the blood
    as iodide (I\u2212), which is taken up into the follicular cells by a sodium-iodide
    symporter. \n\nThis is an ion channel on the cell membrane which in the same
    action transports two sodium ions and an iodide ion into the cell. \n\nIodide
    then travels from within the cell into the lumen, through the action of pendrin,
    an iodide-chloride antiporter. \n\nIn the follicular lumen, the iodide is then
    oxidized to iodine. \n\nThis makes it more reactive, and the iodine is attached
    to the active tyrosine units in thyroglobulin by the enzyme thyroid peroxidase.
    \n\nThis forms the precursors of thyroid hormones monoiodotyrosine (MIT), and
    diiodotyrosine (DIT).When the follicular cells are stimulated by thyroid-stimulating
    hormone, the follicular cells reabsorb thyroglobulin from the follicular lumen.
    \n\nThe iodinated tyrosines are cleaved, forming the thyroid hormones T4, T3,
    DIT, MIT, and traces of reverse triiodothyronine. \n\nT3 and T4 are released
    into the blood. \n\nThe hormones secreted from the gland are about 80\u201390%
    T4 and about 10\u201320% T3. \n\nDeiodinase enzymes in peripheral tissues remove
    the iodine from MIT and DIT and convert T4 to T3 and RT3. \n\nThis is a major
    source of both RT3 (95%) and T3 (87%) in peripheral tissues.\n\n\n=== Regulation
    ===\n\nThe production of thyroxine and triiodothyronine is primarily regulated
    by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), released by the anterior pituitary gland.
    \n\nTSH release in turn is stimulated by thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH),
    released in a pulsatile manner from the hypothalamus. \n\nThe thyroid hormones
    provide negative feedback to the thyrotropes TSH and TRH: when the thyroid hormones
    are high, TSH production is suppressed. \n\nThis negative feedback also occurs
    when levels of TSH are high, causing TRH production to be suppressed.\n\nTRH
    is secreted at an increased rate in situations such as cold exposure in order
    to stimulate thermogenesis. \n\nIn addition to being suppressed by the presence
    of thyroid hormones, TSH production is blunted by dopamine, somatostatin, and
    glucocorticoids.\n\n\n=== Calcitonin ===\n\nThe thyroid gland also produces the
    hormone calcitonin, which helps regulate blood calcium levels. \n\nParafollicular
    cells produce calcitonin in response to high blood calcium. \n\nCalcitonin decreases
    the release of calcium from bone, by decreasing the activity of osteoclasts,
    cells which break down bone. \n\nBone is constantly reabsorbed by osteoclasts
    and created by osteoblasts, so calcitonin effectively stimulates movement of
    calcium into bone. \n\nThe effects of calcitonin are opposite those of the parathyroid
    hormone (PTH) produced in the parathyroid glands. \n\nHowever, calcitonin seems
    far less essential than PTH, since calcium metabolism remains clinically normal
    after removal of the thyroid (thyroidectomy), but not the parathyroid glands.\n\n\n==
    Gene and protein expression ==\n\nAbout 20,000 protein coding genes are expressed
    in human cells: 70% of these genes are expressed in thyroid cells. \n\nTwo-hundred
    fifty of these genes are more specifically expressed in the thyroid, and about
    20 genes are highly thyroid specific. \n\nIn the follicular cells, the proteins
    synthesized by these genes direct thyroid hormone synthesis\u2014thyroglobulin,
    TPO, and IYD; while in the parafollicular c-cells, they direct calcitonin synthesis\u2014CALCA,
    and CALCB.\n\n\n== Clinical significance ==\n\nGeneral practitioners, family
    physicians, and internal medicine specialists play a role in identifying and
    monitoring the treatment of thyroid disease. \n\nEndocrinologists and thyroidologists
    are thyroid specialists. \n\nThyroid surgeons or otolaryngologists are responsible
    for the surgical management of thyroid disease.\n\n\n=== Functional disorders
    ===\n\n==== Hyperthyroidism ====\n\nExcessive production of the thyroid hormones
    is called hyperthyroidism. \n\nCauses include Graves' disease, toxic multinodular
    goitre, solitary thyroid adenoma, inflammation, and a pituitary adenoma which
    secretes excess TSH. \n\nAnother cause is excess iodine availability, either
    from excess ingestion, induced by the drug amiodarone, or following iodinated
    contrast imaging.\n\nHyperthyroidism often causes a variety of non-specific symptoms
    including weight loss, increased appetite, insomnia, decreased tolerance of heat,
    tremor, palpitations, anxiety and nervousness. \n\nIn some cases it can cause
    chest pain, diarrhoea, hair loss and muscle weakness. \n\nSuch symptoms may be
    managed temporarily with drugs such as beta blockers.Long-term management of
    hyperthyroidism may include drugs that suppress thyroid function such as propylthiouracil,
    carbimazole and methimazole. \n\nAlternatively, radioactive iodine-131 can be
    used to destroy thyroid tissue: radioactive iodine is selectively taken up by
    thyroid cells, which over time destroys them. \n\nThe chosen first-line treatment
    will depend on the individual and on the country where being treated. \n\nSurgery
    to remove the thyroid can sometimes be performed as a transoral thyroidectomy,
    a minimally-invasive procedure. \n\nSurgery does however carry a risk of damage
    to the parathyroid glands and the recurrent laryngeal nerve, which innervates
    the vocal cords. \n\nIf the entire thyroid gland is removed, hypothyroidism will
    inevitably result, and thyroid hormone substitutes will be needed.\n\n\n====
    Hypothyroidism ====\n\nAn underactive thyroid gland results in hypothyroidism.
    \n\nTypical symptoms are abnormal weight gain, tiredness, constipation, heavy
    menstrual bleeding, hair loss, cold intolerance, and a slow heart rate. \n\nIodine
    deficiency is the most common cause of hypothyroidism worldwide, and the autoimmune
    disease Hashimoto's thyroiditis is the most common cause in the developed world.
    \n\nOther causes include congenital abnormalities, diseases causing transient
    inflammation, surgical removal or radioablation of the thyroid, the drugs amiodarone
    and lithium, amyloidosis, and sarcoidosis. \n\nSome forms of hypothyroidism can
    result in myxedema and severe cases can result in myxedema coma.Hypothyroidism
    is managed with replacement of the hormone thyroxine. \n\nThis is usually given
    daily as an oral supplement, and may take a few weeks to become effective. \n\nSome
    causes of hypothyroidism, such as Postpartum thyroiditis and Subacute thyroiditis
    may be transient and pass over time, and other causes such as iodine deficiency
    may be able to be rectified with dietary supplementation.\n\n\n=== Diseases ===\n\n====
    Graves' disease ====\n\nGraves' disease is an autoimmune disorder that is the
    most common cause of hyperthyroidism. \n\nIn Graves' disease, for an unknown
    reason autoantibodies develop against the thyroid stimulating hormone receptor.
    \n\nThese antibodies activate the receptor, leading to development of a goitre
    and symptoms of hyperthyroidism, such as heat intolerance, weight loss, diarrhoea
    and palpitations. \n\nOccasionally such antibodies block but do not activate
    the receptor, leading to symptoms associated with hypothyroidism. \n\nIn addition,
    gradual protrusion of the eyes may occur, called Graves' ophthalmopathy, as may
    swelling of the front of the shins. \n\nGraves' disease can be diagnosed by the
    presence of pathomnomonic features such as involvement of the eyes and shins,
    or isolation of autoantibodies, or by results of a radiolabelled uptake scan.
    \n\nGraves' disease is treated with anti-thyroid drugs such as propylthiouracil,
    which decrease the production of thyroid hormones, but hold a high rate of relapse.
    \n\nIf there is no involvement of the eyes, then use of radioactive isotopes
    to ablate the gland may be considered. \n\nSurgical removal of the gland with
    subsequent thyroid hormone replacement may be considered, however this will not
    control symptoms associated with the eye or skin.\n\n\n==== Nodules ====\n\nThyroid
    nodules are often found on the gland, with a prevalence of 4\u20137%. \n\nThe
    majority of nodules do not cause any symptoms, thyroid hormone secretion is normal,
    and they are non-cancerous. \n\nNon-cancerous cases include simple cysts, colloid
    nodules, and thyroid adenomas. \n\nMalignant nodules, which only occur in about
    5% of nodules, include follicular, papillary, medullary carcinomas and metastases
    from other sites Nodules are more likely in females, those who are exposed to
    radiation, and in those who are iodine deficient.\n\nWhen a nodule is present,
    thyroid function tests determine whether the nodule is secreting excess thyroid
    hormones, causing hyperthyroidism. \n\nWhen the thyroid function tests are normal,
    an ultrasound is often used to investigate the nodule, and provide information
    such as whether the nodule is fluid-filled or a solid mass, and whether the appearance
    is suggestive of a benign or malignant cancer. \n\nA needle aspiration biopsy
    may then be performed, and the sample undergoes cytology, in which the appearance
    of cells is viewed to determine whether they resemble normal or cancerous cells.\n\nThe
    presence of multiple nodules is called a multinodular goitre; and if it is associated
    with hyperthyroidism, it is called a toxic multinodular goitre.\n\n\n==== Goitre
    ====\n\nAn enlarged thyroid gland is called a goitre. \n\nGoitres are present
    in some form in about 5% of people, and are the result of a large number of causes,
    including iodine deficiency, autoimmune disease (both Graves' disease and Hashimoto's
    thyroiditis), infection, inflammation, and infiltrative disease such as sarcoidosis
    and amyloidosis. \n\nSometimes no cause can be found, a state called \"simple
    goitre\".Some forms of goitre are associated with pain, whereas many do not cause
    any symptoms. \n\nEnlarged goitres may extend beyond the normal position of the
    thyroid gland to below the sternum, around the airway or esophagus. \n\nGoitres
    may be associated with hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism, relating to the underlying
    cause of the goitre. \n\nThyroid function tests may be done to investigate the
    cause and effects of the goitre. \n\nThe underlying cause of the goitre may be
    treated, however many goitres with no associated symptoms are simply monitored.\n\n\n====
    Inflammation ====\n\nInflammation of the thyroid is called thyroiditis, and may
    cause symptoms of hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism. \n\nTwo types of thyroiditis
    initially present with hyperthyroidism and are sometimes followed by a period
    of hypothyroidism \u2013 Hashimoto's thyroiditis and postpartum thyroiditis.
    \n\nThere are other disorders that cause inflammation of the thyroid, and these
    include subacute thyroiditis, acute thyroiditis, silent thyroiditis, Riedel's
    thyroiditis and traumatic injury, including palpation thyroiditis.\n\nHashimoto's
    thyroiditis is an autoimmune disorder in which the thyroid gland is infiltrated
    by the lymphocytes B-cell and T-cells. \n\nThese progressively destroy the thyroid
    gland. \n\nIn this way, Hasimoto's thyroiditis may have occurred insidiously,
    and only be noticed when thyroid hormone production decreases, causing symptoms
    of hypothyroidism. \n\nHashimoto's is more common in females than males, much
    more common after the age of 60, and has known genetic risk factors. \n\nAlso
    more common in individuals with Hashimoto's thyroiditis are type 1 diabetes,
    pernicious anaemia, Addison's disease vitiligo.Postpartum thyroiditis occurs
    in some females following childbirth. \n\nAfter delivery, the gland becomes inflamed
    and the condition initially presents with a period of hyperthyroidism followed
    by hypothyroidism and, usually, a return to normal function. \n\nThe course of
    the illness takes place over several months, and is characterised by a painless
    goitre. \n\nAntibodies against thyroid peroxidase can be found on testing. \n\nThe
    inflammation usually resolves without treatment, although thyroid hormone replacement
    may be needed during the period of hypothyroidism.\n\n\n==== Cancer ====\n\nThe
    most common neoplasm affecting the thyroid gland is a benign adenoma, usually
    presenting as a painless mass in the neck. \n\nMalignant thyroid cancers are
    most often carcinomas, although cancer can occur in any tissue that the thyroid
    consists of, including cancer of C-cells and lymphomas. \n\nCancers from other
    sites also rarely lodge in the thyroid. \n\nRadiation of the head and neck presents
    a risk factor for thyroid cancer, and cancer is more common in women than men,
    occurring at a rate of about 2:1.\n\nIn most cases, thyroid cancer presents as
    a painless mass in the neck. \n\nIt is very unusual for thyroid cancers to present
    with other symptoms, although in some cases cancer may cause hyperthyroidism.
    \n\nMost malignant thyroid cancers are papillary, followed by follicular, medullary,
    and thyroid lymphoma. \n\nBecause of the prominence of the thyroid gland, cancer
    is often detected earlier in the course of disease as the cause of a nodule,
    which may undergo fine needle aspiration. \n\nThyroid function tests will help
    reveal whether the nodule produces excess thyroid hormones. \n\nA radioactive
    iodine uptake test can help reveal the activity and location of the cancer and
    metastases.\n\nThyroid cancers are treated by removing the whole or part of thyroid
    gland. \n\nRadioactive Iodine 131 may be given to radioablate the thyroid. \n\nThyroxine
    is given to replace the hormones lost and to suppress TSH production, as TSH
    may stimulate recurrence. \n\nWith the exception of the rare anaplastic thyroid
    cancer, which carries a very poor prognosis, most thyroid cancers carry an excellent
    prognosis and can even be considered curable.\n\n\n==== Congenital ====\nA persistent
    thyroglossal duct is the most common clinically significant congenital disorder
    of the thyroid gland. \n\nA persistent sinus tract may remain as a vestigial
    remnant of the tubular development of the thyroid gland. \n\nParts of this tube
    may be obliterated, leaving small segments to form thyroglossal cysts. \n\nPreterm
    neonates are at risk of hypothyroidism as their thyroid glands are insufficiently
    developed to meet their postnatal needs. \n\nIn order to detect hypothyroidism
    in newborn babies, to prevent growth and development abnormalities in later life,
    many countries have newborn screening programs at birth.\n\nInfants with thyroid
    hormone deficiency (congenital hypothyroidism) can manifest problems of physical
    growth and development as well as brain development, termed cretinism. \n\nChildren
    with congenital hypothyroidism are treated supplementally with levothyroxine,
    which facilitates normal growth and development.Mucinous, clear secretions may
    collect within these cysts to form either spherical masses or fusiform swellings,
    rarely larger than 2 to 3 cm in diameter. \n\nThese are present in the midline
    of the neck anterior to the trachea. \n\nSegments of the duct and cysts that
    occur high in the neck are lined by stratified squamous epithelium, which is
    essentially identical to that covering the posterior portion of the tongue in
    the region of the foramen cecum. \n\nThe disorders that occur in the lower neck
    more proximal to the thyroid gland are lined by epithelium resembling the thyroidal
    acinar epithelium. \n\nCharacteristically, next to the lining epithelium, there
    is an intense lymphocytic infiltrate. \n\nSuperimposed infection may convert
    these lesions into abscess cavities, and rarely, give rise to cancers.\n\nAnother
    disorder is that of thyroid dysgenesis which can result in various presentations
    of one or more misplaced accessory thyroid glands. \n\nThese can be asymptomatic.\n\n\n====
    Iodine ====\n\nIodine deficiency, most common in inland and mountainous areas,
    can predispose to goitre \u2013 if widespread, known as endemic goitre. \n\nPregnant
    women deficient of iodine can give birth to infants with thyroid hormone deficiency.
    \n\nThe use of iodised salt to add iodine to the diet has eliminated endemic
    cretinism in most developed countries, and over 120 countries have made the iodination
    of salt mandatory.\n\nBecause the thyroid concentrates iodine, it also concentrates
    the various radioactive isotopes of iodine produced by nuclear fission. \n\nIn
    the event of large accidental releases of such material into the environment,
    the uptake of radioactive iodine isotopes by the thyroid can, in theory, be blocked
    by saturating the uptake mechanism with a large surplus of non-radioactive iodine,
    taken in the form of potassium iodide tablets. \n\nOne consequence of the Chernobyl
    disaster was an increase in thyroid cancers in children in the years following
    the accident.\n\nExcessive iodine intake is uncommon and usually has no effect
    on the thyroid function. \n\nSometimes though it may cause hyperthyroidism, and
    sometimes hypothyroidism with a resulting goitre.\n\n\n=== Evaluation ===\n\nThe
    thyroid is examined by observation of the gland and surrounding neck for swelling
    or enlargement. \n\nIt is then felt, usually from behind, and a person is often
    asked to swallow to better feel the gland against the fingers of the examiner.
    \n\nThe gland moves up and down with swallowing because of its attachments to
    the thyroid and cricoid cartilages. \n\nIn a healthy person the gland is not
    visible yet is palpable as a soft mass. \n\nExamination of the thyroid gland
    includes the search for abnormal masses and the assessment of overall thyroid
    size. \n\nThe character of the thyroid, swellings, nodules, and their consistency
    may all be able to be felt. \n\nIf a goitre is present, an examiner may also
    feel down the neck consider tapping the upper part of the chest to check for
    extension. \n\nFurther tests may include raising the arms (Pemberton's sign),
    listening to the gland with a stethoscope for bruits, testing of reflexes, and
    palpation of the lymph nodes in the head and neck. \n\nAn examination of the
    thyroid will also include observation of the person as a whole, to look for systemic
    signs such as weight gain or loss, hair loss, and signs in other locations \u2013
    such as protrusion of the eyes or swelling of the calves in Graves' disease.\n\n\n===
    Tests ===\n\nThyroid function tests include a battery of blood tests, including
    the measurement of the thyroid hormones, as well as the measurement of thyroid
    stimulating hormone (TSH). \n\nThey may reveal hyperthyroidism (high T3 and T4),
    hypothyroidism (low T3, T4), or subclinical hyperthyroidism (normal T3 and T4
    with a low TSH).TSH levels are considered the most sensitive marker of thyroid
    dysfunction. \n\nThey are however not always accurate, particularly if the cause
    of hypothyroidism is thought to be related to insufficient thyrotropin releasing
    hormone (TRH) secretion, in which case it may be low or falsely normal. \n\nIn
    such a case a TRH stimulation test, in which TRH is given and TSH levels are
    measured at 30 and 60-minutes after, may be conducted.T3 and T4 can be measured
    directly. \n\nHowever, as the two thyroid hormones travel bound to other molecules,
    and it is the \"free\" component that is biologically active, free T3 and free
    T4 levels can be measured. \n\nT4 is preferred, because in hypothyroidism T3
    levels may be normal. \n\nThe ratio of bound to unbound thyroid hormones is known
    as the thyroid hormone binding ratio (THBR). \n\nIt is also possible to measure
    directly the main carriers of the thyroid hormones, thryoglobulin and throxine-binding
    globulin. \n\nThyroglobulin will also be measurable in a healthy thyroid, and
    will increase with inflammation, and may also be used to measure the success
    of thyroid removal or ablation. \n\nIf successful, thyroglobulin should be undetectable.
    \n\nLastly, antibodies against components of the thyroid, particularly anti-TPO
    and anti-thyroglobulin, can be measured. \n\nThese may be present in normal individuals
    but are highly sensitive for autoimmune-related disease.\n\n\n==== Imaging ====\n\nUltrasound
    of the thyroid may be used to reveal whether structures are solid or filled with
    fluid, helping to differentiate between nodules and goitres and cysts. \n\nIt
    may also help differentiate between malignant and benign lesions.When further
    imaging is required, a radiolabelled iodine-123 or technetium-99 uptake scan
    may take place. \n\nThis can determine the size and shape of lesions, reveal
    whether nodules or goitres are metabolically active, and reveal and monitor sites
    of thyroid disease or cancer deposits outside the thyroid.\n\nA fine needle aspiration
    of a sample of thyroid tissue may be taken in order to evaluate a lesion seen
    on ultrasound which is then sent for histopathology and cytology.Computed tomography
    of the thyroid plays an important role in the evaluation of thyroid cancer. \n\nCT
    scans often incidentally find thyroid abnormalities, and thereby practically
    becomes the first investigation modality.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe thyroid gland
    received its modern name in the 1600s, when the anatomist Thomas Wharton likened
    its shape to that of an Ancient Greek shield or thyos. \n\nHowever, the existence
    of the gland, and of the diseases associated with it, was known long before then.\n\n\n===
    Antiquity ===\n\nThe presence and diseases of the thyroid have been noted and
    treated for thousands of years. \n\nIn 1600 BCE burnt sponge and seaweed (which
    contain iodine) were used within China for the treatment of goitres, a practice
    which has developed in many parts of the world. \n\nIn Ayurvedic medicine, the
    book Sushruta Samhita written about 1400 BCE described hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism
    and goitre. \n\nAristotle and Xenophon in the fifth century BCE describe cases
    of diffuse toxic goitre. \n\nHippocrates and Plato in the fourth century BCE
    provided some of the first descriptions of the gland itself, proposing its function
    as a salivary gland. \n\nPliny the Elder in the first century BCE referred to
    epidemics of goitre in the Alps and proposed treatment with burnt seaweed, a
    practice also referred to by Galen in the second century, referred to burnt sponge
    for the treatment of goitre. \n\nThe Chinese pharmacology text Shennong Ben Cao
    Jing, written ca. 200-250, also refers to goitre.\n\n\n=== Scientific era ===\n\nIn
    1500 polymath Leonardo da Vinci provided the first illustration of the thyroid.
    \n\nIn 1543 anatomist Andreas Vesalius gave the first anatomic description and
    illustration of the gland. \n\nIn 1656 the thyroid received its modern name,
    by the anatomist Thomas Wharton. \n\nThe gland was named thyroid, meaning shield,
    as its shape resembled the shields commonly used in Ancient Greece. \n\nThe English
    name thyroid gland is derived from the medical Latin used by Wharton \u2013 glandula
    thyreoidea. \n\nGlandula means 'gland' in Latin, and thyreoidea can be traced
    back to the Ancient Greek word \u03B8\u03C5\u03C1\u03B5\u03BF\u03B5\u03B9\u03B4\u03AE\u03C2,
    meaning 'shield-like/shield-shaped'.\n\nFrench chemist Bernard Courtois discovered
    iodine in 1811, and in 1896 Eugen Baumann documented it as the central ingredient
    in the thyroid gland. \n\nHe did this by boiling the thyroid glands of a thousand
    sheep, and named the precipitate, a combination of the thyroid hormones, 'iodothyrin'.
    \n\nDavid Marine in 1907 proved that iodine is necessary for thyroid function.Graves'
    disease was described by Robert James Graves in 1834. \n\nThe role of the thyroid
    gland in metabolism was demonstrated in 1895 by Adolf Magnus-Levy. \n\nThyroxine
    was first isolated in 1914 and synthesized in 1927, and triiodothyroxine in 1952.
    \n\nThe conversion of T4 to T3 was discovered in 1970. \n\nThe process of discovering
    TSH took place over the early to mid twentieth century. \n\nTRH was discovered
    by Polish endocrinologist Andrew Schally in 1970, contributing in part to his
    Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1977.\n\nIn the nineteenth century numerous authors
    described both cretinism and myxedema, and their relationship to the thyroid.
    \n\nCharles Mayo coined the term hyperthyroidism in 1910. \n\nHakaru Hashimoto
    documented a case of Hashimoto's thyroiditis in 1912, antibodies in this disease
    were demonstrated in 1956. \n\nKnowledge of the thyroid and its conditions developed
    throughout the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries, with many modern treatments
    and investigative modalities evolving throughout the mid twentieth century, including
    the use of radioactive iodine, thiouracil and fine needle aspiration.\n\n\n===
    Surgery ===\n\nEither Aetius in the sixth century CE or Persian Ali ibn Abbas
    al-Magusi in 990 CE conducted the first recorded thyroidectomy as a treatment
    for goitre. \n\nOperations remained risky and generally were not successful until
    the 19th century, when descriptions emerged from a number of authors including
    Prussian surgeon Theodor Billroth, Swiss surgeon and physiologist Theodor Kocher,
    American physician Charles Mayo, American surgeons William Halsted and George
    Crile. \n\nThese descriptions provided the basis for modern thyroid surgery.
    \n\nTheodor Kocher went on to win the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in
    1909 \"for his work on the physiology, pathology and surgery of the thyroid gland\".\n\n\n==
    Other animals ==\n\nThe thyroid gland is found in all vertebrates. \n\nIn fish,
    it is usually located below the gills and is not always divided into distinct
    lobes. \n\nHowever, in some teleosts, patches of thyroid tissue are found elsewhere
    in the body, associated with the kidneys, spleen, heart, or eyes.\n\nIn tetrapods,
    the thyroid is always found somewhere in the neck region. \n\nIn most tetrapod
    species, there are two paired thyroid glands \u2013 that is, the right and left
    lobes are not joined together. \n\nHowever, there is only ever a single thyroid
    gland in most mammals, and the shape found in humans is common to many other
    species.\n\nIn larval lampreys, the thyroid originates as an exocrine gland,
    secreting its hormones into the gut, and associated with the larva's filter-feeding
    apparatus. \n\nIn the adult lamprey, the gland separates from the gut, and becomes
    endocrine, but this path of development may reflect the evolutionary origin of
    the thyroid. \n\nFor instance, the closest living relatives of vertebrates, the
    tunicates and amphioxi (lancelets), have a structure very similar to that of
    larval lampreys (the endostyle), and this also secretes iodine-containing compounds,
    though not thyroxine.\n\nThyroxine is critical to metabolic regulation, and growth
    throughout the vertebrate clade. \n\nIodine and T4 trigger the change from a
    plant-eating water-dwelling tadpole into a meat-eating land-dwelling frog, with
    better neurological, visuospatial, smell and cognitive abilities for hunting,
    as seen in other predatory animals. \n\nA similar phenomenon happens in the neotenic
    amphibian salamanders, which, without introducing iodine, don't transform into
    land-dwelling adults, and live and reproduce in the larval form of aquatic axolotl.
    \n\nAmong amphibians, administering a thyroid-blocking agent such as propylthiouracil
    (PTU) can prevent tadpoles from metamorphosing into frogs; in contrast, administering
    thyroxine will trigger metamorphosis. \n\nIn amphibian metamorphosis, thyroxine
    and iodine also exert a well-studied experimental model of apoptosis on the cells
    of gills, tail, and fins of tadpoles. \n\nIodine, via iodolipids, has favored
    the evolution of terrestrial animal species and has likely played a crucial role
    in the evolution of the human brain.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid"

  descriptionText: "\n\nURETER\n\n\nThe ureters are tubes made of smooth muscle that
    propel urine from the kidneys to the urinary bladder. \n\nIn a human adult, the
    ureters are usually 20\u201330 cm (8\u201312 in) long and around 3\u20134 mm
    (0.12\u20130.16 in) in diameter. \n\nThe ureter is lined by urothelial cells,
    a type of transitional epithelium, and has an additional smooth muscle layer
    that assists with peristalsis in its lowest third.\nThe ureters can be affected
    by a number of diseases, including urinary tract infections and kidney stone.
    \n\nStenosis is when a ureter is narrowed, due to for example chronic inflammation.
    \n\nCongenital abnormalities that affect the ureters can include the development
    of two ureters on the same side or abnormally placed ureters. \n\nAdditionally,
    reflux of urine from the bladder back up the ureters is a condition commonly
    seen in children.\nThe ureters have been identified for at least two thousand
    years, with the word \"ureter\" stemming from the stem uro- relating to urinating
    and seen in written records since at least the time of Hippocrates. \n\nIt is,
    however, only since the 1500s that the term \"ureter\" has been consistently
    used to refer to the modern structure, and only since the development of medical
    imaging in the 1900s that techniques such as X-ray, CT, and ultrasound have been
    able to view the ureters. \n\nThe ureters are also seen from the inside using
    a flexible camera, called ureteroscopy, which was first described in 1964.\n\n\n==
    Structure ==\n\n\nThe ureters are tubular structures, approximately 20\u201330
    cm (7.9\u201311.8 in) in adults, that pass from the pelvis of each kidney into
    the bladder. \n\nFrom the renal pelvis, they descend on top of the psoas major
    muscle to reach the brim of the pelvis. \n\nHere, they cross in front of the
    common iliac arteries. \n\nThey then pass down along the sides of the pelvis
    and finally curve forward and enter the bladder from its left and right sides
    at the back of the bladder. \n\nThe ureters are 1.5\u20136 mm (0.059\u20130.236
    in) in diameter and surrounded by a layer of smooth muscle for 1\u20132 cm (0.39\u20130.79
    in) near their ends just before they enter the bladder.The ureters enter the
    bladder from its back surface, traveling 1.5\u20132 cm (0.59\u20130.79 in) before
    opening into the bladder at an angle on its outer back surface at the slit-like
    ureteric orifices. \n\nThis location is also called the vesicoureteric junction.
    \n\nIn the contracted bladder, they are about 25 mm (1 in) apart and about the
    same distance from the internal urethral orifice; in the distended bladder, these
    measurements may be increased to about 50 mm (2 in).A number of structures pass
    by, above, and around the ureters on their path down from the kidneys to the
    bladder. \n\nIn its upper part, the ureter travels on the psoas major muscle
    and sits just behind the peritoneum. \n\nAs it passes down the muscle, it travels
    over the genitofemoral nerve. \n\nThe inferior vena cava and the abdominal aorta
    sit to the midline of the right and left ureters, respectively. \n\nIn the lower
    part of the abdomen, the right ureter sits behind the lower mesentery and the
    terminal ileum, and the left ureter sits behind the jejunum and the sigmoid colon.
    \n\nAs the ureters enter the pelvis, they are surrounded by connective tissue,
    and travel backward and outward, passing in front of the internal iliac arteries
    and internal iliac veins. \n\nThey then travel inward and forward, crossing the
    umbilical, inferior vesical, and middle rectal arteries. \n\nFrom here, in males,
    they cross under the vas deferens and in front of the seminal vesicles to enter
    the bladder near the trigone. \n\nIn females, the ureters pass behind the ovaries
    and then travel in the lower midline section of the broad ligament of the uterus.
    \n\nFor a short part, the uterine arteries travel on top for a short (2.5 cm
    (0.98 in)) period. \n\nThey then pass by the cervix, traveling inward towards
    the bladder.\n\n\n=== Blood and lymphatic supply ===\n\nThe arteries which supply
    the ureter vary along its course. \n\nThe upper third of the ureter, closest
    to the kidney, is supplied by the renal arteries. \n\nThe middle part of the
    ureter is supplied by the common iliac arteries, direct branches from the abdominal
    aorta, and gonadal arteries; the gonadal arteries being the testicular artery
    in men and the ovarian artery in women. \n\nThe lower third of the ureter, closest
    to the bladder, is supplied by branches from the internal iliac arteries, mainly
    the superior and inferior vesical arteries. \n\nThe arterial supply can be variable,
    with arteries that contribute include the middle rectal artery, branches directly
    from the aorta, and, in women, the uterine and vaginal arteries.The arteries
    that supply the ureters end in a network of vessels within the adventitia of
    the ureters. \n\nThere are many connections (anastamoses) between the arteries
    of the ureter, particularly in the adventitia, which means damage to a single
    vessel does not compromise the blood supply of the ureter. \n\nVenous drainage
    mostly parallels that of the arterial supply; that is, it begins as a network
    of smaller veins in the adventitia; with the renal veins draining the upper ureters,
    and the vesicular and gonadal veins draining the lower ureters.Lymphatic drainage
    depends on the position of lymphatic vessels in the ureter. \n\nLymph collects
    in submucosal, intramuscular and adventitial lymphatic vessels. \n\nThose vessels
    closer to the kidney drain into renal collecting vessels, and from here into
    the lateral aortic nodes near the gonadal vessels. \n\nThe middle part of the
    ureter drains into the right paracaval and interaortocaval nodes on the right,
    and the left paraaortic nodes on the left. \n\nIn the lower ureter, lymph may
    drain into the common iliac lymph nodes, or lower down in the pelvis to the common,
    external, or internal iliac lymph nodes.\n\n\n=== Nerve supply ===\n\nThe ureters
    are richly supplied by nerves that form a network (plexus) of nerves, the ureteric
    plexus that lies in the adventitia of the ureters. \n\nThis plexus is formed
    from a number of nerve roots directly (T9-12, L1, and S2-4), as well as branches
    from other nerve plexuses and nerves; specifically, the upper third of the ureter
    receives nerve branches from the renal plexus and aortic plexus, the middle part
    receives branches from the upper hypogastric plexus and nerve, and the lower
    ureter receives branches from the lower hypogastric plexus and nerve. \n\nThe
    plexus is in the adventitia. \n\nThese nerves travel in individual bundles and
    along small blood vessels to form the ureteric plexus. \n\nSensation supplied
    is sparse close to the kidneys and increases closer to the bladder.Sensation
    to the ureters is provided by nerves that come from T11 - L2 segments of the
    spinal cord. \n\nWhen pain is caused, for example by spasm of the ureters or
    by a stone, the pain may be referred to the dermatomes of T11 - L2, namely the
    back and sides of the abdomen, the scrotum (males) or labia majora (females)
    and upper part of the front of the thigh.\n\n\n=== Microanatomy ===\n\n\nThe
    ureter is lined by urothelium, a type of transitional epithelium that is capable
    of responding to stretches in the ureters. \n\nThe transitional epithelium may
    appear as a layer of column-shaped cells when relaxed, and of flatter cells when
    distended. \n\nBelow the epithelium sits the lamina propria. \n\nThe lamina propria
    is made up of loose connective tissue with many elastic fibers interspersed with
    blood vessels, veins and lymphatics. \n\nThe ureter is surrounded by two muscular
    layers, an inner longitudinal layer of muscle, and an outer circular or spiral
    layer of muscle. \n\nThe lower third of the ureter has a third muscular layer.
    \n\nBeyond these layers sits an adventitia containing blood vessels, lymphatic
    vessels, and veins.\n\n\n=== Development ===\n\n\nThe ureters develop from the
    ureteric buds, which are outpouchings from the mesonephric duct. \n\nThis is
    a duct, derived from mesoderm, found in the early embryo. \n\nOver time, the
    buds elongate, moving into surrounding mesodermal tissue, dilate, and divide
    into left and right ureters. \n\nEventually, successive divisions from these
    buds form not only the ureters, but also the pelvis, major and minor calyces,
    and collecting ducts of the kidneys.The mesonephric duct is connected with the
    cloaca, which over the course of development splits into a urogenital sinus and
    the anorectal canal. \n\nThe urinary bladder forms from the urogenital sinus.
    \n\nOver time, as the bladder enlarges, it absorbs the surrounding parts of the
    primitive ureters. \n\nFinally, the entry points of the ureters into the bladder
    move upwards, owing to the upward migration of the kidneys in the developing
    embryo.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\nThe ureters are a component of the urinary system.
    \n\nUrine, produced by the kidneys, travels along the ureters to the bladder.
    \n\nIt does this through regular contractions called peristalsis.\n\n\n== Clinical
    significance ==\n\n\n\n=== Ureteral stones ===\n\n\nA kidney stone can move from
    the kidney and become lodged inside the ureter, which can block the flow of urine,
    as well as cause a sharp cramp in the back, side, or lower abdomen. \n\nPain
    often comes in waves lasting up to two hours, then subsides, called renal colic.
    \n\nThe affected kidney could then develop hydronephrosis, should a part of the
    kidney become swollen due to blocked flow of urine. \n\nIt is classically described
    that there are three sites in the ureter where a kidney stone will commonly become
    stuck:\nwhere the ureter meets the renal pelvis; where the iliac blood vessels
    cross the ureters; and where the ureters enter the urinary bladder, however a
    retrospective case study, which is a primary source, of where stones lodged based
    on medical imaging did not show many stones at the place where the iliac blood
    vessels cross.Most stones are compounds containing calcium such as calcium oxalate
    and calcium phosphate. \n\nThe first recommended investigation is a CT scan of
    the abdomen because it can detect almost all stones. \n\nManagement includes
    analgesia, often with nonsteroidal antiinflammatories. \n\nSmall stones (< 4mm)
    may pass themselves; larger stones may require lithotripsy, and those with complications
    such as hydronephrosis or infection may require surgery to remove.\n\n\n=== Reflux
    ===\n\nVesicoureteral reflux refers to the reflux of fluid from the bladder into
    the ureters. \n\nThis condition can be associated with urinary tract infections,
    particularly in children, and is present in up to 28\u201336% of children to
    some degree. \n\nA number of forms of medical imaging are available for diagnosis
    of the condition, with modalities including doppler urinary tract ultrasound,
    MAG 3 nuclear medicine scaning, and a micturition urethrocystogram. \n\nFactors
    that affect which of these are selected depends if a child is able to receive
    a urinary catheter, and whether a child is toilet trained. \n\nWhether these
    investigations are performed at the first time a child has an illness, or later
    and depending on other factors (such as if the causal bacteria is E. coli) differ
    between US, EU and UK guidelines.Management is also variable, with differences
    between international guidelines on issues such as whether prophylactic antibiotics
    should be used, and whether surgery is recommended. \n\nOne reason is most instances
    of vesicoureteral reflux improve by themselves. \n\nIf surgery is considered,
    it generally involves reattaching the ureters to a different spot on the bladder,
    and extending the part of the ureter that it is within the wall of the bladder,
    with the most common surgical option being Cohen's cross-trigonal reimplantation.\n\n\n===
    Anatomical and surgical abnormalities ===\n\nBlockage, or obstruction of the
    ureter can occur, as a result of narrowing within the ureter, or compression
    or fibrosis of structures around the ureter. \n\nNarrowing can result of ureteric
    stones, masses associated with cancer, and other lesions such as endometriosis
    tuberculosis and schistosomiasis. \n\nThings outside the ureters such as constipation
    and retroperitoneal fibrosis can also compress them. \n\nSome congenital abnormalities
    can also result in narrowing or the ureters. \n\nCongenital disorders of the
    ureter and urinary tract affect 10% of infants. \n\nThese include partial or
    total duplication of the ureter (a duplex ureter), or the formation of a second
    irregularly placed (ectopic) ureter; or where the junction with the bladder is
    malformed or a ureterocoele develops (usually in that location). \n\nIf the ureters
    have been resited as a result of surgery, for example due to a kidney transplant
    or due to past surgery for vesicoureteric reflux, that site may also become narrowed.A
    narrowed ureter may lead to ureteric enlargement (dilation) and cause swelling
    of the kidneys (hydronephrosis). \n\nAssociated symptoms may include recurrent
    infections, pain or blood in the urine; and when tested, kidney function might
    be seen to decrease. \n\nThese are considered situations when surgery is needed.
    \n\nMedical imaging, including urinary tract ultrasound, CT or nuclear medicine
    imaging is conducted to investigate many causes. \n\nThis may involve reinserting
    the ureters into a new place on the bladder (reimplantion), or widening of the
    ureter. \n\nA ureteric stent may be inserted to relieve an obstruction. \n\nIf
    the cause cannot be removed, a nephrostomy may be required, which is the insertion
    of a tube connected to the renal pelvis which directly drains urine into a stoma
    bag.\n\n\n=== Cancer ===\n\nCancer of the ureters is known as ureteral cancer.
    \n\nIt is usually due to cancer of the urothelium, the cells that line the surface
    of the ureters. \n\nUrothelial cancer is more common after the age of 40, and
    more common in men than women; other risk factors include smoking and exposure
    to dyes such as aromatic amines and aldehydes. \n\nWhen cancer is present, the
    most common symptom in an affected person is blood in the urine; it may not cause
    symptoms, and a physical medical examination may be otherwise normal, except
    in late disease. \n\nUreteral cancer is most often due to cancer of the cells
    lining the ureter, called transitional cell carcinoma, although it can more rarely
    occur as a squamous cell carcinoma if the type of cells lining the urethra have
    changed due to chronic inflammation, such as due to stones or schistosomiasis.Investigations
    performed usually include collecting a sample of urine for an inspection for
    malignant cells under a microscope, called cytology, as well as medical imaging
    by a CT urogram or ultrasound. \n\nIf a concerning lesion is seen, a flexible
    camera may be inserted into the ureters, called ureteroscopy, in order to view
    the lesion and take a biopsy, and a CT scan will be performed of other body parts
    (a CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis) to look for additional metastatic
    lesions. \n\nAfter the cancer is staged, treatment may involve open surgery to
    remove the affected ureter and kidney if it is involved; or, if the lesion is
    small, it may be removed via ureteroscopy. \n\nPrognosis can vary markedly depending
    on the tumour grade, with a worse prognosis associated with an ulcerating lesion.\n\n\n===
    Injury ===\n\nInjuries to the ureter can occur after penetrating abdominal injuries,
    and injuries at high speeds followed by an abrupt stop (such as a high speed
    car accident). \n\nThe ureter can be injured during surgery to nearby structures.
    \n\nIt is injured in 2 per 10,000 cases of vaginal hysterectomies and 13 per
    10,000 cases of abdominal hysterectomies, usually near the suspensory ligament
    of the ovary or near the cardinal ligament, where the ureter runs close to the
    blood vessels of the uterus.\n\n\n=== Imaging ===\n\nSeveral forms of medical
    imaging exist that are used to view the ureters and urinary tract. \n\nUltrasound
    may be able to show evidence of blockage because of hydronephrosis of the kidneys
    and renal pelvis. \n\nCT scans, including ones where contrast media is injected
    intravenously to better show the ureters, and with contrast to better show lesions,
    and to differentiate benign from malignant lesions. \n\nDye may also be injected
    directly into the ureters or renal tract; an antegrade pyelogram is when contrast
    is injected directly into the renal pelvis, and a retrograde pyelogram is where
    dye is injected into the urinary tract via a catheter, and flows backwards into
    the ureters. \n\nMore invasive forms of imaging include ureteroscopy, which is
    the insertion of a flexible endoscope into the urinary tract to view the ureters.
    \n\nUreteroscopy is most commonly used for medium to large-sized stones when
    less invasive methods of removal are not able to be used.\n\n\n== Other animals
    ==\n\nAll vertebrates have two kidneys located behind the abdomen that produce
    urine, and have a way of excreting it, so that waste products within the urine
    can be removed from the body. \n\nThe structure specifically called the ureter
    is present in amniotes, meaning mammals, birds and reptiles. \n\nThese animals
    possess an adult kidney derived from the metanephros. \n\nThe duct that connects
    the kidney to excrete urine in these animals is the ureter. \n\nIt connects to
    the urinary bladder, from whence urine leaves via the urethra.\n\n\n== History
    ==\n\nThe word \"ureter\" comes from the Ancient Greek stem \"uro\" relating
    to urination, and the first use of the word is seen during the era of Hippocrates
    to refer to the urethra. \n\nThe anatomical structure of the ureter was noted
    by 40 AD. \n\nHowever, the terms \"ureter\" and \"urethra\" were variably used
    to refer to each other thereafter for more than a millennium. \n\nIt was only
    in the 1550s that anatomists such as Bartolomeo Eustacchio and Jacques Dubois
    began to use the terms to specifically and consistently refer to what is in modern
    English called the ureter and the urethra. \n\nFollowing this, in the 19th and
    20th centuries multiple terms relating to the structures such as ureteritis and
    ureterography, were coined.Kidney stones have been identified and recorded about
    as long as written historical records exist. \n\nThe urinary tract including
    the ureters, as well as their function to drain urine from the kidneys, has been
    described by Galen in the second century AD.The first to examine the ureter through
    an internal approach, called ureteroscopy, rather than surgery was Hampton Young
    in 1929. \n\nThis was improved on by VF Marshall who is the first published use
    of a flexible endoscope based on fiber optics, which occurred in 1964. \n\nThe
    insertion of a drainage tube into the renal pelvis, bypassing the ureters and
    urinary tract, called nephrostomy, was first described in 1941. \n\nSuch an approach
    differed greatly from the open surgical approaches within the urinary system
    employed during the preceding two millennia.The first radiological imaging of
    the ureters first occurred via X-rays, although this was made more difficult
    by the thick abdomen, which the low power of the original X-rays was not able
    to penetrate enough to produce clear images. \n\nMore useful images were able
    to be produced when Edwin Hurry Fenwick in 1908 pioneered the use of tubes covered
    in radioopaque material visible to X-rays inserted into the ureters, and in the
    early 20th century when contrasts were injected externally into the urinary tract
    (retrograde pyelograms). \n\nUnfortunately, much of the earlier retrograde pyelograms
    were complicated by significant damage to the kidneys as a result of contrast
    based on silver or sodium iodide. \n\nHryntshalk in 1929 pioneered the development
    of the intravenous urogram, in which contrast is injected into a vein and highlights
    the kidney and, when excreted, the urinary tract. \n\nThings improved with the
    development by Moses Swick and Leopold Lichtwitz in the late 1920s of relatively
    nontoxic contrast media, with controversy surrounding publication as to who was
    the primary discoverer. \n\nSide-effects associated with imaging improved even
    more when Tosten Almen published a ground-breaking thesis in 1969 based on the
    less toxic low-osmolar contrast media, developed based on swimming experiences
    in lakes with different salinity.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ureter"

  descriptionText: "\n\nEPIGLOTTIS\n\n\nThe epiglottis is a leaf-shaped flap in the
    throat that prevents food from entering the windpipe and the lungs. \n\nIt stays
    open during breathing, allowing air into the larynx. \n\nDuring swallowing, it
    closes to prevent aspiration of food into the lungs, forcing the swallowed liquids
    or food to go along the esophagus toward the stomach instead. \n\nIt is thus
    the valve that diverts passage to either the trachea or the esophagus. \n\nThe
    epiglottis is made of elastic cartilage covered with a mucous membrane, attached
    to the entrance of the larynx. \n\nIt projects upwards and backwards behind the
    tongue and the hyoid bone. \n\nThe epiglottis may be inflamed in a condition
    called epiglottitis, which is most commonly due to the vaccine-preventable bacteria
    Haemophilus influenzae. \n\nDysfunction may cause the inhalation of food, called
    aspiration, which may lead to pneumonia or airway obstruction. \n\nThe epiglottis
    is also an important landmark for intubation. \nThe epiglottis has been identified
    as early as Aristotle, and gets its name from being above the glottis (epi- +
    glottis).\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\n\nThe epiglottis sits at the entrance of the
    larynx. \n\nIt is shaped like a leaf of purslane and has a free upper part that
    rests behind the tongue, and a lower stalk (Latin: petiolus). \n\nThe stalk originates
    from the back surface of the thyroid cartilage, connected by a thyroepiglottic
    ligament. \n\nAt the sides, the stalk is connected to the arytenoid cartilages
    at the walls of the larynx by folds.The epiglottis originates at the entrance
    of the larynx, and is attached to the hyoid bone. \n\nFrom there, it projects
    upwards and backwards behind the tongue. \n\nThe space between the epiglottis
    and the tongue is called the vallecula.\n\n\n=== Microanatomy ===\n\nThe epiglottis
    has two surfaces; a forward-facing anterior surface, and a posterior surface
    facing the larynx. \n\nThe forward-facing surface is covered with several layers
    of thin cells (stratified squamous epithelium), and is not covered with keratin,
    the same surface as the back of the tongue. \n\nThe back surface is covered in
    a layer of column-shaped cells with cilia, similar to the rest of the respiratory
    tract. \n\nIt also has mucous-secreting goblet cells. \n\nThere is an intermediate
    zone between these surfaces that contains cells that transition in shape. \n\nThe
    body of the epiglottis consists of elastic cartilage.\n\n\n=== Development ===\n\nThe
    epiglottis arises from the fourth pharyngeal arch. \n\nIt can be seen as a distinct
    structure later than the other cartilage of the pharynx, visible around the fifth
    month of development. \n\nThe position of the epiglottis also changes with ageing.
    \n\nIn infants, it touches the soft palate, whereas in adults, its position is
    lower.\n\n\n=== Variation ===\n\n\nA high-rising epiglottis is a normal anatomical
    variation, visible during an examination of the mouth. \n\nIt does not cause
    any serious problem apart from maybe a mild sensation of a foreign body in the
    throat. \n\nIt is seen more often in children than adults and does not need any
    medical or surgical intervention. \n\nThe front surface of the epiglottis is
    occasionally notched.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\nThe epiglottis is normally pointed
    upward during breathing with its underside functioning as part of the pharynx.
    \n\nThere are taste buds on the epiglottis.\n\n\n=== Swallowing ===\n\nDuring
    swallowing, the epiglottis bends backwards, folding over the entrance to the
    trachea, and preventing food from going into it. \n\nThe folding backwards is
    a complex movement the causes of which are not completely understood. \n\nIt
    is likely that during swallowing the hyoid bone and the larynx move upwards and
    forwards, which increases passive pressure from the back of the tongue; because
    the aryepiglottic muscles contract; because of the passive weight of the food
    pushing down; and because of contraction of laryngeal and because of contraction
    of thyroarytenoid muscles. \n\nThe consequence of this is that during swallowing
    the bent epiglottis blocks off the trachea, preventing food from going into it;
    food instead travels down the esophagus, which is behind it.\n\n\n=== Speech
    sounds ===\n\nIn many languages, the epiglottis is not essential for producing
    sounds. \n\nIn some languages, the epiglottis is used to produce epiglottal consonant
    speech sounds, though this sound-type is rather rare.\n\n\n== Clinical significance
    ==\n\n\n\n=== Inflammation ===\n\n\nInflammation of the epiglottis is known as
    epiglottitis. \n\nEpiglottitis is mainly caused by Haemophilus influenzae. \n\nA
    person with epiglottitis may have a fever, sore throat, difficulty swallowing,
    and difficulty breathing. \n\nFor this reason, acute epiglottitis is considered
    a medical emergency, because of the risk of obstruction of the pharynx. \n\nEpiglottitis
    is often managed with antibiotics, inhaled aerosolised epinephrine to act as
    a bronchodilator, and may require tracheal intubation or a tracheostomy if breathing
    is difficult.\n\nThe incidence of epiglottitis has decreased significantly in
    countries where vaccination against Haemophilus influenzae is administered.\n\n\n===
    Aspiration ===\n\nWhen food or other objects travel down the respiratory tract
    rather than down the esophagus to the stomach, this is called aspiration. \n\nThis
    can lead to airway obstruction, inflammation of lung tissue, and aspiration pneumonia;
    and in the long term, atelectasis and bronchiectasis. \n\nOne reason aspiration
    can occur is because of failure of the epiglottis to close completely.\n\nShould
    food or liquid enter the airway due to the epiglottis failing to close properly,
    throat clearing or the cough reflex may occur to protect the respiratory system
    and expel material from the airway. \n\nWhere there is impairment in laryngeal
    vestibule sensation, silent aspiration (entry of material to the airway that
    does not result in a cough reflex) may occur.\n\n\n=== Other ===\n\nThe epiglottis
    and vallecula are important anatomical landmarks in intubation. \n\nAbnormal
    positioning of the epiglottis is a rare cause of obstructive sleep apnoea.\n\n\n==
    Other animals ==\n\nThe epiglottis is present in mammals, including land mammals
    and cetaceans, also as a cartilaginous structure. \n\nLike in humans, it functions
    to prevent entry of food into the trachea during swallowing. \n\nThe position
    of the larynx is flat in mice and other rodents, including rabbits. \n\nFor this
    reason, because the epiglottis is located behind the soft palate in rabbits,
    they are obligate nose breathers, as are mice and other rodents. \n\nIn rodents
    and mice, there is a unique pouch in front of the epiglottis, and the epiglottis
    is commonly injured by inhaled substances, particularly at the transition zone
    between the flattened and cuboidal epithelium. \n\nIt is also common to see taste
    buds on the epiglottis in these species.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe epiglottis
    was noted by Aristotle, although the epiglottis' function was first defined by
    Vesalius in 1543. \n\nThe word has Greek roots. \n\nThe epiglottis gets its name
    from being above (Ancient Greek: \u1F10\u03C0\u03AF, romanized: epi-) the glottis
    (Ancient Greek: \u03B3\u03BB\u03C9\u03C4\u03C4\u03AF\u03C2, romanized: glottis,
    lit.\u2009'tongue').\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epiglottis"

  descriptionText: "\n\nTAENIA COLI\n\n\nThe taeniae coli (also teniae coli or tenia
    coli) are three separate longitudinal ribbons (taeniae meaning ribbon in Latin)
    of smooth muscle on the outside of the ascending, transverse, descending and
    sigmoid colons. \n\nThey are visible and can be seen just below the serosa or
    fibrosa. \n\nThere are three teniae coli: mesocolic, free and omental taeniae
    coli. \n\nThe teniae coli contract lengthwise to produce the haustra, the bulges
    in the colon.\nThe bands converge at the root of the vermiform appendix. \n\nAt
    the rectosigmoid junction, the taeniae spread out and unite to form the longitudinal
    muscle layer. \n\nIn the caecum, the ascending colon, the descending colon and
    sigmoid colon the positions of these bands are fixed. \n\nThe taenia libera,
    is placed anteriorly in the caecum, ascending, descending and sigmoid colon,
    but is placed inferiorly in the transverse colon. \n\nThe taenia mesocolica is
    present on the posteromedial surface of caecum, ascending, descending and sigmoid
    colon, but is placed posteriorly on transverse colon at the site of attachment
    of transverse mesocolon. \n\nThe taenia omentalis is situated posterolaterally
    in caecum, ascending, descending and sigmoid colon, but is situated on the anterosuperior
    surface of transverse colon where layers three and four of the greater omentum
    meet the transverse colon. \n\nThis change in position is due to the twist in
    transverse colon. \n\nThese bands correspond to the outer layer of the muscularis
    externa, in other portions of the digestive tract.\n\nThe teniae coli are regulated
    by the sacral nerves of the spinal cord, which are under control of the parasympathetic
    nervous system.\n\n\n== Diverticulosis ==\n\n\nSpaces between the circular bands
    of taeniae are weak points in the bowel, and are the sites of diverticulosis.
    \n\nMost diverticulosis occur in the sigmoid colon as it is the segment with
    the highest intraluminal pressure. \n\nDiverticulosis does not occur in the rectum
    as the tenia coli become a continuous muscular layer. \n\nDiverticulosis can
    then become diverticulitis if the patient develops inflammation of the diverticulosis,
    this whole spectrum of disease is called diverticular disease.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taenia_coli"

  descriptionText: "\n\nPROSTATE\n\n\nThe prostate is both an accessory gland of
    the male reproductive system and a muscle-driven mechanical switch between urination
    and ejaculation. \n\nIt is found only in some mammals. \n\nIt differs between
    species anatomically, chemically, and physiologically. \n\nAnatomically, the
    prostate is found below the bladder, with the urethra passing through it. \n\nIt
    is described in gross anatomy as consisting of lobes and in microanatomy by zone.
    \n\nIt is surrounded by an elastic, fibromuscular capsule and contains glandular
    tissue as well as connective tissue.\nThe prostate glands produce and contain
    fluid that forms part of semen, the substance that is emitted during ejaculation
    as part of the male sexual response. \n\nThis prostatic fluid is slightly alkaline,
    milky or white in appearance. \n\nThe alkalinity of semen helps neutralize the
    acidity of the vaginal tract, prolonging the lifespan of sperm. \n\nThe prostatic
    fluid is expelled in the first part of ejaculate, together with most of the sperm,
    because of the action of smooth muscle tissue within the prostate. \n\nIn comparison
    with the few spermatozoa expelled together with mainly seminal vesicular fluid,
    those in prostatic fluid have better motility, longer survival, and better protection
    of genetic material.\nDisorders of the prostate include enlargement, inflammation,
    infection, and cancer. \n\nThe word prostate comes from Ancient Greek \u03C0\u03C1\u03BF\u03C3\u03C4\u03AC\u03C4\u03B7\u03C2,
    prost\xE1t\u0113s, meaning \"one who stands before\", \"protector\", \"guardian\",
    with the term originally used to describe the seminal vesicles.\n\n\n== Structure
    ==\n\nThe prostate is a gland of the male reproductive system. \n\nIn adults,
    it is about the size of a walnut, and has an average weight of about 11 grams,
    usually ranging between 7 and 16 grams. \n\nThe prostate is located in the pelvis.
    \n\nIt sits below the urinary bladder and surrounds the urethra. \n\nThe part
    of the urethra passing through it is called the prostatic urethra, which joins
    with the two ejaculatory ducts. \n\nThe prostate is covered in a surface called
    the prostatic capsule or prostatic fascia.The internal structure of the prostate
    has been described using both lobes and zones. \n\nBecause of the variation in
    descriptions and definitions of lobes, the zone classification is used more predominantly.The
    prostate has been described as consisting of three or four zones. \n\nZones are
    more typically able to be seen on histology, or in medical imaging, such as ultrasound
    or MRI. \n\nThe zones are:\n\nThe \"lobe\" classification describes lobes that,
    while originally defined in the fetus, are also visible in gross anatomy, including
    dissection and when viewed endoscopically. \n\nThe five lobes are the anterior
    lobe or isthmus, the posterior lobe, the right and left lateral lobes, and the
    middle or median lobe.\n\t\t\nInside of the prostate, adjacent and parallel to
    the prostatic urethra, there are two longitudinal muscle systems. \n\nOn the
    front side (ventrally) runs the urethral dilator (musculus dilatator urethrae),
    on the backside (dorsally) runs the muscle switching the urethra into the ejaculatory
    state (musculus ejaculatorius).\n\n\n=== Blood and lymphatic vessels ===\n\nThe
    prostate receives blood through the inferior vesical artery, internal pudendal
    artery, and middle rectal arteries. \n\nThese vessels enter the prostate on its
    outer posterior surface where it meets the bladder, and travel forward to the
    apex of the prostate. \n\nBoth the inferior vesical and the middle rectal arteries
    often arise together directly from the internal iliac arteries. \n\nOn entering
    the bladder, the inferior vesical artery splits into a urethral branch, supplying
    the urethral prostate; and a capsular branch, which travels around the capsule
    and has smaller branches which perforate into the prostate.The veins of the prostate
    form a network \u2013 the prostatic venous plexus, primarily around its front
    and outer surface. \n\nThis network also receives blood from the deep dorsal
    vein of the penis, and is connected via branches to the vesical plexus and internal
    pudendal veins. \n\nVeins drain into the vesical and then internal iliac veins.The
    lymphatic drainage of the prostate depends on the positioning of the area. \n\nVessels
    surrounding the vas deferens, some of the vessels in the seminal vesicle, and
    a vessel from the posterior surface of the prostate drain into the external iliac
    lymph nodes. \n\nSome of the seminal vesicle vessels, prostatic vessels, and
    vessels from the anterior prostate drain into internal iliac lymph nodes. \n\nVessels
    of the prostate itself also drain into the obturator and sacral lymph nodes.\n\n\t\t\n\n\n===
    Microanatomy ===\n\n\nThe prostate consists of glandular and connective tissue.
    \n\nTall column-shaped cells form the lining (the epithelium) of the glands.
    \n\nThese form one layer or may be pseudostratified. \n\nThe epithelium is highly
    variable and areas of low cuboidal or flat cells can also be present, with transitional
    epithelium in the outer regions of the longer ducts. \n\nThe glands are formed
    as many follicles, which in drain into canals and subsequently 12\u201320 main
    ducts, These in turn drain into the urethra as it passes through the prostate.
    \n\nThere are also a small amount of flat cells, which sit next to the basement
    membranes of glands, and act as stem cells.The connective tissue of the prostate
    is made up of fibrous tissue and smooth muscle. \n\nThe fibrous tissue separates
    the gland into lobules. \n\nIt also sits between the glands and is composed of
    randomly orientated smooth-muscle bundles that are continuous with the bladder.Over
    time, thickened secretions called corpora amylacea accumulate in the gland.\n\n\n===
    Gene and protein expression ===\n\n\nAbout 20,000 protein coding genes are expressed
    in human cells and almost 75% of these genes are expressed in the normal prostate.
    \n\nAbout 150 of these genes are more specifically expressed in the prostate,
    with about 20 genes being highly prostate specific. \n\nThe corresponding specific
    proteins are expressed in the glandular and secretory cells of the prostatic
    gland and have functions that are important for the characteristics of semen,
    including prostate-specific proteins, such as the prostate specific antigen (PSA),
    and the Prostatic acid phosphatase.\n\n\n=== Development ===\n\n\nIn the developing
    embryo, at the hind end lies an inpouching called the cloaca. \n\nThis, over
    the fourth to the seventh week, divides into a urogenital sinus and the beginnings
    of the anal canal, with a wall forming between these two inpouchings called the
    urorectal septum. \n\nThe urogenital sinus divides into three parts, with the
    middle part forming the urethra; the upper part is largest and becomes the urinary
    bladder, and the lower part then changes depending on the biological sex of the
    embryo.The prostatic part of the urethra develops from the middle, pelvic, part
    of the urogenital sinus, which is of endodermal origin. \n\nAround the end of
    the third month of embryonic life, outgrowths arise from the prostatic part of
    the urethra and grow into the surrounding mesenchyme. \n\nThe cells lining this
    part of the urethra differentiate into the glandular epithelium of the prostate.
    \n\nThe associated mesenchyme differentiates into the dense connective tissue
    and the smooth muscle of the prostate.Condensation of mesenchyme, urethra, and
    Wolffian ducts gives rise to the adult prostate gland, a composite organ made
    up of several tightly fused glandular and non-glandular components. \n\nTo function
    properly, the prostate needs male hormones (androgens), which are responsible
    for male sex characteristics. \n\nThe main male hormone is testosterone, which
    is produced mainly by the testicles. \n\nIt is dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a metabolite
    of testosterone, that predominantly regulates the prostate. \n\nThe prostate
    gland enlarges over time, until the fourth decade of life.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\nThe
    prostate secretes fluid which becomes part of semen. \n\nSemen is the fluid emitted
    (ejaculated) by males during the sexual response. \n\nWhen sperm is emitted,
    it is transmitted from the vas deferens into the male urethra via the ejaculatory
    ducts, which lie within the prostate gland. \n\nEjaculation is the expulsion
    of semen from the urethra. \n\nSemen is moved into the urethra following contractions
    of the smooth muscle of the vas deferens and seminal vesicles, following stimulation,
    primarily of the glans penis. \n\nStimulation sends nerve signals via the internal
    pudendal nerves to the upper lumbar spine; the nerve signals causing contraction
    act via the hypogastric nerves. \n\nAfter traveling into the urethra, the seminal
    fluid is ejaculated by contraction of the bulbocavernosus muscle. \n\nThe secretions
    of the prostate include proteolytic enzymes, prostatic acid phosphatase, fibrinolysin,
    zinc, and prostate-specific antigen. \n\nTogether with the secretions from the
    seminal vesicles, these form the major fluid part of semen.It is possible for
    some men to achieve orgasm solely through stimulation of the prostate gland,
    such as via prostate massage or anal intercourse. \n\nThis has led to the area
    of the rectal wall adjacent to the prostate to be popularly (yet inaccurately)
    referred to as the \"male G-spot\".The prostate's changes of shape, which facilitate
    the mechanical switch between urination and ejaculation, are mainly driven by
    the two longitudinal muscle systems running along the prostatic urethra. \n\nThese
    are the urethral dilator (musculus dilatator urethrae) on the urethra's front
    side, which contracts during urination and thereby shortens and tilts the prostate
    in its vertical dimension thus widening the prostatic section of the urethral
    tube, and the muscle switching the urethra into the ejaculatory state (musculus
    ejaculatorius) on its backside.In case of an operation, e.g. because of benign
    prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), damaging or sparing of these two muscle systems
    varies considerably depending on the choice of operation type and details of
    the procedure of the chosen technique. \n\nThe effects on postoperational urination
    and ejaculation vary correspondingly. (See also: Surgery for benign prostatic
    hyperplasia).\n\n\n== Clinical significance ==\n\n\n\n=== Inflammation ===\n\n\nProstatitis
    is inflammation of the prostate gland. \n\nIt can be caused by infection with
    bacteria, or other noninfective causes. \n\nInflammation of the prostate can
    cause painful urination or ejaculation, groin pain, difficulty passing urine,
    or constitutional symptoms such as fever or tiredness. \n\nWhen inflamed, the
    prostate becomes enlarged and is tender when touched during digital rectal examination.
    \n\nA culprit bacteria may grow in a urine culture.Acute prostatitis and chronic
    bacterial prostatitis are treated with antibiotics. \n\nChronic non-bacterial
    prostatitis, or male chronic pelvic pain syndrome is treated by a large variety
    of modalities including the medications alpha blockers, nonsteroidal antiinflammatories
    and amitriptyline, antihistamines, and other anxiolytics. \n\nOther treatments
    that are not medications may include physical therapy, psychotherapy, nerve modulators,
    and surgery. \n\nMore recently, a combination of trigger point and psychological
    therapy has proved effective for category III prostatitis as well.\n\n\n=== Enlarged
    prostate ===\n\n\nAn enlarged prostate is called prostatomegaly, with benign
    prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) being the most common cause. \n\nBPH refers to an
    enlargement of the prostate due to an increase in the number of cells that make
    up the prostate (hyperplasia) from a cause that is not a malignancy. \n\nIt is
    very common in older men. \n\nIt is often diagnosed when the prostate has enlarged
    to the point where urination becomes difficult. \n\nSymptoms include needing
    to urinate often (urinary frequency) or taking a while to get started (urinary
    hesitancy). \n\nIf the prostate grows too large, it may constrict the urethra
    and impede the flow of urine, making urination painful and difficult, or in extreme
    cases completely impossible, causing urinary retention. \n\nOver time, chronic
    retention may cause the bladder to become larger and cause a backflow of urine
    into the kidneys (hydronephrosis).BPH can be treated with medication, a minimally
    invasive procedure or, in extreme cases, surgery that removes the prostate. \n\nIn
    general, treatment often begins with an alpha-1 adrenergic receptor antagonist
    medication such as tamsulosin, which reduces the tone of the smooth muscle found
    in the urethra that passes through the prostate, making it easier for urine to
    pass through. \n\nFor people with persistent symptoms, procedures may be considered.
    \n\nThe surgery most often used in such cases is transurethral resection of the
    prostate, in which an instrument is inserted through the urethra to remove prostate
    tissue that is pressing against the upper part of the urethra and restricting
    the flow of urine. \n\nMinimally invasive procedures include transurethral needle
    ablation of the prostate and transurethral microwave thermotherapy. \n\nThese
    outpatient procedures may be followed by the insertion of a temporary stent,
    to allow normal voluntary urination, without exacerbating irritative symptoms.\n\n\n===
    Cancer ===\n\n\nProstate cancer is one of the most common cancers affecting older
    men in the UK, US, Northern Europe and Australia, and a significant cause of
    death for elderly men worldwide. \n\nOften, a person does not have symptoms;
    when they do occur, symptoms may include urinary frequency, urgency, hesitation
    and other symptoms associated with BPH. \n\nUncommonly, such cancers may cause
    weight loss, retention of urine, or symptoms such as back pain due to metastatic
    lesions that have spread outside of the prostate.A digital rectal examination
    and the measurement of a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level are usually the
    first investigations done to check for prostate cancer. \n\nPSA values are difficult
    to interpret, because a high value might be present in a person without cancer,
    and a low value can be present in someone with cancer. \n\nThe next form of testing
    is often the taking of a biopsy to assess for tumour activity and invasiveness.
    \n\nBecause of the significant risk of overdiagnosis with widespread screening
    in the general population, prostate cancer screening is controversial. \n\nIf
    a tumour is confirmed, medical imaging such as an MRI or bone scan may be done
    to check for the presence of tumour metastases in other parts of the body.Prostate
    cancer that is only present in the prostate is often treated with either surgical
    removal of the prostate or with radiotherapy or by the insertion of small radioactive
    particles of iodine-125 or palladium-103, called brachytherapy. \n\nCancer that
    has spread to other parts of the body is usually treated also with hormone therapy,
    to deprive a tumour of sex hormones (androgens) that stimulate proliferation.
    \n\nThis is often done through the use of GnRH analogues or agents that block
    the receptors that androgens act at, such as bicalutamide; occasionally, surgical
    removal of the testes may be done instead. \n\nCancer that does not respond to
    hormonal treatment, or that progresses after treatment, might be treated with
    chemotherapy such as docetaxel. \n\nRadiotherapy may also be used to help with
    pain associated with bony lesions.Sometimes, the decision may be made not to
    treat prostate cancer. \n\nIf a cancer is small and localised, the decision may
    be made to monitor for cancer activity at intervals (\"active surveillance\")
    and defer treatment. \n\nIf a person, because of frailty or other medical conditions
    or reasons, has a life expectancy less than ten years, then the impacts of treatment
    may outweigh any perceived benefits.\n\n\n=== Surgery ===\n\n\nSurgery to remove
    the prostate is called prostatectomy, and is usually done as a treatment for
    cancer limited to the prostate, or prostatic enlargement. \n\nWhen it is done,
    it may be done as open surgery or as laparoscopic (keyhole) surgery. \n\nThese
    are done under general anaesthetic. \n\nUsually the procedure for cancer is a
    radical prostatectomy, which means that the seminal vesicles are removed and
    vas deferens is also tied off. \n\nPart of the prostate can also be removed from
    within the urethra, called transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). \n\nOpen
    surgery may involve a cut that is made in the perineum, or via an approach that
    involves a cut down the midline from the belly button to the pubic bone. \n\nOpen
    surgery may be preferred if there is a suspicion that lymph nodes are involved
    and they need to be removed or biopsied during a procedure. \n\nA perineal approach
    will not involve lymph node removal and may result in less pain and a faster
    recovery following an operation. \n\nA TURP procedure uses a tube inserted into
    the urethra via the penis and some form of heat, electricity or laser to remove
    prostate tissue.The whole prostate can be removed. \n\nComplications that might
    develop because of surgery include urinary incontinence. \n\nErectile dysfunction
    because of damage to nerves during the operation, particularly if a cancer is
    very close to nerves. \n\nEjaculation of semen will not occur during orgasm if
    the vas deferens are tied off and seminal vesicles removed, such as during a
    radial prosatectomy. \n\nThis will mean a man becomes infertile. \n\nSometimes,
    orgasm may not be able to occur or may be painful. \n\nThe penis length may change
    if the part of the urethra within the prostate is also removed. \n\nGeneral complications
    due to surgery can also develop, such as infections, bleeding, inadvertent damage
    to nearby organs or within the abdomen, and the formation of blood clots.\n\n\n==
    History ==\n\nThe prostate was first formally identified by Venetian anatomist
    Niccol\xF2 Massa in Anatomiae libri introductorius (Introduction to Anatomy)
    1536 and illustrated by Flemish anatomist Andreas Vesalius in Tabulae anatomicae
    sex (six anatomical tables) in 1538. \n\nMassa described it as a \"glandular
    flesh upon which rests the neck of the bladder,\" and Vesalius as a \"glandular
    body\". \n\nThe first time a word similar to 'prostate' was used to describe
    the gland is credited to Andr\xE9 du Laurens in 1600, who described it as a term
    already in use by anatomists at the time. \n\nThe term was however used at least
    as early as 1549 by French surgeon Ambroise Pare.At the time, Du Laurens was
    describing what was considered to be a pair of organs (not the single two-lobed
    organ), and the Latin term prostatae that was used was a mistranslation of the
    term for the Ancient Greek word used to describe the seminal vesicles, parastatai;
    although it has been argued that surgeons in Ancient Greece and Rome must have
    at least seen the prostate as an anatomical entity. \n\nThe term prostatae was
    taken rather than the grammatically correct prostator (singular) and prostatores
    (plural) because the gender of the Ancient Greek term was taken as female, when
    it was in fact male.The fact that the prostate was one and not two organs was
    an idea popularised throughout the early 18th century, as was the English language
    term used to describe the organ, prostate, attributed to William Cheselden. \n\nA
    monograph, \"Practical observations on the treatment of the diseases of the prostate
    gland\" by Everard Home in 1811, was important in the history of the prostate
    by describing and naming anatomical parts of the prostate, including the median
    lobe. \n\nThe idea of the five lobes of the prostate was popularized following
    anatomical studies conducted by American urologist Oswald Lowsley in 1912. \n\nJohn
    E. \n\nMcNeal first proposed the idea of \"zones\" in 1968; McNeal found that
    the relatively homogeneous cut surface of an adult prostate in no way resembled
    \"lobes\" and thus led to the description of \"zones\".Prostate cancer was first
    described in a speech to the Medical and Chiurgical Society of London in 1853
    by surgeon John Adams and increasingly described by the late 19th century. \n\nProstate
    cancer was initially considered a rare disease, probably because of shorter life
    expectancies and poorer detection methods in the 19th century. \n\nThe first
    treatments of prostate cancer were surgeries to relieve urinary obstruction.
    \n\nSamuel David Gross has been credited with the first mention of a prostatectomy,
    as \"too absurd to be seriously entertained\" The first removal for prostate
    cancer (radical perineal prostatectomy) was first performed in 1904 by Hugh H.
    \n\nYoung at Johns Hopkins Hospital; partial removal of the gland was conducted
    by Theodore Billroth in 1867.Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) replaced
    radical prostatectomy for symptomatic relief of obstruction in the middle of
    the 20th century because it could better preserve penile erectile function. \n\nRadical
    retropubic prostatectomy was developed in 1983 by Patrick Walsh. \n\nIn 1941,
    Charles B. \n\nHuggins published studies in which he used estrogen to oppose
    testosterone production in men with metastatic prostate cancer. \n\nThis discovery
    of \"chemical castration\" won Huggins the 1966 Nobel Prize in Physiology or
    Medicine.The role of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) in reproduction
    was determined by Andrzej W. \n\nSchally and Roger Guillemin, who both won the
    1977 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for this work. \n\nGnRH receptor agonists,
    such as leuprorelin and goserelin, were subsequently developed and used to treat
    prostate cancer. \n\nRadiation therapy for prostate cancer was first developed
    in the early 20th century and initially consisted of intraprostatic radium implants.
    \n\nExternal beam radiotherapy became more popular as stronger X-ray radiation
    sources became available in the middle of the 20th century. \n\nBrachytherapy
    with implanted seeds (for prostate cancer) was first described in 1983. \n\nSystemic
    chemotherapy for prostate cancer was first studied in the 1970s. \n\nThe initial
    regimen of cyclophosphamide and 5-fluorouracil was quickly joined by multiple
    regimens using a host of other systemic chemotherapy drugs.\n\n\n== Other animals
    ==\n\nThe prostate is found only in mammals. \n\nThe prostate glands of male
    marsupials are proportionally larger than those of placental mammals. \n\nThe
    presence of a functional prostate in monotremes is controversial, and if monotremes
    do possess functional prostates, they may not make the same contribution to semen
    as in other mammals.The structure of the prostate varies, ranging from tubuloalveolar
    (as in humans) to branched tubular. \n\nThe gland is particularly well developed
    in dogs, foxes and boars, though in other mammals, such as bulls, it can be small
    and inconspicuous. \n\nIn other animals, such as marsupials and small ruminants,
    the prostate is disseminate, meaning not specifically localisable as a distinct
    tissue, but present throughout the relevant part of the urethra; in other animals,
    such as red deer and American elk, it may be present as a specific organ and
    in a disseminate form. \n\nIn some marsupial species, the size of the prostate
    gland changes seasonally. \n\nThe prostate is the only accessory gland that occurs
    in male dogs. \n\nDogs can produce in one hour as much prostatic fluid as a human
    can in a day. \n\nThey excrete this fluid along with their urine to mark their
    territory. \n\nAdditionally, dogs are the only species apart from humans seen
    to have a significant incidence of prostate cancer. \n\nIn cetaceans (whales,
    dolphins, porpoises) the prostate is composed of diffuse urethral glands and
    is surrounded by a very powerful compressor muscle.The prostate gland originates
    with tissues in the urethral wall. \n\nThis means the urethra, a compressible
    tube used for urination, runs through the middle of the prostate. \n\nThis leads
    to an evolutionary design fault for some mammals, including human males. \n\nThe
    prostate is prone to infection and enlargement later in life, constricting the
    urethra so urinating becomes slow and painful.Prostatic secretions vary among
    species. \n\nThey are generally composed of simple sugars and are often slightly
    alkaline.\n\n\n== Skene's gland ==\n\nBecause the Skene's gland and the male
    prostate act similarly by secreting prostate-specific antigen (PSA), which is
    an ejaculate protein produced in males, and of prostate-specific acid phosphatase,
    the Skene's glands is sometimes referred to as the \"female prostate\". \n\nAlthough
    it is homologous to the male prostate (developed from the same embryological
    tissues), various aspects of its development in relation to the male prostate
    are widely unknown and a matter of research.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"

  descriptionText: "\n\nCORPUS CAVERNOSUM OF PENIS\n\n\nA corpus cavernosum penis
    (singular) (literally \"cave-like body\" of the penis, plural corpora cavernosa)
    is one of a pair of sponge-like regions of erectile tissue, which contain most
    of the blood in the penis during an erection.\n\nSuch a corpus is homologous
    to the corpus cavernosum clitoridis in the female; the body of the clitoris that
    contains erectile tissue in a pair of corpora cavernosa with a recognisably similar
    structure.\n\n\n== Anatomy ==\n\nThe two corpora cavernosa and corpus spongiosum
    (also known as the corpus cavernosum urethrae in older texts and in the adjacent
    diagram) are three expandable erectile tissues along the length of the penis,
    which fill with blood during penile erection. \n\nThe two corpora cavernosa lie
    along the penis shaft, from the pubic bones to the head of the penis, where they
    join. \n\nThese formations are made of a sponge-like tissue containing trabeculae,
    irregular blood-filled spaces lined by endothelium and separated by septum of
    the penis.\n\nThe male anatomy has no vestibular bulbs, but instead a corpus
    spongiosum, a smaller region along the bottom of the penis, which contains the
    urethra and forms the glans penis.\n\n\n== Physiology ==\n\nIn some circumstances,
    release of nitric oxide precedes relaxation of muscles in the corpora cavernosa
    and corpus spongiosum, in a process similar to female arousal. \n\nThe spongy
    tissue fills with blood, from arteries down the length of the penis. \n\nA little
    blood enters the corpus spongiosum; the remainder engorges the corpora cavernosa,
    which expand to hold 90% of the blood involved in an erection, increasing both
    in length and in diameter. \n\nThe function of the corpus spongiosum is to prevent
    compression of the urethra during erection.\n\nBlood can leave the erectile tissue
    only through a drainage system of veins around the outside wall of the corpus
    cavernosum. \n\nThe expanding spongy tissue presses against a surrounding dense
    tissue (tunica albuginea) constricting these veins, preventing blood from leaving.
    \n\nThe penis becomes rigid as a result. \n\nThe glans penis, the expanded cap
    of the corpus spongiosum, remains more malleable during erection because its
    tunica albuginea is much thinner than elsewhere in the penis.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpus_cavernosum_penis"

  descriptionText: "\n\nPAROTID DUCT\n\n\nThe parotid duct, or Stensen duct,is a
    salivary duct. \n\nIt is the route that saliva takes from the major salivary
    gland, the parotid gland, into the mouth.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe parotid
    duct is formed when several interlobular ducts, the largest ducts inside the
    parotid gland, join. \n\nIt emerges from the parotid gland. \n\nIt runs forward
    along the lateral side of the masseter muscle for around 7 cm. \n\nIn this course,
    the duct is surrounded by the buccal fat pad. \n\nIt takes a steep turn at the
    border of the masseter and passes through the buccinator muscle, opening into
    the vestibule of the mouth, the region of the mouth between the cheek and the
    gums, at the parotid papilla, which lies across the second Maxillary (upper)
    molar tooth.\n\nThe buccinator acts as a valve that prevents air forcing into
    the duct, which would cause pneumoparotitis. \n\nRunning along with the duct
    superiorly is the transverse facial artery and upper buccal nerve; running along
    with the duct inferiorly is the lower buccal nerve.\n\nThe exit of the parotid
    ducts can be felt as small bumps (papillae) on both sides of the mouth, and are
    usually positioned next to the maxillary second molars.\n\n\n=== Relations ===\n\nThe
    parotid duct lies close to the buccal branch of the facial nerve (VII). \n\nIt
    is also close to the transverse facial artery.\n\n\n== Clinical significance
    ==\n\nBlockage, whether caused by salivary duct stones or external compression,
    may cause pain and swelling of the parotid gland (parotitis).\n\nKoplik's spots
    which are pathognomonic of measles are found near the opening of the parotid
    duct.\n\nThe parotid duct may be cannulated by inserting a tube through the internal
    orifice in the mouth. \n\nDye may be injected to allow for imaging of the parotid
    duct.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe parotid duct is named after Nicolas Steno (1638\u20131686),
    also known as Niels Stensen, a Danish anatomist (albeit best known as a geologist)
    credited with its detailed description in 1660. \n\nThis is where the alternative
    name \"Stensen duct\" originates from.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parotid_duct"

    travel, for the suspension and the supply of the colon.\n\nFeneis 210.16\n\nThe
    mesocolon was thought to be a fragmented structure, with all named parts\u2014the
    ascending, transverse, descending, and sigmoid mesocolons, the mesoappendix,
    and the mesorectum\u2014separately terminating their insertion into the posterior
    abdominal wall.\n\nHowever, in 2012, new microscopic and electron microscopic
    examinations showed the mesocolon to be a single structure derived from the duodenojejunal
    flexure and extending to the distal mesorectal layer.\n\nThe mesocolon regions
    were traditionally taught to be separate sections with separate insertions into
    the posterior abdominal wall. \n\nIn 2012, the first detailed observational and
    histological studies of the mesocolon were undertaken and this revealed several
    new findings.\n\nThe study included 109 patients undergoing open, elective, total
    abdominal colectomy. \n\nAnatomical observations were recorded during the surgery
    and on the post-operative specimens.\n\nThese studies showed that the mesocolon
    is continuous from the ileocaecal to the rectosigmoid level. \n\nIt was also
    shown that a mesenteric confluence occurs at the ileocaecal and rectosigmoid
    junctions, as well as at the hepatic and splenic flexures and that each confluence
    involves peritoneal and omental attachments. \n\nThe proximal rectum was shown
    to originate at the confluence of the mesorectum and mesosigmoid. \n\nA plane
    occupied by perinephric fascia was shown to separate the entire apposed small
    intestinal mesentery and the mesocolon from the retroperitoneum. \n\nDeep in
    the pelvis, this fascia coalesces to give rise to presacral fascia.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesentery#Structure"

  descriptionText: "\n\nSEMINAL GLANDS/SEMINAL VESICLES\n\n\nThe seminal vesicles
    (also called vesicular glands, or seminal glands) are a pair of two convoluted
    tubular glands that lie behind the urinary bladder of some male mammals. \n\nThey
    secrete fluid that partly composes the semen.\n\nThe vesicles are 5\u201310 cm
    in size, 3\u20135 cm in diameter, and are located between the bladder and the
    rectum. \n\nThey have multiple outpouchings which contain secretory glands, which
    join together with the vas deferens as the ejaculatory duct. \n\nThey receive
    blood from the vesiculodeferential artery, and drain into the vesiculodeferential
    veins. \n\nThe glands are lined with column-shaped and cuboidal cells. \n\nThe
    vesicles are present in many groups of mammals, but not marsupials, monotremes
    or carnivores.\n\nInflammation of the seminal vesicles is called seminal vesiculitis,
    most often is due to bacterial infection as a result of a sexually transmitted
    disease or following a surgical procedure. \n\nSeminal vesiculitis can cause
    pain in the lower abdomen, scrotum, penis or peritoneum, painful ejaculation,
    and blood in the semen. \n\nIt is usually treated with antibiotics, although
    may require surgical drainage in complicated cases. \n\nOther conditions may
    affect the vesicles, including congenital abnormalities such as failure or incomplete
    formation, and, uncommonly, tumours.\n\nThe seminal vesicles have been described
    as early as the second century AD by Galen, although the vesicles only received
    their name much later, as they were initially described using the term from which
    the word prostate is derived.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe seminal vesicles are
    a pair of glands in males that are positioned below the urinary bladder and at
    the end of the vasa deferentia, where they enter the prostate. \n\nEach vesicle
    is a coiled and folded tube, with occasional outpouchings termed diverticula
    in its wall. \n\nThe lower part of the tube ends as a straight tube called the
    excretory duct which joins with the vas deferens of that side of the body to
    form an ejaculatory duct. \n\nThe ejaculatory ducts pass through the prostate
    gland before opening separately into the verumontanum of the prostatic urethra.
    \n\nThe vesicles are between 5\u201310 cm in size, 3\u20135 cm in diameter, and
    have a volume of around 13 mL.The vesicles receive blood supply from the vesiculodeferential
    artery, and also from the inferior vesical artery. \n\nThe vesiculodeferential
    artery arises from the umbilical arteries, which branch directly from the internal
    iliac arteries. \n\nBlood is drained into the vesiculodeferential veins and the
    inferior vesical plexus, which drain into the internal iliac veins. \n\nLymphatic
    drainage occurs along the venous routes, draining into the internal iliac nodes.The
    vesicles lie behind the bladder at the end of the vasa deferentia. \n\nThey lie
    in the space between the bladder and the rectum; the bladder and prostate lie
    in front, the tip of the ureter as it enters the bladder above, and Denonvilliers
    fascia and the rectum behind.\n\n\n=== Development ===\n\n\nIn the developing
    embryo, at the hind end lies a cloaca. \n\nThis, over the fourth to the seventh
    week, divides into a urogenital sinus and the beginnings of the anal canal, with
    a wall forming between these two inpouchings called the urorectal septum. \n\nTwo
    ducts form next to each other that connect to the urogenital sinus; the mesonephric
    duct and the paramesonephric duct, which go on to form the reproductive tracts
    of the male and female respectively.In the male, under the influence of testosterone,
    the mesonephric duct proliferates, forming the epididymis, ductus deferens and,
    via a small outpouching near the developing prostate, the seminal vesicles. \n\nSertoli
    cells secrete anti-mullerian hormone, which causes the paramesonephric duct to
    regress.\n\nThe development and maintenance of the seminal vesicles, as well
    as their secretion and size/weight, are highly dependent on androgens. \n\nThe
    seminal vesicles contain 5\u03B1-reductase, which metabolizes testosterone into
    its much more potent metabolite, dihydrotestosterone (DHT). \n\nThe seminal vesicles
    have also been found to contain luteinizing hormone receptors, and hence may
    also be regulated by the ligand of this receptor, luteinizing hormone.\n\n\n===
    Microanatomy ===\n\nThe inner lining of the seminal vesicles (the epithelium)
    is made of a lining of interspersed column-shaped and cube-shaped cells. \n\nThere
    are varying descriptions of the lining as being pseudostratified and consisting
    of column-shaped cells only. \n\nWhen viewed under a microscope, the cells are
    seen to have large bubbles in their interior. \n\nThis is because their interior,
    called cytoplasm, contains lipid droplets involved in secretion during ejaculation.
    \n\nThe tissue of the seminal vesicles is full of glands, spaced irregularly.
    \n\nAs well as glands, the seminal vesicles contain smooth muscle and connective
    tissue. \n\nThis fibrous and muscular tissue surrounds the glands, helping to
    expel their contents. \n\nThe outer surface of the glands is covered in peritoneum.\n\n\t\t\n==
    Function ==\n\nThe seminal vesicles secrete a significant proportion of the fluid
    that ultimately becomes semen. \n\nFluid is secreted from the ejaculatory ducts
    of the vesicles into the vas deferens, where it becomes part of semen. \n\nThis
    then passes through the urethra, where it is ejaculated during a male sexual
    response.About 70-85% of the seminal fluid in humans originates from the seminal
    vesicles. \n\nThe fluid consists of nutrients including fructose and citric acid,
    prostaglandins, and fibrinogen. \n\nNutrients help support sperm until fertilisation
    occurs; prostaglandins may also assist by softening mucous of the cervix, and
    by causing reverse contractions of parts of the female reproductive tract such
    as the fallopian tubes, to ensure that sperm are less likely to be expelled.\n\n\n==
    Clinical significance ==\n\n\n\n=== Disease ===\n\nSeminal vesiculitis (also
    known as spermatocystitis) is an inflammation of the seminal vesicles, most often
    caused by bacterial infection. \n\nSymptoms can include vague back or lower abdominal
    pain; pain of the penis, scrotum or peritoneum; painful ejaculation; blood in
    the semen on ejaculation; irritative and obstructive voiding symptoms; and impotence.
    \n\nInfection may be due to sexually transmitted infections, as a complication
    of a procedure such as prostate biopsy. \n\nIt is usually treated with antibiotics.
    \n\nIf a person experiences ongoing discomfort, transurethral seminal vesiculoscopy
    may be considered. \n\nIntervention in the form of drainage through the skin
    or surgery may also be required if the infection becomes an abscess. \n\nThe
    seminal vesicles may also be affected by tuberculosis, schistosomiasis and hydatid
    disease. \n\nThese diseases are investigated, diagnosed and treated according
    to the underlying disease.\n\nCongenital anomalies associated with the seminal
    vesicles include failure to develop, either completely (agenesis) or partially
    (hypoplasia), and cysts. \n\nFailure of the vesicles to form is often associated
    with absent vas deferens, or an abnormal connection between the vas deferens
    and the ureter. \n\nThe seminal vesicles may also be affected by cysts, amyloidosis,
    and stones. \n\nStones or cysts that become infected, or obstruct the vas deferens
    or seminal vesicles, may require surgical intervention.\n\nBenign tumours of
    the seminal vesicles are rare. \n\nWhen they do occur, they are usually papillary
    adenomas and cystadenomas. \n\nThey do not cause elevation of tumour markers,
    and are usually diagnosed based examination of tissue that has been removed after
    surgery. \n\nPrimary adenocarcinoma of the seminal vesicles, although rare, constitutes
    the most common malignant cancer of the seminal vesicles; that said, the majority
    of malignant cancers affecting the vesicles are lesions that have extended into
    the vesicles from nearby parts of the body. \n\nWhen adenocarcinoma occurs, it
    can cause blood in the urine, blood in the semen, painful urination, urinary
    retention, or even urinary obstruction. \n\nAdenocarcinomata are usually diagnosed
    after they are excised, based on tissue diagnosis. \n\nSome produce the tumour
    marker Ca-125, which can be used to monitor for reoccurence afterwards. \n\nEven
    rarer neoplasms include sarcoma, squamous cell carcinoma, yolk sac tumor, neuroendocrine
    carcinoma, paraganglioma, epithelial stromal tumors and lymphoma.\n\n\n=== Investigations
    ===\n\nSymptoms due to diseases of the seminal vesicles may be vague and not
    able to be specifically attributable to the vesicles themselves; additionally,
    some conditions such as tumours or cysts may not cause any symptoms at all. \n\nWhen
    diseases is suspected, such as due to pain on ejaculation, blood in the urine,
    infertility, due to urinary tract obstruction, further investigations may be
    conducted.\n\nA digital rectal examination, which involves a finger inserted
    by a medical practitioner through the anus, may cause greater than usual tenderness
    of the prostate gland, or may reveal a large seminal vesicle. \n\nA urine specimen
    may be collected, and is likely to demonstrate blood within the urine. \n\nLaboratory
    examination of seminal vesicle fluid requires a semen sample, e.g. for semen
    culture or semen analysis. \n\nFructose levels provide a measure of seminal vesicle
    function and, if absent, bilateral agenesis or obstruction is suspected.\n\nImaging
    of the vesicles is provided by medical imaging; either by transrectal ultrasound,
    CT or MRI scans. \n\nAn examination using cystoscopy, where a flexible tube is
    inserted in the urethra, may show disease of the vesicles because of changes
    in the normal appearance of the nearby bladder trigone, or prostatic urethra.\n\n\n==
    Other animals ==\n\nThe evolution of seminal vesicles may have been influenced
    by sexual selection. \n\nThey occur in many groups of mammals, but are absent
    in marsupials, monotremes, and carnivores. \n\nThe function is similar in all
    mammals they are present in, which is to secrete a fluid as part of semen that
    is ejaculated during the sexual response.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe action of
    the seminal vesicles has been described as early the second century AD by Galen,
    as \"glandular bodies\" that secrete substances alongside semen during reproduction.
    \n\nBy the time of Herophilus the presence of the glands and associated ducts
    had been described. \n\nAround the time of the early 17th century the word used
    to describe the vesicles, parastatai, eventually and unambiguously was used to
    refer to the prostate gland, rather than the vesicles. \n\nThe first time the
    prostate was portrayed in an individual drawing was by Reiner De Graaf in 1678.\n\nThe
    first described use of laparoscopic surgery on the vesicles was described in
    1993; this is now the preferred approach because of decreased pain, complications,
    and a shorter hospital stay.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seminal_vesicles"

  descriptionText: "\n\nGALLBLADDER\n\n\nIn vertebrates, the gallbladder, also known
    as the cholecyst, is a small hollow organ where bile is stored and concentrated
    before it is released into the small intestine. \n\nIn humans, the pear-shaped
    gallbladder lies beneath the liver, although the structure and position of the
    gallbladder can vary significantly among animal species. \n\nIt receives and
    stores bile, produced by the liver, via the common hepatic duct, and releases
    it via the common bile duct into the duodenum, where the bile helps in the digestion
    of fats.\n\nThe gallbladder can be affected by gallstones, formed by material
    that cannot be dissolved \u2013 usually cholesterol or bilirubin, a product of
    haemoglobin breakdown. \n\nThese may cause significant pain, particularly in
    the upper-right corner of the abdomen, and are often treated with removal of
    the gallbladder called a cholecystectomy. \n\nCholecystitis, inflammation of
    the gallbladder, has a wide range of causes, including result from the impaction
    of gallstones, infection, and autoimmune disease.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe
    gallbladder is a hollow organ that sits in a shallow depression below the right
    lobe of the liver, which is grey-blue in life. \n\nIn adults, the gallbladder
    measures approximately 7 to 10 centimetres (2.8 to 3.9 inches) in length and
    4 centimetres (1.6 in) in diameter when fully distended. \n\nThe gallbladder
    has a capacity of about 50 millilitres (1.8 imperial fluid ounces).\n\nThe gallbladder
    is shaped like a pear, with its tip opening into the cystic duct. \n\nThe gallbladder
    is divided into three sections: the fundus, body, and neck. \n\nThe fundus is
    the rounded base, angled so that it faces the abdominal wall. \n\nThe body lies
    in a depression in the surface of the lower liver. \n\nThe neck tapers and is
    continuous with the cystic duct, part of the biliary tree. \n\nThe gallbladder
    fossa, against which the fundus and body of the gallbladder lie, is found beneath
    the junction of hepatic segments IVB and V. \n\nThe cystic duct unites with the
    common hepatic duct to become the common bile duct. \n\nAt the junction of the
    neck of the gallbladder and the cystic duct, there is an out-pouching of the
    gallbladder wall forming a mucosal fold known as \"Hartmann's pouch\".Lymphatic
    drainage of the gallbladder follows the cystic node which is located between
    cystic duct and common hepatic ducts. \n\nLymphatics from the lower part of the
    drain into lower hepatic lymph nodes. \n\nAll the lymph finally drains into celiac
    lymph nodes.\n\n\n=== Microanatomy ===\n\n\nThe gallbladder wall is composed
    of a number of layers. \n\nThe gallbladder wall's innermost surface is lined
    by a single layer of columnar cells with a brush border of microvilli, very similar
    to intestinal absorptive cells. \n\nUnderneath the epithelium is an underlying
    lamina propria, a muscular layer, an outer perimuscular layer and serosa. \n\nUnlike
    elsewhere in the intestinal tract, the gallbladder does not have a muscularis
    mucosae, and the muscular fibres are not arranged in distinct layers.\n\nThe
    mucosa, the inner portion of the gallbladder wall, consists of a lining of a
    single layer of columnar cells, with cells possessing small hair-like attachments
    called microvilli. \n\nThis sits on a thin layer of connective tissue, the lamina
    propria. \n\nThe mucosa is curved and collected into tiny outpouchings called
    rugae.A muscular layer sits beneath the mucosa. \n\nThis is formed by smooth
    muscle, with fibres that lie in longitudinal, oblique and transverse directions,
    and are not arranged in separate layers. \n\nThe muscle fibres here contract
    to expel bile from the gallbladder. \n\nA distinctive feature of the gallbladder
    is the presence of Rokitansky\u2013Aschoff sinuses, deep outpouchings of the
    mucosa that can extend through the muscular layer, and which indicate adenomyomatosis.
    \n\nThe muscular layer is surrounded by a layer of connective and fat tissue.The
    outer layer of the fundus of gallbladder, and the surfaces not in contact with
    the liver, are covered by a thick serosa, which is exposed to the peritoneum.
    \n\nThe serosa contains blood vessels and lymphatics. \n\nThe surfaces in contact
    with the liver are covered in connective tissue.\n\n\n=== Variation ===\n\n\nThe
    gallbladder varies in size, shape, and position between different people. \n\nRarely,
    two or even three gallbladders may coexist, either as separate bladders draining
    into the cystic duct, or sharing a common branch that drains into the cystic
    duct. \n\nAdditionally, the gallbladder may fail to form at all. \n\nGallbladders
    with two lobes separated by a septum may also exist. \n\nThese abnormalities
    are not likely to affect function and are generally asymptomatic.\n\nThe location
    of the gallbladder in relation to the liver may also vary, with documented variants
    including gallbladders found within, above, on the left side of, behind, and
    detached or suspended from the liver. \n\nSuch variants are very rare: from 1886
    to 1998, only 110 cases of left-lying liver, or less than one per year, were
    reported in scientific literature.An anatomical variation can occur, known as
    a Phrygian cap, which is an innocuous fold in the fundus, named after its resemblance
    to the Phrygian cap.\n\n\n=== Development ===\n\nThe gallbladder develops from
    an endodermal outpouching of the embryonic gut tube. \n\nEarly in development,
    the human embryo has three germ layers and abuts an embryonic yolk sac. \n\nDuring
    the second week of embryogenesis, as the embryo grows, it begins to surround
    and envelop portions of this sac. \n\nThe enveloped portions form the basis for
    the adult gastrointestinal tract. \n\nSections of this foregut begin to differentiate
    into the organs of the gastrointestinal tract, such as the esophagus, stomach,
    and intestines.During the fourth week of embryological development, the stomach
    rotates. \n\nThe stomach, originally lying in the midline of the embryo, rotates
    so that its body is on the left. \n\nThis rotation also affects the part of the
    gastrointestinal tube immediately below the stomach, which will go on to become
    the duodenum. \n\nBy the end of the fourth week, the developing duodenum begins
    to spout a small outpouching on its right side, the hepatic diverticulum, which
    will go on to become the biliary tree. \n\nJust below this is a second outpouching,
    known as the cystic diverticulum, that will eventually develop into the gallbladder.\n\n\n==
    Function ==\n\n\nThe main function of the gallbladder is to store bile, also
    called gall, needed for the digestion of fats in food. \n\nProduced by the liver,
    bile flows through small vessels into the larger hepatic ducts and ultimately
    through the cystic duct (parts of the biliary tree) into the gallbladder, where
    it is stored. \n\nAt any one time, 30 to 60 millilitres (1.0 to 2.0 US fl oz)
    of bile is stored within the gallbladder.When food containing fat enters the
    digestive tract, it stimulates the secretion of cholecystokinin (CCK) from I
    cells of the duodenum and jejunum. \n\nIn response to cholecystokinin, the gallbladder
    rhythmically contracts and releases its contents into the common bile duct, eventually
    draining into the duodenum. \n\nThe bile emulsifies fats in partly digested food,
    thereby assisting their absorption. \n\nBile consists primarily of water and
    bile salts, and also acts as a means of eliminating bilirubin, a product of hemoglobin
    metabolism, from the body.\n\nThe bile that is secreted by the liver and stored
    in the gallbladder is not the same as the bile that is secreted by the gallbladder.
    \n\nDuring gallbladder storage of bile, it is concentrated 3-10 fold by removal
    of some water and electrolytes. \n\nThis is through the active transport of sodium
    and chloride ions across the epithelium of the gallbladder, which creates an
    osmotic pressure that also causes water and other electrolytes to be reabsorbed.\n\n\n==
    Clinical significance ==\n\n\n=== Gallstones ===\n\n\nGallstones form when the
    bile is saturated, usually with either cholesterol or bilirubin. \n\nMost gallstones
    do not cause symptoms, with stones either remaining in the gallbladder or passed
    along the biliary system. \n\nWhen symptoms occur, severe \"colicky\" pain in
    the upper right part of the abdomen is often felt. \n\nIf the stone blocks the
    gallbladder, inflammation known as cholecystitis may result. \n\nIf the stone
    lodges in the biliary system, jaundice may occur; if the stone blocks the pancreatic
    duct, pancreatitis may occur. \n\nGallstones are diagnosed using ultrasound.
    \n\nWhen a symptomatic gallstone occurs, it is often managed by waiting for it
    to be passed naturally. \n\nGiven the likelihood of recurrent gallstones, surgery
    to remove the gallbladder is often considered. \n\nSome medication, such as ursodeoxycholic
    acid, may be used; lithotripsy, a procedure used to break down the stones, may
    also be used.\n\n\n=== Inflammation ===\n\n\nKnown as cholecystitis, inflammation
    of the gallbladder is commonly caused by obstruction of the duct with gallstones,
    which is known as cholelithiasis. \n\nBlocked bile accumulates, and pressure
    on the gallbladder wall may lead to the release of substances that cause inflammation,
    such as phospholipase. \n\nThere is also the risk of bacterial infection. \n\nAn
    inflamed gallbladder is likely to cause sharp and localised pain, fever, and
    tenderness in the upper, right corner of the abdomen, and may have a positive
    Murphy's sign. \n\nCholecystitis is often managed with rest and antibiotics,
    particularly cephalosporins and, in severe cases, metronidazole. \n\nAdditionally
    the gallbladder may need to be removed surgically if inflammation has progressed
    far enough.\n\n\n=== Gallbladder removal ===\n\n\nA cholecystectomy is a procedure
    in which the gallbladder is removed. \n\nIt may be removed because of recurrent
    gallstones and is considered an elective procedure. \n\nA cholecystectomy may
    be an open procedure, or a laparoscopic one. \n\nIn the surgery, the gallbladder
    is removed from the neck to the fundus, and so bile will drain directly from
    the liver into the biliary tree. \n\nAbout 30 percent of patients may experience
    some degree of indigestion following the procedure, although severe complications
    are much rarer. \n\nAbout 10 percent of surgeries lead to a chronic condition
    of postcholecystectomy syndrome.\n\n\n=== Complication ===\n\n\nBiliary injury
    (bile duct injury) is the traumatic damage of the bile ducts. \n\nIt is most
    commonly an iatrogenic complication of cholecystectomy \u2014 surgical removal
    of gall bladder, but can also be caused by other operations or by major trauma.
    \n\nThe risk of biliary injury is more during laparoscopic cholecystectomy than
    during open cholecystectomy. \n\nBiliary injury may lead to several complications
    and may even cause death if not diagnosed in time and managed properly. \n\nIdeally
    biliary injury should be managed at a center with facilities and expertise in
    endoscopy, radiology and surgery.Biloma is collection of bile within the abdominal
    cavity. \n\nIt happens when there is a bile leak, for example after surgery for
    removing the gallbladder (laparoscopic cholecystectomy), with an incidence of
    0.3\u20132%. \n\nOther causes are biliary surgery, liver biopsy, abdominal trauma,
    and, rarely, spontaneous perforation.\n\n\n=== Cancer ===\n\n\nCancer of the
    gallbladder is uncommon and mostly occurs in later life. \n\nWhen cancer occurs,
    it is mostly of the glands lining the surface of the gallbladder (adenocarcinoma).
    \n\nGallstones are thought to be linked to the formation of cancer. \n\nOther
    risk factors include large (>1 cm) gallbladder polyps and having a highly calcified
    \"porcelain\" gallbladder.\n\nCancer of the gallbladder can cause attacks of
    biliary pain, yellowing of the skin (jaundice), and weight loss. \n\nA large
    gallbladder may be able to be felt in the abdomen. \n\nLiver function tests may
    be elevated, particularly involving GGT and ALP, with ultrasound and CT scans
    being considered medical imaging investigations of choice. \n\nCancer of the
    gallbladder is managed by removing the gallbladder, however, as of 2010, the
    prognosis remains poor.\n\nCancer of the gallbladder may also be found incidentally
    after surgical removal of the gallbladder, with 1\u20133% of cancers identified
    in this way. \n\nGallbladder polyps are mostly benign growths or lesions resembling
    growths that form in the gallbladder wall, and are only associated with cancer
    when they are larger in size (>1 cm). \n\nCholesterol polyps, often associated
    with cholesterolosis (\"strawberry gallbladder\", a change in the gallbladder
    wall due to excess cholesterol), often cause no symptoms and are thus often detected
    in this way.\n\n\n=== Tests ===\n\n\nTests used to investigate for gallbladder
    disease include blood tests and medical imaging. \n\nA full blood count may reveal
    an increased white cell count suggestive of inflammation or infection. \n\nTests
    such as bilirubin and liver function tests may reveal if there is inflammation
    linked to the biliary tree or gallbladder, and whether this is associated with
    inflammation of the liver, and a lipase or amylase may be elevated if there is
    pancreatitis. \n\nBilirubin may rise when there is obstruction of the flow of
    bile. \n\nA CA 19-9 level may be taken to investigate for cholangiocarcinoma.An
    ultrasound is often the first medical imaging test performed when gallbladder
    disease such as gallstones are suspected. \n\nAn abdominal X-ray or CT scan is
    another form of imaging that may be used to examine the gallbladder and surrounding
    organs. \n\nOther imaging options include MRCP (magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography),
    ERCP and percutaneous or intraoperative cholangiography. \n\nA cholescintigraphy
    scan is a nuclear imaging procedure used to assess the condition of the gallbladder.\n\n\n==
    Other animals ==\n\nMost vertebrates have gallbladders, but the form and arrangement
    of the bile ducts may vary considerably. \n\nIn many species, for example, there
    are several separate ducts running to the intestine, rather than the single common
    bile duct found in humans. \n\nSeveral species of mammals (including horses,
    deer, rats, and laminoids), several species of birds (such as pigeons and some
    psittacine species), lampreys and all invertebrates do not have a gallbladder
    .\n\nThe bile from several species of bears is used in traditional Chinese medicine;
    bile bears are kept alive in captivity while their bile is extracted, in an industry
    characterized by animal cruelty.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nDepictions of the gallbladder
    and biliary tree are found in Babylonian models found from 2000 BCE, and in ancient
    Etruscan model from 200 BCE, with models associated with divine worship.\n\nDiseases
    of the gallbladder are known to have existed in humans since antiquity, with
    gallstones found in the mummy of Princess Amenen of Thebes dating to 1500 BCE.
    \n\nSome historians believe the death of Alexander the Great may have been associated
    with an acute episode of cholecystitis. \n\nThe existence of the gallbladder
    has been noted since the 5th century, but it is only relatively recently that
    the function and the diseases of the gallbladder has been documented, particularly
    in the last two centuries.\n\nThe first descriptions of gallstones appear to
    have been in the Renaissance, perhaps because of the low incidence of gallstones
    in earlier times owing to a diet with more cereals and vegetables and less meat.
    \n\nAnthonius Benevinius in 1506 was the first to draw a connection between symptoms
    and the presence of gallstones. \n\nLudwig Georg Courvoisier, after examining
    a number of cases in 1890 that gave rise to the eponymous Courvoisier's law,
    stated that in an enlarged, nontender gallbladder, the cause of jaundice is unlikely
    to be gallstones.\n\nThe first surgical removal of a gallstone (cholecystolithotomy)
    was in 1676 by physician Joenisius, who removed the stones from a spontaneously
    occurring biliary fistula. \n\nStough Hobbs in 1867 performed the first recorded
    cholecystotomy, although such an operation was in fact described earlier by French
    surgeon Jean Louis Petit in the mid eighteenth century. \n\nGerman surgeon Carl
    Langenbuch performed the first cholecystectomy in 1882 for a sufferer of cholelithiasis.
    \n\nBefore this, surgery had focused on creating a fistula for drainage of gallstones.
    \n\nLangenbuch reasoned that given several other species of mammal have no gallbladder,
    humans could survive without one.\n\nThe debate whether surgical removal of the
    gallbladder or simply gallstones was preferred was settled in the 1920s, with
    the consensus that removal of the gallbladder was preferred. \n\nIt was only
    in the mid and late parts of the twentieth century that medical imaging techniques
    such as use of contrast medium and CT scans were used to view the gallbladder.
    \n\nThe first laparoscopic cholecystectomy performed by Erich M\xFChe of Germany
    in 1985, although French surgeons Phillipe Mouret and Francois Dubois are often
    credited for their operations in 1987 and 1988 respectively.\n\n\n== Society
    and culture ==\n\nTo have \"gall\" is associated with bold behaviour, whereas
    to have \"bile\" is associated with bitterness.\n\nIn the Chinese language, the
    gallbladder (Chinese: \u81BD) is associated with courage and a myriad of related
    idioms, including using terms such as \"a body completely [of] gall\" (Chinese:
    \u6E3E\u8EAB\u662F\u81BD) to describe a brave person, and \"single gallbladder
    hero\" (Chinese: \u5B64\u81BD\u82F1\u96C4) to describe a lone hero.In the Zangfu
    theory of Chinese medicine, the gallbladder not only has a digestive role, but
    is seen as the seat of decision-making.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallbladder"

  descriptionText: "\n\nPANCREAS\n\n\nThe pancreas is an organ of the digestive system
    and endocrine system of vertebrates. \n\nIn humans, it is located in the abdomen
    behind the stomach and functions as a gland. \n\nThe pancreas is a mixed or heterocrine
    gland, i.e. it has both an endocrine and a digestive exocrine function. 99% of
    the pancreas is exocrine and 1% is endocrine. \n\nAs an endocrine gland, it functions
    mostly to regulate blood sugar levels, secreting the hormones insulin, glucagon,
    somatostatin, and pancreatic polypeptide. \n\nAs a part of the digestive system,
    it functions as an exocrine gland secreting pancreatic juice into the duodenum
    through the pancreatic duct. \n\nThis juice contains bicarbonate, which neutralizes
    acid entering the duodenum from the stomach; and digestive enzymes, which break
    down carbohydrates, proteins, and fats in food entering the duodenum from the
    stomach.\nInflammation of the pancreas is known as pancreatitis, with common
    causes including chronic alcohol use and gallstones. \n\nBecause of its role
    in the regulation of blood sugar, the pancreas is also a key organ in diabetes
    mellitus. \n\nPancreatic cancer can arise following chronic pancreatitis or due
    to other reasons, and carries a very poor prognosis, as it is often identified
    when it has spread to other areas of the body.\nThe word pancreas comes from
    the Greek \u03C0\u1FB6\u03BD (p\xE2n, \u201Call\u201D) & \u03BA\u03C1\u03AD\u03B1\u03C2
    (kr\xE9as, \u201Cflesh\u201D). \n\nThe function of the pancreas in diabetes has
    been known since at least 1889, with its role in insulin production identified
    in 1921.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\n\nThe pancreas is an organ that in humans lies
    in the abdomen, stretching from behind the stomach to the left upper abdomen
    near the spleen. \n\nIn adults, it is about 12\u201315 centimetres (4.7\u20135.9
    in) long, lobulated, and salmon-coloured in appearance.Anatomically, the pancreas
    is divided into a head, neck, body, and tail. \n\nThe pancreas stretches from
    the inner curvature of the duodenum, where the head surrounds two blood vessels:
    the superior mesenteric artery, and vein. \n\nThe longest part of the pancreas,
    the body, stretches across behind the stomach, and the tail of the pancreas ends
    adjacent to the spleen.Two ducts, the main pancreatic duct and a smaller accessory
    pancreatic duct run through the body of the pancreas. \n\nThe main pancreatic
    duct joins with the common bile duct forming a small ballooning called the ampulla
    of Vater (hepatopancreatic ampulla). \n\nThis ampulla is surrounded by a muscle,
    the sphincter of Oddi. \n\nThis ampulla opens into the descending part of the
    duodenum. \n\nThe opening of the common bile duct into main pancreatic duct is
    controlled by sphincter of Boyden. \n\nThe accessory pancreatic duct opens into
    duodenum with separate openings located above the opening of the main pancreatic
    duct.\n\n\n=== Parts ===\n\nThe head of the pancreas sits within the curvature
    of the duodenum, and wraps around the superior mesenteric artery and vein. \n\nTo
    the right sits the descending part of the duodenum, and between these travel
    the superior and inferior pancreaticoduodenal arteries. \n\nBehind rests the
    inferior vena cava, and the common bile duct. \n\nIn front sits the peritoneal
    membrane and the transverse colon. \n\nA small uncinate process emerges from
    below the head, situated behind the superior mesenteric vein and sometimes artery.The
    neck of the pancreas separates the head of the pancreas, located in the curvature
    of the duodenum, from the body. \n\nThe neck is about 2 cm (0.79 in) wide, and
    sits in front of where the portal vein is formed. \n\nThe neck lies mostly behind
    the pylorus of the stomach, and is covered with peritoneum. \n\nThe anterior
    superior pancreaticoduodenal artery travels in front of the neck of the pancreas.The
    body is the largest part of the pancreas, and mostly lies behind the stomach,
    tapering along its length. \n\nThe peritoneum sits on top of the body of the
    pancreas, and the transverse colon in front of the peritoneum. \n\nBehind the
    pancreas are several blood vessels, including the aorta, the splenic vein, and
    the left renal vein, as well as the beginning of the superior mesenteric artery.
    \n\nBelow the body of the pancreas sits some of the small intestine, specifically
    the last part of the duodenum and the jejunum to which it connects, as well as
    the suspensory ligament of the duodenum which falls between these two. \n\nIn
    front of the pancreas sits the transverse colon.The pancreas narrows towards
    the tail, which sits near to the spleen. \n\nIt is usually between 1.3\u20133.5
    cm (0.51\u20131.38 in) long, and sits between the layers of the ligament between
    the spleen and the left kidney. \n\nThe splenic artery and vein, which also passes
    behind the body of the pancreas, pass behind the tail of the pancreas.\n\n\n===
    Blood supply ===\n\nThe pancreas has a rich blood supply, with vessels originating
    as branches of both the coeliac artery and superior mesenteric artery. \n\nThe
    splenic artery runs along the top of the pancreas, and supplies the left part
    of the body and the tail of the pancreas through its pancreatic branches, the
    largest of which is called the greater pancreatic artery. \n\nThe superior and
    inferior pancreaticoduodenal arteries run along the back and front surfaces of
    the head of the pancreas adjacent to the duodenum. \n\nThese supply the head
    of the pancreas. \n\nThese vessels join together (anastamose) in the middle.The
    body and neck of the pancreas drain into the splenic vein, which sits behind
    the pancreas. \n\nThe head drains into, and wraps around, the superior mesenteric
    and portal veins, via the pancreaticoduodenal veins.The pancreas drains into
    lymphatic vessels that travel alongside its arteries, and has a rich lymphatic
    supply. \n\nThe lymphatic vessels of the body and tail drain into splenic lymph
    nodes, and eventually into lymph nodes that lie in front of the aorta, between
    the coeliac and superior mesenteric arteries. \n\nThe lymphatic vessels of the
    head and neck drain into intermediate lymphatic vessels around the pancreaticoduodenal,
    mesenteric and hepatic arteries, and from there into the lymph nodes that lie
    in front of the aorta.\n\n\n=== Microanatomy ===\n\n\nThe pancreas contains tissue
    with an endocrine and exocrine role, and this division is also visible when the
    pancreas is viewed under a microscope.The majority of pancreatic tissue has a
    digestive role. \n\nThe cells with this role form clusters (Latin: acini) around
    small ducts, and are arranged in lobes that have thin fibrous walls. \n\nThe
    cells of each acinus secrete inactive digestive enzymes called zymogens into
    the small intercalated ducts which they surround. \n\nIn each acinus, the cells
    are pyramid-shaped and situated around the intercalated ducts, with the nuclei
    resting on the basement membrane, a large endoplasmic reticulum, and a number
    of zymogen granules visible within the cytoplasm. \n\nThe intercalated ducts
    drain into larger intralobular ducts within the lobule, and finally interlobular
    ducts. \n\nThe ducts are lined by a single layer of column-shaped cells. \n\nThere
    is more than one layer of cells as the diameter of the ducts increases.The tissues
    with an endocrine role within the pancreas exist as clusters of cells called
    pancreatic islets (also called islets of Langerhans) that are distributed throughout
    the pancreas. \n\nPancreatic islets contain alpha cells, beta cells, and delta
    cells, each of which releases a different hormone. \n\nThese cells have characteristic
    positions, with alpha cells (secreting glucagon) tending to be situated around
    the periphery of the islet, and beta cells (secreting insulin) more numerous
    and found throughout the islet. \n\nEnterochromaffin cells are also scattered
    throughout the islets. \n\nIslets are composed of up to 3,000 secretory cells,
    and contain several small arterioles to receive blood, and venules that allow
    the hormones secreted by the cells to enter the systemic circulation.\n\n\n===
    Variation ===\n\nThe size of the pancreas varies considerably. \n\nSeveral anatomical
    variations exist, relating to the embryological development of the two pancreatic
    buds. \n\nThe pancreas develops from these buds on either side of the duodenum.
    \n\nThe ventral bud rotates to lie next to the dorsal bud, eventually fusing.
    \n\nIn about 10% of adults, an accessory pancreatic duct may be present if the
    main duct of the dorsal bud of the pancreas does not regress; this duct opens
    into the minor duodenal papilla. \n\nIf the two buds themselves, each having
    a duct, do not fuse, a pancreas may exist with two separate ducts, a condition
    known as a pancreas divisum. \n\nThis condition has no physiologic consequence.
    \n\nIf the ventral bud does not fully rotate, an annular pancreas may exist,
    where part or all of the duodenum is encircled by the pancreas. \n\nThis may
    be associated with duodenal atresia.\n\n\n=== Gene and protein expression ===\n\n\n10,000
    protein coding genes (50% of all genes) are expressed in the normal human pancreas.
    \n\nLess than 100 of these genes are specifically expressed in the pancreas.
    \n\nSimilar to the salivary glands, most pancreas-specific genes encode for secreted
    proteins. \n\nCorresponding pancreas-specific proteins are either expressed in
    the exocrine cellular compartment and have functions related to digestion or
    food uptake such as digestive chymotrypsinogen enzymes and pancreatic lipase
    PNLIP, or are expressed in the various cells of the endocrine pancreatic islets
    and have functions related to secreted hormones such as insulin, glucagon, somatostatin
    and pancreatic polypeptide.\n\n\n== Development ==\n\n\nThe pancreas forms during
    development from two buds that arise from the duodenal part of the foregut, an
    embryonic tube that is a precursor to the gastrointestinal tract. \n\nIt is of
    endodermal origin. \n\nPancreatic development begins with the formation of a
    dorsal and ventral pancreatic bud. \n\nEach joins with the foregut through a
    duct. \n\nThe dorsal pancreatic bud forms the neck, body, and tail of the developed
    pancreas, and the ventral pancreatic bud forms the head and uncinate process.The
    definitive pancreas results from rotation of the ventral bud and the fusion of
    the two buds. \n\nDuring development, the duodenum rotates to the right, and
    the ventral bud rotates with it, moving to a position that becomes more dorsal.
    \n\nUpon reaching its final destination, the ventral pancreatic bud is below
    the larger dorsal bud, and eventually fuses with it. \n\nAt this point of fusion,
    the main ducts of the ventral and dorsal pancreatic buds fuse, forming the main
    pancreatic duct. \n\nUsually, the duct of the dorsal bud regresses, leaving the
    main pancreatic duct.\n\n\n=== Cellular development ===\n\nPancreatic progenitor
    cells are precursor cells that differentiate into the functional pancreatic cells,
    including exocrine acinar cells, endocrine islet cells, and ductal cells. \n\nThese
    progenitor cells are characterised by the co-expression of the transcription
    factors PDX1 and NKX6-1.The cells of the exocrine pancreas differentiate through
    molecules that induce differentiation including follistatin, fibroblast growth
    factors, and activation of the Notch receptor system. \n\nDevelopment of the
    exocrine acini progresses through three successive stages. \n\nThese are the
    predifferentiated, protodifferentiated, and differentiated stages, which correspond
    to undetectable, low, and high levels of digestive enzyme activity, respectively.Pancreatic
    progenitor cells differentiate into endocrine islet cells under the influence
    of neurogenin-3 and ISL1, but only in the absence of notch receptor signaling.
    \n\nUnder the direction of a Pax gene, the endocrine precursor cells differentiate
    to form alpha and gamma cells. \n\nUnder the direction of Pax-6, the endocrine
    precursor cells differentiate to form beta and delta cells. \n\nThe pancreatic
    islets form as the endocrine cells migrate from the duct system to form small
    clusters around capillaries. \n\nThis occurs around the third month of development,
    and insulin and glucagon can be detected in the human fetal circulation by the
    fourth or fifth month of development.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\nThe pancreas is
    involved in blood sugar control and metabolism within the body, and also in the
    secretion of substances (collectively pancreatic juice) that help digestion.
    \n\nThese are divided into an \"endocrine\" role, relating to the secretion of
    insulin and other substances within pancreatic islets that help control blood
    sugar levels and metabolism within the body, and an \"exocrine\" role, relating
    to the secretion of enzymes involved in digesting substances in the digestive
    tract.\n\n\n=== Blood glucose regulation ===\n\n\nCells within the pancreas help
    to maintain blood glucose levels (homeostasis). \n\nThe cells that do this are
    located within the pancreatic islets that are present throughout the pancreas.
    \n\nWhen blood glucose levels are low, alpha cells secrete glucagon, which increases
    blood glucose levels. \n\nWhen blood glucose levels are high beta cells secrete
    insulin to decrease glucose in blood. \n\nDelta cells in the islet also secrete
    somatostatin which decreases the release of insulin and glucagon.Glucagon acts
    to increase glucose levels by promoting the creation of glucose and the breakdown
    of glycogen to glucose in the liver. \n\nIt also decreases the uptake of glucose
    in fat and muscle. \n\nGlucagon release is stimulated by low blood glucose or
    insulin levels, and during exercise. \n\nInsulin acts to decrease blood glucose
    levels by facilitating uptake by cells (particularly skeletal muscle), and promoting
    its use in the creation of proteins, fats and carbohydrates. \n\nInsulin is initially
    created as a precursor form called preproinsulin. \n\nThis is converted to proinsulin
    and cleaved by C-peptide to insulin which is then stored in granules in beta
    cells. \n\nGlucose is taken into the beta cells and degraded. \n\nThe end effect
    of this is to cause depolarisation of the cell membrane which stimulates the
    release of the insulin.The main factor influencing the secretion of insulin and
    glucagon are the levels of glucose in blood plasma. \n\nLow blood sugar stimulates
    glucagon release, and high blood sugar stimulates insulin release. \n\nOther
    factors also influence the secretion of these hormones. \n\nSome amino acids,
    that are byproducts of the digestion of protein, stimulate insulin and glucagon
    release. \n\nSomatostatin acts as an inhibitor of both insulin and glucagon.
    \n\nThe autonomic nervous system also plays a role. \n\nActivation of Beta-2
    receptors of the sympathetic nervous system by catecholamines secreted from sympathetic
    nerves stimulates secretion of insulin and glucagon, whereas activation of Alpha-1
    receptors inhibits secretion. \n\nM3 receptors of the parasympathetic nervous
    system act when stimulated by the right vagus nerve to stimulate release of insulin
    from beta cells.\n\n\n=== Digestion ===\n\n\nThe pancreas plays a vital role
    in the digestive system. \n\nIt does this by secreting a fluid that contains
    digestive enzymes into the duodenum, the first part of the small intestine that
    receives food from the stomach. \n\nThese enzymes help to break down carbohydrates,
    proteins and lipids (fats). \n\nThis role is called the \"exocrine\" role of
    the pancreas. \n\nThe cells that do this are arranged in clusters called acini.
    \n\nSecretions into the middle of the acinus accumulate in intralobular ducts,
    which drain to the main pancreatic duct, which drains directly into the duodenum.
    \n\nAbout 1.5 - 3 liters of fluid are secreted in this manner every day.The cells
    in each acinus are filled with granules containing the digestive enzymes. \n\nThese
    are secreted in an inactive form termed zymogens or proenzymes. \n\nWhen released
    into the duodenum, they are activated by the enzyme enterokinase present in the
    lining of the duodenum. \n\nThe proenzymes are cleaved, creating a cascade of
    activating enzymes.\nEnzymes that break down proteins begin with activation of
    trypsinogen to trypsin. \n\nThe free trypsin then cleaves the rest of the trypsinogen,
    as well as chymotrypsinogen to its active form chymotrypsin.\nEnzymes secreted
    involved in the digestion of fats include lipase, phospholipase A2, lysophospholipase,
    and cholesterol esterase.\nEnzymes that break down starch and other carbohydrates
    include amylase.These enzymes are secreted in a fluid rich in bicarbonate. \n\nBicarbonate
    helps maintain an alkaline pH for the fluid, a pH in which most of the enzymes
    act most efficiently, and also helps to neutralise the stomach acids that enter
    the duodenum. \n\nSecretion is influenced by hormones including secretin, cholecystokinin,
    and VIP, as well as acetylcholine stimulation from the vagus nerve. \n\nSecretin
    is released from the S cells which form part of the lining of the duodenum in
    response to stimulation by gastric acid. \n\nAlong with VIP, it increases the
    secretion of enzymes and bicarbonate. \n\nCholecystokinin is released from Ito
    cells of the lining of the duodenum and jejunum mostly in response to long chain
    fatty acids, and increases the effects of secretin. \n\nAt a cellular level,
    bicarbonate is secreted from the acinar cells through a sodium and bicarbonate
    cotransporter that acts because of membrane depolarisation caused by the cystic
    fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator. \n\nSecretin and VIP act to increase
    the opening of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, which
    leads to more membrane depolarisation and more secretion of bicarbonate.A variety
    of mechanisms act to ensure that the digestive action of the pancreas does not
    act to digest pancreatic tissue itself. \n\nThese include the secretion of inactive
    enzymes (zymogens), the secretion of the protective enzyme trypsin inhibitor,
    which inactivates trypsin, the changes in pH that occur with bicarbonate secretion
    that stimulate digestion only when the pancreas is stimulated, and the fact that
    the low calcium within cells causes inactivation of trypsin.\n\n\n=== Additional
    functions ===\n\nThe pancreas also secretes vasoactive intestinal peptide and
    pancreatic polypeptide. \n\nEnterochromaffin cells of the pancreas secrete the
    hormones motilin, serotonin, and substance P.\n\n\n== Clinical significance ==\n\n\n\n===
    Inflammation ===\n\n\nInflammation of the pancreas is known as pancreatitis.
    \n\nPancreatitis is most often associated with recurrent gallstones or chronic
    alcohol use, with other common causes including traumatic damage, damage following
    an ERCP, some medications, infections such as mumps and very high blood triglyceride
    levels. \n\nAcute pancreatitis is likely to cause intense pain in the central
    abdomen, that often radiates to the back, and may be associated with nausea or
    vomiting. \n\nSevere pancreatitis may lead to bleeding or perforation of the
    pancreas resulting in shock or a systemic inflammatory response syndrome, bruising
    of the flanks or the region around the belly button. \n\nThese severe complications
    are often managed in an intensive care unit.In pancreatitis, enzymes of the exocrine
    pancreas damage the structure and tissue of the pancreas. \n\nDetection of some
    of these enzymes, such as amylase and lipase in the blood, along with symptoms
    and findings on medical imaging such as ultrasound or a CT scan, are often used
    to indicate that a person has pancreatitis. \n\nPancreatitis is often managed
    medically with pain reliefs, and monitoring to prevent or manage shock, and management
    of any identified underlying causes. \n\nThis may include removal of gallstones,
    lowering of blood triglyceride or glucose levels, the use of corticosteroids
    for autoimmune pancreatitis, and the cessation of any medication triggers.Chronic
    pancreatitis refers to the development of pancreatitis over time. \n\nIt shares
    many similar causes, with the most common being chronic alcohol use, with other
    causes including recurrent acute episodes and cystic fibrosis. \n\nAbdominal
    pain, characteristically relieved by sitting forward or drinking alcohol, is
    the most common symptom. \n\nWhen the digestive function of the pancreas is severely
    affected, this may lead to problems with fat digestion and the development of
    steatorrhoea; when the endocrine function is affected, this may lead to diabetes.
    \n\nChronic pancreatitis is investigated in a similar way to acute pancreatitis.
    \n\nIn addition to management of pain and nausea, and management of any identified
    causes (which may include alcohol cessation), because of the digestive role of
    the pancreas, enzyme replacement may be needed to prevent malabsorption.\n\n\n===
    Cancer ===\n\n\nPancreatic cancers, particularly the most common type, pancreatic
    adenocarcinoma, remain very difficult to treat, and are mostly diagnosed only
    at a stage that is too late for surgery, which is the only curative treatment.
    \n\nPancreatic cancer is rare in people younger than 40 and the median age of
    diagnosis is 71. \n\nRisk factors include chronic pancreatitis, older age, smoking,
    obesity, diabetes, and certain rare genetic conditions including multiple endocrine
    neoplasia type 1, hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer and dysplastic nevus syndrome
    among others. \n\nAbout 25% of cases are attributable to tobacco smoking, while
    5\u201310% of cases are linked to inherited genes.Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is
    the most common form of pancreatic cancer, and is cancer arising from the exocrine
    digestive part of the pancreas. \n\nMost occur in the head of the pancreas. \n\nSymptoms
    tend to arise late in the course of the cancer, when it causes abdominal pain,
    weight loss, or yellowing of the skin (jaundice). \n\nJaundice occurs when the
    outflow of bile is blocked by the cancer. \n\nOther less common symptoms include
    nausea, vomiting, pancreatitis, diabetes or recurrent venous thrombosis. \n\nPancreatic
    cancer is usually diagnosed by medical imaging in the form of an ultrasound or
    CT scan with contrast enhancement. \n\nAn endoscopic ultrasound may be used if
    a tumour is being considered for surgical removal, and biopsy guided by ERCP
    or ultrasound can be used to confirm an uncertain diagnosis.Because of the late
    development of symptoms, most cancer presents at an advanced stage. \n\nOnly
    10 to 15% of tumours are suitable for surgical resection. \n\nAs of 2018, when
    chemotherapy is given the FOLFIRINOX regimen containing fluorouracil, irinotecan,
    oxaliplatin and leucovorin has been shown to extend survival beyond traditional
    gemcitabine regimens. \n\nFor the most part, treatment is palliative, focus on
    the management of symptoms that develop. \n\nThis may include management of itch,
    a choledochojejunostomy or the insertion of stents with ERCP to facilitate the
    drainage of bile, and medications to help control pain. \n\nIn the United States
    pancreatic cancer is the fourth most common cause of deaths due to cancer. \n\nThe
    disease occurs more often in the developed world, which had 68% of new cases
    in 2012. \n\nPancreatic adenocarcinoma typically has poor outcomes with the average
    percentage alive for at least one and five years after diagnosis being 25% and
    5% respectively. \n\nIn localized disease where the cancer is small (< 2 cm)
    the number alive at five years is approximately 20%.There are several types of
    pancreatic cancer, involving both the endocrine and exocrine tissue. \n\nThe
    many types of pancreatic endocrine tumors are all uncommon or rare, and have
    varied outlooks. \n\nHowever the incidence of these cancers has been rising sharply;
    it is not clear to what extent this reflects increased detection, especially
    through medical imaging, of tumors that would be very slow to develop. \n\nInsulinomas
    (largely benign) and gastrinomas are the most common types. \n\nFor those with
    neuroendocrine cancers the number alive after five years is much better at 65%,
    varying considerably with type.A solid pseudopapillary tumour is a low-grade
    malignant tumour of the pancreas of papillary architecture that typically afflicts
    young women.\n\n\n=== Diabetes mellitus ===\n\n\n\n==== Type 1 diabetes ====\n\nDiabetes
    mellitus type 1 is a chronic autoimmune disease in which the immune system attacks
    the insulin-secreting beta cells of the pancreas. \n\nInsulin is needed to keep
    blood sugar levels within optimal ranges, and its lack can lead to high blood
    sugar. \n\nAs an untreated chronic condition, complications including accelerated
    vascular disease, diabetic retinopathy, kidney disease and neuropathy can result.
    \n\nIn addition, if there is not enough insulin for glucose to be used within
    cells, the medical emergency diabetic ketoacidosis, which is often the first
    symptom that a person with type 1 diabetes may have, can result. \n\nType 1 diabetes
    can develop at any age but is most often diagnosed before age 40. \n\nFor people
    living with type 1 diabetes, insulin injections are critical for survival. \n\nAn
    experimental procedure to treat type 1 diabetes is pancreas transplantation or
    isolated transplantation of islet cells to supply a person with functioning beta
    cells.\n\n\n==== Type 2 diabetes ====\n\nDiabetes mellitus type 2 is the most
    common form of diabetes. \n\nThe causes for high blood sugar in this form of
    diabetes usually are a combination of insulin resistance and impaired insulin
    secretion, with both genetic and environmental factors playing a role in the
    development of the disease. \n\nOver time, pancreatic beta cells may become \"exhausted\"
    and less functional. \n\nThe management of type 2 diabetes involves a combination
    of lifestyle measures, medications if required and potentially insulin. \nWith
    relevance to the pancreas, several medications act to enhance the secretion of
    insulin from beta cells, particularly sulphonylureas, which act directly on beta
    cells; incretins which replicate the action of the hormones glucagon-like peptide
    1, increasing the secretion of insulin from beta cells after meals, and are more
    resistant to breakdown; and DPP-4 inhibitors, which slow the breakdown of incretins.\n\n\n===
    Removal ===\n\nIt is possible for a person to live without a pancreas, provided
    that the person takes insulin for proper regulation of blood glucose concentration
    and pancreatic enzyme supplements to aid digestion.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe
    pancreas was first identified by Herophilus (335\u2013280 BC), a Greek anatomist
    and surgeon. \n\nA few hundred years later, Rufus of Ephesus, another Greek anatomist,
    gave the pancreas its name. \n\nEtymologically, the term \"pancreas\", a modern
    Latin adaptation of Greek \u03C0\u03AC\u03B3\u03BA\u03C1\u03B5\u03B1\u03C2, [\u03C0\u1FB6\u03BD
    (\"all\", \"whole\"), and \u03BA\u03C1\u03AD\u03B1\u03C2 (\"flesh\")], originally
    means sweetbread, although literally meaning all-flesh, presumably because of
    its fleshy consistency. \n\nIt was only in 1889 when Oskar Minkowski discovered
    that removing the pancreas from a dog caused it to become diabetic. \n\nInsulin
    was later isolated from pancreatic islets by Frederick Banting and Charles Herbert
    Best in 1921.The way the tissue of the pancreas has been viewed has also changed.
    \n\nPreviously, it was viewed using simple staining methods such as H&E stains.
    \n\nNow, immunohistochemistry can be used to more easily differentiate cell types.
    \n\nThis involves visible antibodies to the products of certain cell types, and
    helps identify with greater ease cell types such as alpha and beta cells.\n\n\n==
    Other animals ==\n\nPancreatic tissue is present in all vertebrates, but its
    precise form and arrangement varies widely. \n\nThere may be up to three separate
    pancreases, two of which arise from ventral buds, and the other dorsally. \n\nIn
    most species (including humans), these \"fuse\" in the adult, but there are several
    exceptions. \n\nEven when a single pancreas is present, two or three pancreatic
    ducts may persist, each draining separately into the duodenum (or equivalent
    part of the foregut). \n\nBirds, for example, typically have three such ducts.In
    teleost fish, and a few other species (such as rabbits), there is no discrete
    pancreas at all, with pancreatic tissue being distributed diffusely across the
    mesentery and even within other nearby organs, such as the liver or spleen. \n\nIn
    a few teleost species, the endocrine tissue has fused to form a distinct gland
    within the abdominal cavity, but otherwise it is distributed among the exocrine
    components. \n\nThe most primitive arrangement, however, appears to be that of
    lampreys and lungfish, in which pancreatic tissue is found as a number of discrete
    nodules within the wall of the gut itself, with the exocrine portions being little
    different from other glandular structures of the intestine.\n\n\n== Cuisine ==\n\nThe
    pancreas of calf (ris de veau) or lamb (ris d'agneau), and, less commonly, of
    beef or pork, are used as food under the culinary name of sweetbread.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas"

  descriptionText: "\n\nEJACULATORY DUCT\n\n\nThe ejaculatory ducts (ductus ejaculatorii)
    are paired structures in male anatomy. \n\nEach ejaculatory duct is formed by
    the union of the vas deferens with the duct of the seminal vesicle. \n\nThey
    pass through the prostate, and open into the urethra above the seminal colliculus.
    \n\nDuring ejaculation, semen passes through the prostate gland, enters the urethra
    and exits the body via the urinary meatus.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\n\n\n=== Ejaculation
    ===\n\n\nEjaculation occurs in two stages, the emission stage and the expulsion
    stage. \n\nThe emission stage involves the workings of several structures of
    the ejaculatory duct; contractions of the prostate gland, the seminal vesicles,
    the bulbourethral gland and the vas deferens push fluids into the prostatic urethra.
    \n\nThe semen is stored here until ejaculation occurs. \n\nMuscles at the base
    of the penis contract in order to propel the seminal fluid trapped in the prostatic
    urethra through the penile urethra and expel it through the urinary meatus. \n\nThe
    ejaculate is expelled in spurts, due to the movement of the muscles propelling
    it. \n\nThese muscle contractions are related to the sensations of orgasm for
    the male.Sperm is produced in the testes and enters the ejaculatory ducts via
    the vas deferens. \n\nAs it passes by the seminal vesicles, a fluid rich in fructose
    combines with sperm. \n\nThis addition nourishes the sperm in order to keep it
    active and motile. \n\nSeminal fluid continues down the ejaculatory duct into
    the prostate gland, where an alkaline prostatic fluid is added. \n\nThis addition
    provides the texture and odor associated with semen. \n\nThe alkalinity of the
    prostatic fluid serves to neutralize the acidity of the female vaginal tract
    in order to prolong the survival of sperm in this harsh environment. \n\nSemen
    is now a fructose-rich, alkaline fluid containing sperm as it enters the bulbourethral
    glands below the prostate. \n\nThe bulbourethral glands secrete a small amount
    of clear fluid into the urethra before the ejaculate is expelled. \n\nThe functions
    of this fluid are not entirely known but are suggested to aid in lubricating
    the male urethra in preparation for the semen during ejaculation. \n\nThe amount
    of semen produced and expelled during ejaculation corresponds to the length of
    time that the male is sexually aroused before ejaculation occurs. \n\nGenerally,
    the longer the period of arousal, the larger the amount of seminal fluid.Ejaculation
    and orgasm may occur simultaneously, however they are not coupled, in that one
    may occur without the other. \n\nFor example, a man may have a dry orgasm (termed
    Retrograde ejaculation); there is no expulsion of ejaculate however the man still
    experiences orgasm. \n\nAlso, paraplegics may ejaculate seminal fluid but not
    experience the sensation of orgasm.\n\n\n== Clinical relevance ==\n\n\n\n===
    Ejaculatory duct obstruction ===\n\n\nEjaculatory duct obstruction is an acquired
    or congenital pathological condition in which one or both ejaculatory ducts are
    obstructed. \n\nIn the case that both ejaculatory ducts are obstructed, this
    illness presents with the symptoms of aspermia and male infertility.,\n\n\n===
    Benign prostatic hyperplasia ===\n\n\nSurgery to correct benign prostatic hyperplasia
    may destroy these ducts resulting in retrograde ejaculation. \n\nRetrograde ejaculation
    empties the seminal fluid formed in the emission phase into the bladder of the
    male instead of expelling it through the urethra and out the tip of the penis.
    \n\nThis results in a dry orgasm, where orgasm may still be experienced but without
    expulsion of semen from the ejaculatory ducts.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejaculatory_duct"

  descriptionText: "\n\nINFERIOR LOBE OF RIGHT LUNG/\nLUNG\n\n\nThe lungs are the
    primary organs of the respiratory system in humans and most other animals including
    a few fish, and some snails. \n\nIn mammals and most other vertebrates, two lungs
    are located near the backbone on either side of the heart. \n\nTheir function
    in the respiratory system is to extract oxygen from the air and transfer it into
    the bloodstream, and to release carbon dioxide from the bloodstream into the
    atmosphere, in a process of gas exchange. \n\nRespiration is driven by different
    muscular systems in different species. \n\nMammals, reptiles and birds use their
    different muscles to support and foster breathing. \n\nIn earlier tetrapods,
    air was driven into the lungs by the pharyngeal muscles via buccal pumping, a
    mechanism still seen in amphibians. \n\nIn humans, the main muscle of respiration
    that drives breathing is the diaphragm. \n\nThe lungs also provide airflow that
    makes vocal sounds including human speech possible.\nHumans have two lungs, a
    right lung, and a left lung. \n\nThey are situated within the thoracic cavity
    of the chest. \n\nThe right lung is bigger than the left, which shares space
    in the chest with the heart. \n\nThe lungs together weigh approximately 1.3 kilograms
    (2.9 lb), and the right is heavier. \n\nThe lungs are part of the lower respiratory
    tract that begins at the trachea and branches into the bronchi and bronchioles,
    and which receive air breathed in via the conducting zone. \n\nThe conducting
    zone ends at the terminal bronchioles. \n\nThese divide into the respiratory
    bronchioles of the respiratory zone which divide into alveolar ducts that give
    rise to the alveolar sacs that contain the alveoli, where gas exchange takes
    place. \n\nAlveoli are also sparsely present on the walls of the respiratory
    bronchioles and alveolar ducts. \n\nTogether, the lungs contain approximately
    2,400 kilometres (1,500 mi) of airways and 300 to 500 million alveoli. \n\nEach
    lung is enclosed within a pleural sac of two membranes called pleurae; the membranes
    are separated by a film of pleural fluid, which allows the inner and outer membranes
    to slide over each other whilst breathing takes place, without much friction.
    \n\nThe inner pleura also divides each lung into sections called lobes. \n\nThe
    right lung has three lobes and the left has two. \n\nThe lobes are further divided
    into bronchopulmonary segments and pulmonary lobules. \n\nThe lungs have a unique
    blood supply, receiving deoxygenated blood from the heart in the pulmonary circulation
    for the purposes of receiving oxygen and releasing carbon dioxide, and a separate
    supply of oxygenated blood to the tissue of the lungs, in the bronchial circulation.\nThe
    tissue of the lungs can be affected by a number of respiratory diseases, including
    pneumonia and lung cancer. \n\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease includes
    chronic bronchitis and emphysema, and can be related to smoking or exposure to
    harmful substances. \n\nA number of occupational lung diseases can be caused
    by substances such as coal dust, asbestos fibres, and crystalline silica dust.
    \n\nDiseases such as bronchitis can also affect the respiratory tract. \n\nMedical
    terms related to the lung often begin with pulmo-, from the Latin pulmonarius
    (of the lungs) as in pulmonology, or with pneumo- (from Greek \u03C0\u03BD\u03B5\u03CD\u03BC\u03C9\u03BD
    \"lung\") as in pneumonia.\nIn embryonic development, the lungs begin to develop
    as an outpouching of the foregut, a tube which goes on to form the upper part
    of the digestive system. \n\nWhen the lungs are formed the fetus is held in the
    fluid-filled amniotic sac and so they do not function to breathe. \n\nBlood is
    also diverted from the lungs through the ductus arteriosus. \n\nAt birth however,
    air begins to pass through the lungs, and the diversionary duct closes, so that
    the lungs can begin to respire. \n\nThe lungs only fully develop in early childhood.\n\n\n==
    Structure ==\n\n\n\n=== Anatomy ===\n\n\nThe lungs are located in the chest on
    either side of the heart in the rib cage. \n\nThey are conical in shape with
    a narrow rounded apex at the top, and a broad concave base that rests on the
    convex surface of the diaphragm. \n\nThe apex of the lung extends into the root
    of the neck, reaching shortly above the level of the sternal end of the first
    rib. \n\nThe lungs stretch from close to the backbone in the rib cage to the
    front of the chest and downwards from the lower part of the trachea to the diaphragm.
    \n\nThe left lung shares space with the heart, and has an indentation in its
    border called the cardiac notch of the left lung to accommodate this. \n\nThe
    front and outer sides of the lungs face the ribs, which make light indentations
    on their surfaces. \n\nThe medial surfaces of the lungs face towards the centre
    of the chest, and lie against the heart, great vessels, and the carina where
    the trachea divides into the two main bronchi. \n\nThe cardiac impression is
    an indentation formed on the surfaces of the lungs where they rest against the
    heart.\nBoth lungs have a central recession called the hilum at the root of the
    lung, where the blood vessels and airways pass into the lungs. \n\nThere are
    also bronchopulmonary lymph nodes on the hilum.The lungs are surrounded by the
    pulmonary pleurae. \n\nThe pleurae are two serous membranes; the outer parietal
    pleura lines the inner wall of the rib cage and the inner visceral pleura directly
    lines the surface of the lungs. \n\nBetween the pleurae is a potential space
    called the pleural cavity containing a thin layer of lubricating pleural fluid.\n\n\n====
    Lobes ====\nEach lung is divided into sections called lobes by the infoldings
    of the visceral pleura as fissures. \n\nLobes are divided into segments, and
    segments have further divisions as lobules. \n\nThere are three lobes in the
    right lung and two lobes in the left lung. \n\n\n==== Fissures ====\nThe fissures
    are formed in early prenatal development by invaginations of the visceral pleura
    that divide the lobar bronchi, and section the lungs into lobes that helps in
    their expansion. \n\nThe right lung is divided into three lobes by a horizontal
    fissure, and an oblique fissure. \n\nThe left lung is divided into two lobes
    by an oblique fissure which is closely aligned with the oblique fissure in the
    right lung. \n\nIn the right lung the upper horizontal fissure, separates the
    upper (superior) lobe from the middle lobe. \n\nThe lower, oblique fissure separates
    the lower lobe from the middle and upper lobes.Variations in the fissures are
    fairly common being either incompletely formed \nor present as an extra fissure
    as in the azygos fissure, or absent. \n\nIncomplete fissures are responsible
    for interlobar collateral ventilation, airflow between lobes which is unwanted
    in some lung volume reduction procedures.\n\n\n==== Segments ====\nThe main or
    primary bronchi enter the lungs at the hilum and initially branch into secondary
    bronchi also known as lobar bronchi that supply air to each lobe of the lung.
    \n\nThe lobar bronchi branch into tertiary bronchi also known as segmental bronchi
    and these supply air to the further divisions of the lobes known as bronchopulmonary
    segments. \n\nEach bronchopulmonary segment has its own (segmental) bronchus
    and arterial supply. \n\nSegments for the left and right lung are shown in the
    table. \n\nThe segmental anatomy is useful clinically for localising disease
    processes in the lungs. \n\nA segment is a discrete unit that can be surgically
    removed without seriously affecting surrounding tissue.\n\n\n=== Right lung ===\n\nThe
    right lung has both more lobes and segments than the left. \n\nIt is divided
    into three lobes, an upper, middle, and a lower lobe by two fissures, one oblique
    and one horizontal. \n\nThe upper, horizontal fissure, separates the upper from
    the middle lobe. \n\nIt begins in the lower oblique fissure near the posterior
    border of the lung, and, running horizontally forward, cuts the anterior border
    on a level with the sternal end of the fourth costal cartilage; on the mediastinal
    surface it may be traced back to the hilum. \n\nThe lower, oblique fissure, separates
    the lower from the middle and upper lobes and is closely aligned with the oblique
    fissure in the left lung.The mediastinal surface of the right lung is indented
    by a number of nearby structures. \n\nThe heart sits in an impression called
    the cardiac impression. \n\nAbove the hilum of the lung is an arched groove for
    the azygos vein, and above this is a wide groove for the superior vena cava and
    right brachiocephalic vein; behind this, and close to the top of the lung is
    a groove for the brachiocephalic artery. \n\nThere is a groove for the esophagus
    behind the hilum and the pulmonary ligament, and near the lower part of the esophageal
    groove is a deeper groove for the inferior vena cava before it enters the heart.The
    weight of the right lung varies between individuals, with a standard reference
    range in men of 155\u2013720 g (0.342\u20131.587 lb) and in women of 100\u2013590
    g (0.22\u20131.30 lb).\n\n\n=== Left lung ===\n\nThe left lung is divided into
    two lobes, an upper and a lower lobe, by the oblique fissure, which extends from
    the costal to the mediastinal surface of the lung both above and below the hilum.
    \n\nThe left lung, unlike the right, does not have a middle lobe, though it does
    have a homologous feature, a projection of the upper lobe termed the lingula.
    \n\nIts name means \"little tongue\". \n\nThe lingula on the left lung serves
    as an anatomic parallel to the middle lobe on the right lung, with both areas
    being predisposed to similar infections and anatomic complications. \n\nThere
    are two bronchopulmonary segments of the lingula: superior and inferior.The mediastinal
    surface of the left lung has a large cardiac impression where the heart sits.
    \n\nThis is deeper and larger than that on the right lung, at which level the
    heart projects to the left.On the same surface, immediately above the hilum,
    is a well-marked curved groove for the aortic arch, and a groove below it for
    the descending aorta. \n\nThe left subclavian artery, a branch off the aortic
    arch, sits in a groove from the arch to near the apex of the lung. \n\nA shallower
    groove in front of the artery and near the edge of the lung, lodges the left
    brachiocephalic vein. \n\nThe esophagus may sit in a wider shallow impression
    at the base of the lung.The weight of the left lung, by standard reference range,
    in men is 110\u2013675 g (0.243\u20131.488 lb) in women 105\u2013515 g (0.231\u20131.135
    lb).\n\n\n== Microanatomy ==\n\n\nThe lungs are part of the lower respiratory
    tract, and accommodate the bronchial airways when they branch from the trachea.
    \n\nThe bronchial airways terminate in alveoli which make up the functional tissue
    (parenchyma) of the lung, and veins, arteries, nerves, and lymphatic vessels.
    \n\nThe trachea and bronchi have plexuses of lymph capillaries in their mucosa
    and submucosa. \n\nThe smaller bronchi have a single layer of lymph capillaries,
    and they are absent in the alveoli. \n\nThe lungs are supplied with the largest
    lymphatic drainage system of any other organ in the body. \n\nEach lung is surrounded
    by a serous membrane of visceral pleura, which has an underlying layer of loose
    connective tissue attached to the substance of the lung.\n\n\n=== Connective
    tissue ===\n\nThe connective tissue of the lungs is made up of elastic and collagen
    fibres that are interspersed between the capillaries and the alveolar walls.
    \n\nElastin is the key protein of the extracellular matrix and is the main component
    of the elastic fibres. \n\nElastin gives the necessary elasticity and resilience
    required for the persistent stretching involved in breathing, known as lung compliance.
    \n\nIt is also responsible for the elastic recoil needed. \n\nElastin is more
    concentrated in areas of high stress such as the openings of the alveoli, and
    alveolar junctions. \n\nThe connective tissue links all the alveoli to form the
    lung parenchyma which has a sponge-like appearance. \n\nThe alveoli have interconnecting
    air passages in their walls known as the pores of Kohn.\n\n\n=== Respiratory
    epithelium ===\n\n\nAll of the lower respiratory tract including the trachea,
    bronchi, and bronchioles is lined with respiratory epithelium. \n\nThis is a
    ciliated epithelium interspersed with goblet cells which produce mucin the main
    component of mucus, ciliated cells, basal cells, and in the terminal bronchioles\u2013club
    cells with actions similar to basal cells, and macrophages. \n\nThe epithelial
    cells, and the submucosal glands throughout the respiratory tract secrete airway
    surface liquid (ASL), the composition of which is tightly regulated and determines
    how well mucociliary clearance works.Pulmonary neuroendocrine cells are found
    throughout the respiratory epithelium including the alveolar epithelium, though
    they only account for around 0.5 per cent of the total epithelial population.
    \n\nPNECs are innervated airway epithelial cells that are particularly focused
    at airway junction points. \n\nThese cells can produce serotonin, dopamine, and
    norepinephrine, as well as polypeptide products. \n\nCytoplasmic processes from
    the pulmonary neuroendocrine cells extend into the airway lumen where they may
    sense the composition of inspired gas.\n\n\n=== Bronchial airways ===\n\nIn the
    bronchi there are incomplete tracheal rings of cartilage and smaller plates of
    cartilage that keep them open.:\u200A472\u200A Bronchioles are too narrow to
    support cartilage and their walls are of smooth muscle, and this is largely absent
    in the narrower respiratory bronchioles which are mainly just of epithelium.:\u200A472\u200A
    The absence of cartilage in the terminal bronchioles gives them an alternative
    name of membranous bronchioles.\n\n\n=== Respiratory zone ===\n\nThe conducting
    zone of the respiratory tract ends at the terminal bronchioles when they branch
    into the respiratory bronchioles. \n\nThis marks the beginning of the terminal
    respiratory unit called the acinus which includes the respiratory bronchioles,
    the alveolar ducts, alveolar sacs, and alveoli. \n\nAn acinus measures up to
    10 mm in diameter. \n\nA primary pulmonary lobule is that part of the acinus
    that includes the alveolar ducts, sacs, and alveoli but does not include the
    respiratory bronchioles. \n\nThe unit described as the secondary pulmonary lobule
    is the lobule most referred to as the pulmonary lobule or respiratory lobule.:\u200A489\u200A
    This lobule is a discrete unit that is the smallest component of the lung that
    can be seen without aid. \n\nThe secondary pulmonary lobule is likely to be made
    up of between 30 and 50 primary lobules. \n\nThe lobule is supplied by a terminal
    bronchiole that branches into respiratory bronchioles. \n\nThe respiratory bronchioles
    supply the alveoli in each acinus and is accompanied by a pulmonary artery branch.
    \n\nEach lobule is enclosed by an interlobular septa. \n\nEach acinus is incompletely
    separated by an interlobular septa.The respiratory bronchiole gives rise to the
    alveolar ducts that lead to the alveolar sacs, which contain two or more alveoli.
    \n\nThe walls of the alveoli are extremely thin allowing a fast rate of diffusion.
    \n\nThe alveoli have interconnecting small air passages in their walls known
    as the pores of Kohn.\n\n\n=== Alveoli ===\n\n\nAlveoli consist of two types
    of alveolar cell and an alveolar macrophage. \n\nThe two types of cell are known
    as type I and type II cells (also known as pneumocytes). \n\nTypes I and II make
    up the walls and alveolar septa. \n\nType I cells provide 95% of the surface
    area of each alveoli and are flat (\"squamous\"), and Type II cells generally
    cluster in the corners of the alveoli and have a cuboidal shape. \n\nDespite
    this, cells occur in a roughly equal ratio of 1:1 or 6:4.Type I are squamous
    epithelial cells that make up the alveolar wall structure. \n\nThey have extremely
    thin walls that enable an easy gas exchange. \n\nThese type I cells also make
    up the alveolar septa which separate each alveolus. \n\nThe septa consist of
    an epithelial lining and associated basement membranes. \n\nType I cells are
    not able to divide, and consequently rely on differentiation from Type II cells.Type
    II are larger and they line the alveoli and produce and secrete epithelial lining
    fluid, and lung surfactant. \n\nType II cells are able to divide and differentiate
    to Type I cells.The alveolar macrophages have an important role in the immune
    system. \n\nThey remove substances which deposit in the alveoli including loose
    red blood cells that have been forced out from blood vessels.\n\n\n=== Microbiota
    ===\n\n\nThere is a large presence of microorganisms in the lungs known as the
    lung microbiota that interacts with the airway epithelial cells; an interaction
    of probable importance in maintaining homeostasis. \n\nThe microbiota is complex
    and dynamic in healthy people, and altered in diseases such as asthma and COPD.
    \n\nFor example significant changes can take place in COPD following infection
    with rhinovirus. \n\nFungal genera that are commonly found as mycobiota in the
    microbiota include Candida, Malassezia, Saccharomyces, and Aspergillus.\n\n\n===
    Respiratory tract ===\n\n\nThe lower respiratory tract is part of the respiratory
    system, and consists of the trachea and the structures below this including the
    lungs. \n\nThe trachea receives air from the pharynx and travels down to a place
    where it splits (the carina) into a right and left primary bronchus. \n\nThese
    supply air to the right and left lungs, splitting progressively into the secondary
    and tertiary bronchi for the lobes of the lungs, and into smaller and smaller
    bronchioles until they become the respiratory bronchioles. \n\nThese in turn
    supply air through alveolar ducts into the alveoli, where the exchange of gases
    take place. \n\nOxygen breathed in, diffuses through the walls of the alveoli
    into the enveloping capillaries and into the circulation, and carbon dioxide
    diffuses from the blood into the lungs to be breathed out.\nEstimates of the
    total surface area of lungs vary from 50 to 75 square metres (540 to 810 sq ft);
    although this is often quoted in textbooks and the media being \"the size of
    a tennis court\", it is actually less than half the size of a singles court.The
    bronchi in the conducting zone are reinforced with hyaline cartilage in order
    to hold open the airways. \n\nThe bronchioles have no cartilage and are surrounded
    instead by smooth muscle. \n\nAir is warmed to 37 \xB0C (99 \xB0F), humidified
    and cleansed by the conducting zone. \n\nParticles from the air being removed
    by the cilia on the respiratory epithelium lining the passageways, in a process
    called mucociliary clearance.\nPulmonary stretch receptors in the smooth muscle
    of the airways initiate a reflex known as the Hering\u2013Breuer reflex that
    prevents the lungs from over-inflation, during forceful inspiration.\n\n\n===
    Blood supply ===\n\n\nThe lungs have a dual blood supply provided by a bronchial
    and a pulmonary circulation. \n\nThe bronchial circulation supplies oxygenated
    blood to the airways of the lungs, through the bronchial arteries that leave
    the aorta. \n\nThere are usually three arteries, two to the left lung and one
    to the right, and they branch alongside the bronchi and bronchioles. \n\nThe
    pulmonary circulation carries deoxygenated blood from the heart to the lungs
    and returns the oxygenated blood to the heart to supply the rest of the body.The
    blood volume of the lungs is about 450 millilitres on average, about 9% of the
    total blood volume of the entire circulatory system. \n\nThis quantity can easily
    fluctuate from between one-half and twice the normal volume. \n\nAlso, in the
    event of blood loss through hemorrhage, blood from the lungs can partially compensate
    by automatically transferring to the systemic circulation.\n\n\n=== Nerve supply
    ===\n\nThe lungs are supplied by nerves of the autonomic nervous system. \n\nInput
    from the parasympathetic nervous system occurs via the vagus nerve. \n\nWhen
    stimulated by acetylcholine, this causes constriction of the smooth muscle lining
    the bronchus and bronchioles, and increases the secretions from glands. \n\nThe
    lungs also have a sympathetic tone from norepinephrine acting on the beta 2 adrenoceptors
    in the respiratory tract, which causes bronchodilation.The action of breathing
    takes place because of nerve signals sent by the respiratory center in the brainstem,
    along the phrenic nerve from the cervical plexus to the diaphragm.\n\n\n=== Variation
    ===\n\nThe lobes of the lung are subject to anatomical variations. \n\nA horizontal
    interlobar fissure was found to be incomplete in 25% of right lungs, or even
    absent in 11% of all cases. \n\nAn accessory fissure was also found in 14% and
    22% of left and right lungs, respectively. \n\nAn oblique fissure was found to
    be incomplete in 21% to 47% of left lungs. \n\nIn some cases a fissure is absent,
    or extra, resulting in a right lung with only two lobes, or a left lung with
    three lobes.A variation in the airway branching structure has been found specifically
    in the central airway\nbranching. \n\nThis variation is associated with the development
    of COPD in adulthood.\n\n\n== Development ==\n\n\nThe development of the human
    lungs arise from the laryngotracheal groove and develop to maturity over several
    weeks in the foetus and for several years following birth.The larynx, trachea,
    bronchi and lungs that make up the respiratory tract, begin to form during the
    fourth week of embryogenesis from the lung bud which appears ventrally to the
    caudal portion of the foregut.\n\nThe respiratory tract has a branching structure,
    and is also known as the respiratory tree. \n\nIn the embryo this structure is
    developed in the process of branching morphogenesis, and is generated by the
    repeated splitting of the tip of the branch. \n\nIn the development of the lungs
    (as in some other organs) the epithelium forms branching tubes. \n\nThe lung
    has a left-right symmetry and each bud known as a bronchial bud grows out as
    a tubular epithelium that becomes a bronchus. \n\nEach bronchus branches into
    bronchioles. \n\nThe branching is a result of the tip of each tube bifurcating.
    \n\nThe branching process forms the bronchi, bronchioles, and ultimately the
    alveoli. \n\nThe four genes mostly associated with branching morphogenesis in
    the lung are the intercellular signalling protein \u2013 sonic hedgehog (SHH),
    fibroblast growth factors FGF10 and FGFR2b, and bone morphogenetic protein BMP4.
    \n\nFGF10 is seen to have the most prominent role. \n\nFGF10 is a paracrine signalling
    molecule needed for epithelial branching, and SHH inhibits FGF10. \n\nThe development
    of the alveoli is influenced by a different mechanism whereby continued bifurcation
    is stopped and the distal tips become dilated to form the alveoli.\nAt the end
    of the fourth week the lung bud divides into two, the right and left primary
    bronchial buds on each side of the trachea. \n\nDuring the fifth week the right
    bud branches into three secondary bronchial buds and the left branches into two
    secondary bronchial buds. \n\nThese give rise to the lobes of the lungs, three
    on the right and two on the left. \n\nOver the following week, the secondary
    buds branch into tertiary buds, about ten on each side. \n\nFrom the sixth week
    to the sixteenth week, the major elements of the lungs appear except the alveoli.
    \n\nFrom week 16 to week 26, the bronchi enlarge and lung tissue becomes highly
    vascularised. \n\nBronchioles and alveolar ducts also develop. \n\nBy week 26
    the terminal bronchioles have formed which branch into two respiratory bronchioles.
    \n\nDuring the period covering the 26th week until birth the important blood\u2013air
    barrier is established. \n\nSpecialised type I alveolar cells where gas exchange
    will take place, together with the type II alveolar cells that secrete pulmonary
    surfactant, appear. \n\nThe surfactant reduces the surface tension at the air-alveolar
    surface which allows expansion of the alveolar sacs. \n\nThe alveolar sacs contain
    the primitive alveoli that form at the end of the alveolar ducts,\nand their
    appearance around the seventh month marks the point at which limited respiration
    would be possible, and the premature baby could survive.\n\n\n=== Vitamin A deficiency
    ===\n\n\nThe developing lung is particularly vulnerable to changes in the levels
    of vitamin A. \n\nVitamin A deficiency has been linked to changes in the epithelial
    lining of the lung and in the lung parenchyma. \n\nThis can disrupt the normal
    physiology of the lung and predispose to respiratory diseases. \n\nSevere nutritional
    deficiency in vitamin A results in a reduction in the formation of the alveolar
    walls (septa) and to notable changes in the respiratory epithelium; alterations
    are noted in the extracellular matrix and in the protein content of the basement
    membrane. \n\nThe extracellular matrix maintains lung elasticity; the basement
    membrane is associated with alveolar epithelium and is important in the blood-air
    barrier. \n\nThe deficiency is associated with functional defects and disease
    states. \n\nVitamin A is crucial in the development of the alveoli which continues
    for several years after birth.\n\n\n=== After birth ===\n\nAt birth, the baby's
    lungs are filled with fluid secreted by the lungs and are not inflated. \n\nAfter
    birth the infant's central nervous system reacts to the sudden change in temperature
    and environment. \n\nThis triggers the first breath, within about 10 seconds
    after delivery. \n\nBefore birth, the lungs are filled with fetal lung fluid.  
    After the first breath, the fluid is quickly absorbed into the body or exhaled.
    \n\nThe resistance in the lung's blood vessels decreases giving an increased
    surface area for gas exchange, and the lungs begin to breathe spontaneously.
    \n\nThis accompanies other changes which result in an increased amount of blood
    entering the lung tissues.At birth the lungs are very undeveloped with only around
    one sixth of the alveoli of the adult lung present. \n\nThe alveoli continue
    to form into early adulthood, and their ability to form when necessary is seen
    in the regeneration of the lung. \n\nAlveolar septa have a double capillary network
    instead of the single network of the developed lung. \n\nOnly after the maturation
    of the capillary network can the lung enter a normal phase of growth. \n\nFollowing
    the early growth in numbers of alveoli there is another stage of the alveoli
    being enlarged.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\n\n\n=== Gas exchange ===\n\nThe major
    function of the lungs is gas exchange between the lungs and the blood. \n\nThe
    alveolar and pulmonary capillary gases equilibrate across the thin blood\u2013air
    barrier. \n\nThis thin membrane (about 0.5 \u20132 \u03BCm thick) is folded into
    about 300 million alveoli, providing an extremely large surface area (estimates
    varying between 70 and 145 m2) for gas exchange to occur.\n\nThe lungs are not
    capable of expanding to breathe on their own, and will only do so when there
    is an increase in the volume of the thoracic cavity. \n\nThis is achieved by
    the muscles of respiration, through the contraction of the diaphragm, and the
    intercostal muscles which pull the rib cage upwards as shown in the diagram.
    \n\nDuring breathing out the muscles relax, returning the lungs to their resting
    position. \n\nAt this point the lungs contain the functional residual capacity
    (FRC) of air, which, in the adult human, has a volume of about 2.5\u20133.0 litres.During
    heavy breathing as in exertion, a large number of accessory muscles in the neck
    and abdomen are recruited, that during exhalation pull the ribcage down, decreasing
    the volume of the thoracic cavity. \n\nThe FRC is now decreased, but since the
    lungs cannot be emptied completely there is still about a litre of residual air
    left. \n\nLung function testing is carried out to evaluate lung volumes and capacities.\n\n\n===
    Protection ===\n\nThe lungs possess several characteristics which protect against
    infection. \n\nThe respiratory tract is lined by respiratory epithelium or respiratory
    mucosa, with hair-like projections called cilia that beat rhythmically and carry
    mucus. \n\nThis mucociliary clearance is an important defence system against
    air-borne infection. \n\nThe dust particles and bacteria in the inhaled air are
    caught in the mucosal surface of the airways, and are moved up towards the pharynx
    by the rhythmic upward beating action of the cilia.:\u200A661\u2013730\u200A
    The lining of the lung also secretes immunoglobulin A which protects against
    respiratory infections; goblet cells secrete mucus which also contains several
    antimicrobial compounds such as defensins, antiproteases, and antioxidants. \n\nA
    rare type of specialised cell called a pulmonary ionocyte that is suggested may
    regulate mucus viscosity has been described. \n\nIn addition, the lining of the
    lung also contains macrophages, immune cells which engulf and destroy debris
    and microbes that enter the lung in a process known as phagocytosis; and dendritic
    cells which present antigens to activate components of the adaptive immune system
    such as T cells and B cells.The size of the respiratory tract and the flow of
    air also protect the lungs from larger particles. \n\nSmaller particles deposit
    in the mouth and behind the mouth in the oropharynx, and larger particles are
    trapped in nasal hair after inhalation.\n\n\n=== Other ===\n\nIn addition to
    their function in respiration, the lungs have a number of other functions. \n\nThey
    are involved in maintaining homeostasis, helping in the regulation of blood pressure
    as part of the renin\u2013angiotensin system. \n\nThe inner lining of the blood
    vessels secretes angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) an enzyme that catalyses
    the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. \n\nThe lungs are involved
    in the blood's acid\u2013base homeostasis by expelling carbon dioxide when breathing.The
    lungs also serve a protective role. \n\nSeveral blood-borne substances, such
    as a few types of prostaglandins, leukotrienes, serotonin and bradykinin, are
    excreted through the lungs. \n\nDrugs and other substances can be absorbed, modified
    or excreted in the lungs. \n\nThe lungs filter out small blood clots from veins
    and prevent them from entering arteries and causing strokes.The lungs also play
    a pivotal role in speech by providing air and airflow for the creation of vocal
    sounds, and other paralanguage communications such as sighs and gasps.\nResearch
    suggests a role of the lungs in the production of blood platelets.\n\n\n== Gene
    and protein expression ==\n\n\nAbout 20,000 protein coding genes are expressed
    in human cells and almost 75% of these genes are expressed in the normal lung.
    \n\nA little less than 200 of these genes are more specifically expressed in
    the lung with less than 20 genes being highly lung specific. \n\nThe highest
    expression of lung specific proteins are different surfactant proteins, such
    as SFTPA1, SFTPB and SFTPC, and napsin, expressed in type II pneumocytes. \n\nOther
    proteins with elevated expression in the lung are the dynein protein DNAH5 in
    ciliated cells, and the secreted SCGB1A1 protein in mucus-secreting goblet cells
    of the airway mucosa.\n\n\n== Clinical significance ==\n\n\nLungs can be affected
    by a number of diseases and disorders. \n\nPulmonology is the medical speciality
    that deals with respiratory diseases involving the lungs and respiratory system.
    \n\nCardiothoracic surgery deals with surgery of the lungs including lung volume
    reduction surgery, lobectomy, pneumectomy and lung transplantation.\n\n\n===
    Inflammation and infection ===\n\nInflammatory conditions of the lung tissue
    are pneumonia, of the respiratory tract are bronchitis and bronchiolitis, and
    of the pleurae surrounding the lungs pleurisy. \n\nInflammation is usually caused
    by infections due to bacteria or viruses. \n\nWhen the lung tissue is inflamed
    due to other causes it is called pneumonitis. \n\nOne major cause of bacterial
    pneumonia is tuberculosis. \n\nChronic infections often occur in those with immunodeficiency
    and can include a fungal infection by Aspergillus fumigatus that can lead to
    an aspergilloma forming in the lung.Alcohol affects the lungs and can cause inflammatory
    alcoholic lung disease. \n\nAcute exposure to alcohol stimulates the beating
    of cilia in the respiratory epithelium. \n\nHowever, chronic exposure has the
    effect of desensitising the ciliary response which reduces mucociliary clearance
    (MCC). \n\nMCC is an innate defense system protecting against pollutants and
    pathogens, and when this is disrupted the numbers of alveolar macrophages are
    decreased. \n\nA subsequent inflammatory response is the release of cytokines.
    \n\nAnother consequence is the susceptibility to infection.\n\n\n=== Blood-supply
    changes ===\n\n\nA pulmonary embolism is a blood clot that becomes lodged in
    the pulmonary arteries. \n\nThe majority of emboli arise because of deep vein
    thrombosis in the legs. \n\nPulmonary emboli may be investigated using a ventilation/perfusion
    scan, a CT scan of the arteries of the lung, or blood tests such as the D-dimer.
    \n\nPulmonary hypertension describes an increased pressure at the beginning of
    the pulmonary artery that has a large number of differing causes. \n\nOther rarer
    conditions may also affect the blood supply of the lung, such as granulomatosis
    with polyangiitis, which causes inflammation of the small blood vessels of the
    lungs and kidneys.A lung contusion is a bruise caused by chest trauma. \n\nIt
    results in hemorrhage of the alveoli causing a build-up of fluid which can impair
    breathing, and this can be either mild or severe.\nThe function of the lungs
    can also be affected by compression from fluid in the pleural cavity pleural
    effusion, or other substances such as air (pneumothorax), blood (hemothorax),
    or rarer causes. \n\nThese may be investigated using a chest X-ray or CT scan,
    and may require the insertion of a surgical drain until the underlying cause
    is identified and treated.\n\n\n=== Obstructive lung diseases ===\n\n\nAsthma,
    chronic bronchitis, bronchiectasis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
    (COPD) are all obstructive lung diseases characterised by airway obstruction.
    \n\nThis limits the amount of air that is able to enter alveoli because of constriction
    of the bronchial tree, due to inflammation. \n\nObstructive lung diseases are
    often identified because of symptoms and diagnosed with pulmonary function tests
    such as spirometry. \n\nMany obstructive lung diseases are managed by avoiding
    triggers (such as dust mites or smoking), with symptom control such as bronchodilators,
    and with suppression of inflammation (such as through corticosteroids) in severe
    cases. \n\nA common cause of chronic bronchitis, and emphysema, is smoking; and
    common causes of bronchiectasis include severe infections and cystic fibrosis.
    \n\nThe definitive cause of asthma is not yet known.The breakdown of alveolar
    tissue, often as a result of tobacco-smoking leads to emphysema, which can become
    severe enough to develop into COPD. \n\nElastase breaks down the elastin in the
    lung's connective tissue that can also result in emphysema. \n\nElastase is inhibited
    by the acute-phase protein, alpha-1 antitrypsin, and when there is a deficiency
    in this, emphysema can develop. \n\nWith persistent stress from smoking, the
    airway basal cells become disarranged and lose their regenerative ability needed
    to repair the epithelial barrier. \n\nThe disorganised basal cells are seen to
    be responsible for the major airway changes that are characteristic of COPD,
    and with continued stress can undergo a malignant transformation. \n\nStudies
    have shown that the initial development of emphysema is centred on the early
    changes in the airway epithelium of the small airways. \n\nBasal cells become
    further deranged in a smoker's transition to clinically defined COPD.\n\n\n===
    Restrictive lung diseases ===\n\nSome types of chronic lung diseases are classified
    as restrictive lung disease, because of a restriction in the amount of lung tissue
    involved in respiration. \n\nThese include pulmonary fibrosis which can occur
    when the lung is inflamed for a long period of time. \n\nFibrosis in the lung
    replaces functioning lung tissue with fibrous connective tissue. \n\nThis can
    be due to a large variety of occupational lung diseases such as Coalworker's
    pneumoconiosis, autoimmune diseases or more rarely to a reaction to medication.
    \n\nSevere respiratory disorders, where spontaneous breathing is not enough to
    maintain life, may need the use of mechanical ventilation to ensure an adequate
    supply of air.\n\n\n=== Cancers ===\n\nLung cancer can either arise directly
    from lung tissue or as a result of metastasis from another part of the body.
    \n\nThere are two main types of primary tumour described as either small-cell
    or non-small-cell lung carcinomas. \n\nThe major risk factor for cancer is smoking.
    \n\nOnce a cancer is identified it is staged using scans such as a CT scan and
    a sample of tissue from a biopsy is taken. \n\nCancers may be treated surgically
    by removing the tumour, the use of radiotherapy, chemotherapy or a combination,
    or with the aim of symptom control. \n\nLung cancer screening is being recommended
    in the United States for high-risk populations.\n\n\n=== Congenital disorders
    ===\n\nCongenital disorders include cystic fibrosis, pulmonary hypoplasia (an
    incomplete development of the lungs)congenital diaphragmatic hernia, and infant
    respiratory distress syndrome caused by a deficiency in lung surfactant. \n\nAn
    azygos lobe is a congenital anatomical variation which though usually without
    effect can cause problems in thoracoscopic procedures.\n\n\n=== Others ===\n\nA
    pneumothorax (collapsed lung) is an abnormal collection of air in the pleural
    space that causes an uncoupling of the lung from the chest wall. \n\nThe lung
    cannot expand against the air pressure inside the pleural space. \n\nAn easy
    to understand example is a traumatic pneumothorax, where air enters the pleural
    space from outside the body, as occurs with puncture to the chest wall. \n\nSimilarly,
    scuba divers ascending while holding their breath with their lungs fully inflated
    can cause air sacs (alveoli) to burst and leak high pressure air into the pleural
    space.\n\n\n=== Lung examination ===\n\n\nAs part of a physical examination in
    response to respiratory symptoms of shortness of breath, and cough, a lung examination
    may be carried out. \n\nThis exam includes palpation and auscultation. \n\nThe
    areas of the lungs that can be listened to using a stethoscope are called the
    lung fields, and these are the posterior, lateral, and anterior lung fields.
    \n\nThe posterior fields can be listened to from the back and include: the lower
    lobes (taking up three quarters of the posterior fields); the anterior fields
    taking up the other quarter; and the lateral fields under the axillae, the left
    axilla for the lingual, the right axilla for the middle right lobe. \n\nThe anterior
    fields can also be auscultated from the front. \n\nAbnormal breathing sounds
    heard during a lung exam can indicate the presence of a lung condition; wheezing
    for example is commonly associated with asthma and COPD.\n\n\n=== Lung function
    testing ===\n\n\nLung function testing is carried out by evaluating a person's
    capacity to inhale and exhale in different circumstances. \n\nThe volume of air
    inhaled and exhaled by a person at rest is the tidal volume (normally 500-750mL);
    the inspiratory reserve volume and expiratory reserve volume are the additional
    amounts a person is able to forcibly inhale and exhale respectively. \n\nThe
    summed total of forced inspiration and expiration is a person's vital capacity.
    \n\nNot all air is expelled from the lungs even after a forced breath out; the
    remainder of the air is called the residual volume. \n\nTogether these terms
    are referred to as lung volumes.Pulmonary plethysmographs are used to measure
    functional residual capacity. \n\nFunctional residual capacity cannot be measured
    by tests that rely on breathing out, as a person is only able to breathe a maximum
    of 80% of their total functional capacity. \n\nThe total lung capacity depends
    on the person's age, height, weight, and sex, and normally ranges between 4 and
    6 litres. \n\nFemales tend to have a 20\u201325% lower capacity than males. \n\nTall
    people tend to have a larger total lung capacity than shorter people. \n\nSmokers
    have a lower capacity than nonsmokers. \n\nThinner persons tend to have a larger
    capacity. \n\nLung capacity can be increased by physical training as much as
    40% but the effect may be modified by exposure to air pollution.Other lung function
    tests include spirometry, measuring the amount (volume) and flow of air that
    can be inhaled and exhaled. \n\nThe maximum volume of breath that can be exhaled
    is called the vital capacity. \n\nIn particular, how much a person is able to
    exhale in one second (called forced expiratory volume (FEV1)) as a proportion
    of how much they are able to exhale in total (FEV). \n\nThis ratio, the FEV1/FEV
    ratio, is important to distinguish whether a lung disease is restrictive or obstructive.
    \n\nAnother test is that of the lung's diffusing capacity \u2013 this is a measure
    of the transfer of gas from air to the blood in the lung capillaries.\n\n\n==
    Other animals ==\n\n\n\n=== Birds ===\n\n\n \nThe lungs of birds are relatively
    small, but are connected to 8 or 9 air sacs that extend through much of the body,
    and are in turn connected to air spaces within the bones. \n\nOn inhalation,
    air travels through the trachea of a bird into the air sacs. \n\nAir then travels
    continuously from the air sacs at the back, through the lungs, which are relatively
    fixed in size, to the air sacs at the front. \n\nFrom here, the air is exhaled.
    \n\nThese fixed size lungs are called \"circulatory lungs\", as distinct from
    the \"bellows-type lungs\" found in most other animals.The lungs of birds contain
    millions of tiny parallel passages called parabronchi. \n\nSmall sacs called
    atria radiate from the walls of the tiny passages; these, like the alveoli in
    other lungs, are the site of gas exchange by simple diffusion. \n\nThe blood
    flow around the parabronchi and their atria forms a cross-current process of
    gas exchange (see diagram on the right).The air sacs, which hold air, do not
    contribute much to gas exchange, despite being thin-walled, as they are poorly
    vascularised. \n\nThe air sacs expand and contract due to changes in the volume
    in the thorax and abdomen. \n\nThis volume change is caused by the movement of
    the sternum and ribs and this movement is often synchronised with movement of
    the flight muscles.Parabronchi in which the air flow is unidirectional are called
    paleopulmonic parabronchi and are found in all birds. \n\nSome birds, however,
    have, in addition, a lung structure where the air flow in the parabronchi is
    bidirectional. \n\nThese are termed neopulmonic parabronchi.\n\n\n=== Reptiles
    ===\n\n\nThe lungs of most reptiles have a single bronchus running down the centre,
    from which numerous branches reach out to individual pockets throughout the lungs.
    \n\nThese pockets are similar to alveoli in mammals, but much larger and fewer
    in number. \n\nThese give the lung a sponge-like texture. \n\nIn tuataras, snakes,
    and some lizards, the lungs are simpler in structure, similar to that of typical
    amphibians.Snakes and limbless lizards typically possess only the right lung
    as a major respiratory organ; the left lung is greatly reduced, or even absent.
    \n\nAmphisbaenians, however, have the opposite arrangement, with a major left
    lung, and a reduced or absent right lung.Both crocodilians and monitor lizards
    have developed lungs similar to those of birds, providing a unidirectional airflow
    and even possessing air sacs. \n\nThe now extinct pterosaurs have seemingly even
    further refined this type of lung, extending the airsacs into the wing membranes
    and, in the case of lonchodectids, tupuxuara, and azhdarchoids, the hindlimbs.Reptilian
    lungs typically receive air via expansion and contraction of the ribs driven
    by axial muscles and buccal pumping. \n\nCrocodilians also rely on the hepatic
    piston method, in which the liver is pulled back by a muscle anchored to the
    pubic bone (part of the pelvis) called the diaphragmaticus, which in turn creates
    negative pressure in the crocodile's thoracic cavity, allowing air to be moved
    into the lungs by Boyle's law. \n\nTurtles, which are unable to move their ribs,
    instead use their forelimbs and pectoral girdle to force air in and out of the
    lungs.\n\n\n=== Amphibians ===\n\n\nThe lungs of most frogs and other amphibians
    are simple and balloon-like, with gas exchange limited to the outer surface of
    the lung. \n\nThis is not very efficient, but amphibians have low metabolic demands
    and can also quickly dispose of carbon dioxide by diffusion across their skin
    in water, and supplement their oxygen supply by the same method. \n\nAmphibians
    employ a positive pressure system to get air to their lungs, forcing air down
    into the lungs by buccal pumping. \n\nThis is distinct from most higher vertebrates,
    who use a breathing system driven by negative pressure where the lungs are inflated
    by expanding the rib cage. \n\nIn buccal pumping, the floor of the mouth is lowered,
    filling the mouth cavity with air. \n\nThe throat muscles then presses the throat
    against the underside of the skull, forcing the air into the lungs.Due to the
    possibility of respiration across the skin combined with small size, all known
    lungless tetrapods are amphibians. \n\nThe majority of salamander species are
    lungless salamanders, which respirate through their skin and tissues lining their
    mouth. \n\nThis necessarily restricts their size: all are small and rather thread-like
    in appearance, maximising skin surface relative to body volume. \n\nOther known
    lungless tetrapods are the Bornean flat-headed frog and Atretochoana eiselti,
    a caecilian.The lungs of amphibians typically have a few narrow internal walls
    (septa) of soft tissue around the outer walls, increasing the respiratory surface
    area and giving the lung a honeycomb appearance. \n\nIn some salamanders even
    these are lacking, and the lung has a smooth wall. \n\nIn caecilians, as in snakes,
    only the right lung attains any size or development.\n\n\n=== Lungfish ===\n\nThe
    lungs of lungfish are similar to those of amphibians, with few, if any, internal
    septa. \n\nIn the Australian lungfish, there is only a single lung, albeit divided
    into two lobes. \n\nOther lungfish and Polypterus, however, have two lungs, which
    are located in the upper part of the body, with the connecting duct curving around
    and above the esophagus. \n\nThe blood supply also twists around the esophagus,
    suggesting that the lungs originally evolved in the ventral part of the body,
    as in other vertebrates.\n\n\n=== Invertebrates ===\n\n\nSome invertebrates have
    lung-like structures that serve a similar respiratory purpose as, but are not
    evolutionarily related to, vertebrate lungs. \n\nSome arachnids, such as spiders
    and scorpions, have structures called book lungs used for atmospheric gas exchange.
    \n\nSome species of spider have four pairs of book lungs but most have two pairs.
    \n\nScorpions have spiracles on their body for the entrance of air to the book
    lungs.The coconut crab is terrestrial and uses structures called branchiostegal
    lungs to breathe air. \n\nThey cannot swim and would drown in water, yet they
    possess a rudimentary set of gills. \n\nThey can breathe on land and hold their
    breath underwater. \n\nThe branchiostegal lungs are seen as a developmental adaptive
    stage from water-living to enable land-living, or from fish to amphibian.Pulmonates
    are mostly land snails and slugs that have developed a simple lung from the mantle
    cavity. \n\nAn externally located opening called the pneumostome allows air to
    be taken into the mantle cavity lung.\n\n\n== Evolutionary origins ==\n\nThe
    lungs of today's terrestrial vertebrates and the gas bladders of today's fish
    are believed to have evolved from simple sacs, as outpocketings of the esophagus,
    that allowed early fish to gulp air under oxygen-poor conditions. \n\nThese outpocketings
    first arose in the bony fish. \n\nIn most of the ray-finned fish the sacs evolved
    into closed off gas bladders, while a number of carp, trout, herring, catfish,
    and eels have retained the physostome condition with the sac being open to the
    esophagus. \n\nIn more basal bony fish, such as the gar, bichir, bowfin and the
    lobe-finned fish, the bladders have evolved to primarily function as lungs. \n\nThe
    lobe-finned fish gave rise to the land-based tetrapods. \n\nThus, the lungs of
    vertebrates are homologous to the gas bladders of fish (but not to their gills).\n\n\n==

  descriptionText: "\n\nVERMIFORM APPENDIX/\nAPPENDIX\n\n\nThe appendix (or vermiform
    appendix; also cecal [or caecal] appendix; vermix; or vermiform process) is a
    finger-like, blind-ended tube connected to the cecum, from which it develops
    in the embryo. \n\nThe cecum is a pouch-like structure of the large intestine,
    located at the junction of the small and the large intestines. \n\nThe term \"vermiform\"
    comes from Latin and means \"worm-shaped.\" The appendix used to be considered
    a vestigial organ, but this view has changed over the past decades. \n\nResearch
    suggests that the appendix may serve an important purpose. \n\nIn particular,
    it may serve as a reservoir for beneficial gut bacteria.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe
    human appendix averages 9 cm (3.5 in) in length but can range from 5 to 35 cm
    (2.0 to 13.8 in). \n\nThe diameter of the appendix is 6 mm (0.24 in), and more
    than 6 mm (0.24 in) is considered a thickened or inflamed appendix. \n\nThe longest
    appendix ever removed was 26 cm (10 in) long. \n\nThe appendix is usually located
    in the lower right quadrant of the abdomen, near the right hip bone. \n\nThe
    base of the appendix is located 2 cm (0.79 in) beneath the ileocecal valve that
    separates the large intestine from the small intestine. \n\nIts position within
    the abdomen corresponds to a point on the surface known as McBurney's point.\n\nThe
    appendix is connected to the mesentery in the lower region of the ileum, by a
    short region of the mesocolon known as the mesoappendix.\n\n\n=== Variation ===\n\nSome
    identical twins\u2014known as mirror image twins\u2014can have a mirror-imaged
    anatomy, a congenital condition with the appendix located in the lower left quadrant
    of the abdomen instead of the lower right. \n\nIntestinal malrotation may also
    cause displacement of the appendix to the left side.\n\nWhile the base of the
    appendix is typically located 2 cm (0.79 in) below the ileocecal valve, the tip
    of the appendix can be variably located\u2014in the pelvis, outside the peritoneum
    or behind the cecum. \n\nThe prevalence of the different positions varies amongst
    populations with the retrocecal position being most common in Ghana and Sudan,
    with 67.3% and 58.3% occurrence respectively, in comparison to Iran and Bosnia
    where the pelvic position is most common, with 55.8% and 57.7% occurrence respectively.\n\nIn
    very rare cases, the appendix may not be present at all (laparotomies for suspected
    appendicitis have given a frequency of 1 in 100,000).Sometimes there is a semi-circular
    fold of mucous membrane at the opening of the appendix. \n\nThis valve of the
    vermiform appendix is also called Gerlach's valve.\n\n\n== Functions ==\n\n===
    Maintaining gut flora ===\n\nAlthough it has been long accepted that the immune
    tissue surrounding the appendix and elsewhere in the gut\u2014called gut-associated
    lymphoid tissue\u2014carries out a number of important functions, explanations
    were lacking for the distinctive shape of the appendix and its apparent lack
    of specific importance and function as judged by an absence of side effects following
    its removal. \n\nTherefore, the notion that the appendix is only vestigial became
    widely held.\nWilliam Parker, Randy Bollinger, and colleagues at Duke University
    proposed in 2007 that the appendix serves as a haven for useful bacteria when
    illness flushes the bacteria from the rest of the intestines. \n\nThis proposition
    is based on an understanding that emerged by the early 2000s of how the immune
    system supports the growth of beneficial intestinal bacteria, in combination
    with many well-known features of the appendix, including its architecture, its
    location just below the normal one-way flow of food and germs in the large intestine,
    and its association with copious amounts of immune tissue. \n\nResearch performed
    at Winthrop\u2013University Hospital showed that individuals without an appendix
    were four times as likely to have a recurrence of Clostridium difficile colitis.
    \n\nThe appendix, therefore, may act as a \"safe house\" for beneficial bacteria.
    \n\nThis reservoir of bacteria could then serve to repopulate the gut flora in
    the digestive system following a bout of dysentery or cholera or to boost it
    following a milder gastrointestinal illness.\n\n\n=== Immune and lymphatic systems
    ===\n\nThe appendix has been identified as an important component of mammalian
    mucosal immune function, particularly B cell-mediated immune responses and extrathymically
    derived T cells. \n\nThis structure helps in the proper movement and removal
    of waste matter in the digestive system, contains lymphatic vessels that regulate
    pathogens, and lastly, might even produce early defences that prevent deadly
    diseases. \n\nAdditionally, it is thought that this may provide more immune defences
    from invading pathogens and getting the lymphatic system's B and T cells to fight
    the viruses and bacteria that infect that portion of the bowel and training them
    so that immune responses are targeted and more able to reliably and less dangerously
    fight off pathogens. \n\nIn addition, there are different immune cells called
    innate lymphoid cells that function in the gut in order to help the appendix
    maintain digestive health. \n\nResearch also shows a positive correlation between
    the existence of appendix and the concentration of cecal lymphoid tissue, which
    supports that not only does the appendix evolve as a complex with the cecum but
    also has major immune benefits. \n\n\n== Clinical significance ==\n\nCommon diseases
    of the appendix (in humans) are appendicitis and carcinoid tumors (appendiceal
    carcinoid). \n\nAppendix cancer accounts for about 1 in 200 of all gastrointestinal
    malignancies. \n\nIn rare cases, adenomas are also present.\n\n\n=== Appendicitis
    ===\n\n\nAppendicitis is a condition characterized by inflammation of the appendix.
    \n\nPain often begins in the center of the abdomen, corresponding to the appendix's
    development as part of the embryonic midgut. \n\nThis pain is typically a dull,
    poorly localized, visceral pain.As the inflammation progresses, the pain begins
    to localize more clearly to the right lower quadrant, as the peritoneum becomes
    inflamed. \n\nThis peritoneal inflammation, or peritonitis, results in rebound
    tenderness (pain upon removal of pressure rather than application of pressure).
    \n\nIn particular, it presents at McBurney's point, 1/3 of the way along a line
    drawn from the anterior superior iliac spine to the umbilicus. \n\nTypically,
    point (skin) pain is not present until the parietal peritoneum is inflamed, as
    well. \n\nFever and an immune system response are also characteristic of appendicitis.
    \n\nOther signs and symptoms may include nausea and vomiting, low-grade fever
    that may get worse, constipation or diarrhea, abdominal bloating, or flatulence.Appendicitis
    usually requires the removal of the inflamed appendix, in an appendectomy either
    by laparotomy or laparoscopy. \n\nUntreated, the appendix may rupture, leading
    to peritonitis, followed by shock, and, if still untreated, death.Recently, practitioners
    reported good results in treating appendicitis without appendectomy. \n\nManaging
    appendicitis using only antibiotic treatment and cooling of the appendix was
    successful in first occurrence acute appendicitis without complication.\n\n\n===
    Surgery ===\n\n\nThe surgical removal of the appendix is called an appendectomy.
    \n\nThis removal is normally performed as an emergency procedure when the patient
    is suffering from acute appendicitis. \n\nIn the absence of surgical facilities,
    intravenous antibiotics are used to delay or avoid the onset of sepsis. \n\nIn
    some cases, the appendicitis resolves completely; more often, an inflammatory
    mass forms around the appendix. \n\nThis is a relative contraindication to surgery.\nThe
    appendix is also used for the construction of an efferent urinary conduit, in
    an operation known as the Mitrofanoff procedure, in people with a neurogenic
    bladder.\n\nThe appendix is also used as a means to access the colon in children
    with paralysed bowels or major rectal sphincter problems. \n\nThe appendix is
    brought out to the skin surface and the child/parent can then attach a catheter
    and easily wash out the colon (via normal defaecation) using an appropriate solution.\n\n\n==
    History ==\n\nCharles Darwin suggested that the appendix was mainly used by earlier
    hominids for digesting fibrous vegetation, then evolved to take on a new purpose
    over time. \n\nThe very long cecum of some herbivorous animals, such as in the
    horse or the koala, appears to support this hypothesis. \n\nThe koala's cecum
    enables it to host bacteria that specifically help to break down cellulose. \n\nHuman
    ancestors may have also relied upon this system when they lived on a diet rich
    in foliage. \n\nAs people began to eat more easily digested foods, they may have
    become less reliant on cellulose-rich plants for energy. \n\nAs the cecum became
    less necessary for digestion, mutations that were previously deleterious (and
    would have hindered evolutionary progress) were no longer important, so the mutations
    survived. \n\nIt is suggested that these alleles became more frequent and the
    cecum continued to shrink. \n\nAfter millions of years, the once-necessary cecum
    degraded to be the appendix of modern humans.Dr. \n\nHeather F. \n\nSmith of
    Midwestern University and colleagues explained:\n\nRecently ... improved understanding
    of gut immunity has merged with current thinking in biological and medical science,
    pointing to an apparent function of the mammalian cecal appendix as a safe-house
    for symbiotic gut microbes, preserving the flora during times of gastrointestinal
    infection in societies without modern medicine. \n\nThis function is potentially
    a selective force for the evolution and maintenance of the appendix.\n\nThree
    morphotypes of cecal-appendices can be described among mammals based primarily
    on the shape of the cecum: a distinct appendix branching from a rounded or sac-like
    cecum (as in many primate species), an appendix located at the apex of a long
    and voluminous cecum (as in the rabbit, greater glider and Cape dune mole rat),
    and an appendix in the absence of a pronounced cecum (as in the wombat). \n\nIn
    addition, long narrow appendix-like structures are found in mammals that either
    lack an apparent cecum (as in monotremes) or lack a distinct junction between
    the cecum and appendix-like structure (as in the koala). \n\nA cecal appendix
    has evolved independently at least twice, and apparently represents yet another
    example of convergence in morphology between Australian marsupials and placentals
    in the rest of the world. \n\nAlthough the appendix has apparently been lost
    by numerous species, it has also been maintained for more than 80 million years
    in at least one clade.\n\nIn a 2013 paper, the appendix was found to have evolved
    at least 32 times (and perhaps as many as 38 times) and to have been lost no
    more than six times. \n\nA more recent study using similar methods on an updated
    database yielded similar, though less spectacular results, with at least 29 gains
    and at the most 12 losses (all of which were ambiguous), and this is still significantly
    asymmetrical. \n\nThis suggests that the cecal appendix has a selective advantage
    in many situations and argues strongly against its vestigial nature. \n\nThis
    complex evolutionary history of the appendix, along with a great heterogeneity
    in its evolutionary rate in various taxa, suggests that it is a recurrent trait.\n\nSuch
    a function may be useful in a culture lacking modern sanitation and healthcare
    practice, where diarrhea may be prevalent. \n\nCurrent epidemiological data on
    the cause of death in developed countries collected by the World Health Organization
    in 2001 show that acute diarrhea is now the fourth leading cause of disease-related
    death in developing countries (data summarized by The Bill and Melinda Gates
    Foundation). \n\nTwo of the other leading causes of death are expected to have
    exerted limited or no selection pressure.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appendix_(anatomy)"

  descriptionText: "\n\nADENOHYPOPHYSIS/ANTERIOR PITUITARY\n\n\nA major organ of
    the endocrine system, the anterior pituitary (also called the adenohypophysis
    or pars anterior) is the glandular, anterior lobe that together with the posterior
    lobe (posterior pituitary, or the neurohypophysis) makes up the pituitary gland
    (hypophysis). \n\nThe anterior pituitary regulates several physiological processes,
    including stress, growth, reproduction, and lactation. \n\nProper functioning
    of the anterior pituitary and of the organs it regulates can often be ascertained
    via blood tests that measure hormone levels.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\n\nThe pituitary
    gland sits in a protective bony enclosure called the sella turcica (Turkish chair/saddle).
    \n\nIt is composed of three lobes: the anterior, intermediate, and posterior
    lobes. \n\nIn many animals, these lobes are distinct. \n\nHowever, in humans,
    the intermediate lobe is but a few cell layers thick and indistinct; as a result,
    it is often considered part of the anterior pituitary. \n\nIn all animals, the
    fleshy, glandular anterior pituitary is distinct from the neural composition
    of the posterior pituitary.\n\nThe anterior pituitary is composed of three regions:\n\nPars
    distalisThe pars distalis (distal part) comprises the majority of the anterior
    pituitary and is where the bulk of pituitary hormone production occurs. \n\nThe
    pars distalis contains two types of cells, including chromophobe cells and chromophil
    cells. \n\nThe chromophils can be further divided into acidophils (alpha cells)
    and basophils (beta cells). \n\nThese cells all together produce hormones of
    the anterior pituitary and release them into the blood stream.\n\nNota bene:
    The terms \"basophil\" and \"acidophil\" are used by some books, whereas others
    prefer not to use these terms. \n\nThis is due to the possible confusion with
    white blood cells, where one may also find basophils and acidophils.\n\n\t\t\nPars
    tuberalis\nThe pars tuberalis (tubular part) forms a part of the sheath extending
    up from the pars distalis, which joins with the pituitary stalk (also known as
    the infundibular stalk or infundibulum), arising from the posterior lobe. \n\n(The
    pituitary stalk connects the hypothalamus to the posterior pituitary.) The function
    of the pars tuberalis is poorly understood. \n\nHowever, it has been seen to
    be important in receiving the endocrine signal in the form of TSHB (a \u03B2
    subunit of TSH), informing the pars tuberalis of the photoperiod (length of day).
    \n\nThe expression of this subunit is regulated by the secretion of melatonin
    in response to light information transmitted to the pineal gland. \n\nEarlier
    studies have shown localization of melatonin receptors in this region.\n\nPars
    intermedia\nThe pars intermedia (intermediate part) sits between the pars distalis
    and the posterior pituitary, forming the boundary between the anterior and posterior
    pituitaries. \n\nIt is very small and indistinct in humans.\n\n\n=== Development
    ===\n\nThe anterior pituitary is derived from the ectoderm, more specifically
    from that of Rathke\u2019s pouch, part of the developing hard palate in the embryo.Rathke\u2019s
    pouch is also ectodermal in origin.\n\nThe pouch eventually loses its connection
    with the pharynx, giving rise to the anterior pituitary. \n\nThe anterior wall
    of Rathke's pouch proliferates, filling most of the pouch to form the pars distalis
    and the pars tuberalis. \n\nThe posterior wall of the anterior pituitary forms
    the pars intermedia. \n\nIts formation from the soft tissues of the upper palate
    contrasts with the posterior pituitary, which originates from neuroectoderm.\n\n\n==
    Function ==\n\nThe anterior pituitary contains five types of endocrine cell,
    and they are defined by the hormones they secrete: somatotropes (GH); Lactotropes
    (PRL); gonadotropes (LH and FSH); corticotropes (ACTH) and thyrotropes (TSH).
    \n\nIt also contains non-endocrine folliculostellate cells which are thought
    to stimulate and support the endocrine cell populations.\n\nHormones secreted
    by the anterior pituitary are trophic hormones (Greek: trophe, \u201Cnourishment\u201D).
    \n\nTrophic hormones directly affect growth either as hyperplasia or hypertrophy
    on the tissue it is stimulating. \n\nTropic hormones are named for their ability
    to act directly on target tissues or other endocrine glands to release hormones,
    causing numerous cascading physiological responses.\n\n\n=== Role in the endocrine
    system ===\n\n\nHypothalamic controlHormone secretion from the anterior pituitary
    gland is regulated by hormones secreted by the hypothalamus. \n\nNeuroendocrine
    cells in the hypothalamus project axons to the median eminence, at the base of
    the brain. \n\nAt this site, these cells can release substances into small blood
    vessels that travel directly to the anterior pituitary gland (the hypothalamo-hypophyseal
    portal vessels).\n\nOther Control MechanismsAside from hypothalamic control of
    the anterior pituitary, other systems in the body have been shown to regulate
    the anterior pituitary\u2019s function. \n\nGABA can either stimulate or inhibit
    the secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH) and growth hormone (GH) and can stimulate
    the secretion of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). \n\nProstaglandins are now
    known to inhibit adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and also to stimulate TSH,
    GH and LH release. \n\nGABA, through action with the hypothalamus, has been shown
    experimentally to influence the level of GH secretion. \n\nClinical evidence
    supports the experimental findings of the excitatory and inhibitory effects GABA
    has on GH secretion, dependent on GABA\u2019s site of action within the hypothalamic-pituitary
    unit.\n\n\n=== Effects of the anterior pituitary ===\n\nThermal homeostasisThe
    homeostatic maintenance of the anterior pituitary is crucial to our physiological
    well being. \n\nIncreased plasma levels of TSH induce hyperthermia through a
    mechanism involving increased metabolism and cutaneous vasodilation. \n\nIncreased
    levels of LH also result in hypothermia but through a decreased metabolism action.
    \n\nACTH increase metabolism and induce cutaneous vasoconstriction, increased
    plasma levels also result in hyperthermia and prolactin decreases with decreasing
    temperature values. \n\nFollicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) also may cause hypothermia
    if increased beyond homeostatic levels through an increased metabolic mechanism
    only.\n\nGonadal function\nGonadotropes, primarily luteinising hormone (LH) secreted
    from the anterior pituitary stimulates the ovulation cycle in female mammals,
    whilst in the males, LH stimulates the synthesis of androgen which drives the
    ongoing will to mate together with a constant production of sperm.\n\nHPA axis\nHypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
    axis\nThe anterior pituitary plays a role in stress response. \n\nCorticotropin
    releasing hormone (CRH) from the hypothalamus stimulates ACTH release in a cascading
    effect that ends with the production of glucocorticoids from the adrenal cortex.\n\n\n===
    Behavioral effects ===\n\nDevelopment\nThe release of GH, LH, and FSH are required
    for correct human development, including gonadal development.\n\nBreast-feeding\nRelease
    of the hormone prolactin is essential for lactation.\nStress\nOperating through
    the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA), the anterior pituitary gland has
    a large role in the neuroendocrine system\u2019s stress response. \n\nStress
    induces a release of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and vasopressin from
    the hypothalamus, which activates the release of adrenocorticotropic hormone
    (ACTH) from the anterior pituitary gland. \n\nThen, this acts on the adrenal
    cortex to produce glucocorticoids such as cortisol. \n\nThese glucocorticoids
    act back on the anterior pituitary gland and the hypothalamus with negative feedback
    to slow the production of CRH and ACTH. \n\nIncreased cortisol under stress conditions
    can cause the following: metabolic effects (mobilization of glucose, fatty acids,
    and amino acids), bone re-absorption (calcium mobilization), activation of the
    sympathetic nervous system response (fight or flight), anti-inflammatory effects,
    and inhibition of reproduction/growth. \n\nWhen the anterior pituitary gland
    is removed (hypophysectomy) in rats, their avoidance learning mechanisms were
    slowed, but injections of ACTH restored their performance. \n\nIn addition, stress
    may delay the release of reproductive hormones such as luteinizing hormone (LH)
    and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). \n\nThis shows that the anterior pituitary
    gland is involved in behavioral functions as well as being part of a larger pathway
    for stress responses. \n\nIt is also known that (HPA) hormones are related to
    certain skin diseases and skin homeostasis. \n\nThere is evidence linking hyperactivity
    of HPA hormones to stress-related skin diseases and skin tumors.\n\nAging\nOperating
    through the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, the anterior pituitary gland
    also affects the reproductive system. \n\nThe hypothalamus releases gonadotropin-releasing
    hormone (GnRH), which stimulates the release of luteinizing hormone (LH) and
    follicle-stimulating hormone. \n\nThen the gonads produce estrogen and testosterone.
    \n\nThe decrease in release of gonadotropins (LH and FSH) caused by normal aging
    may be responsible for impotence and frailty in elderly men because of the eventual
    decrease in production of testosterone. \n\nThis lower level of testosterone
    can have other effects, such as reduced libido, well-being and mood, muscle and
    bone strength, and metabolism.\n\nTactile responding\nIt has been shown that
    infant mice who were stroked with a paintbrush (simulating motherly care) had
    more release and binding of growth hormone (GH) from the anterior pituitary gland.Circadian
    rhythms\n\nLight information received by the eyes is transmitted to the pineal
    gland via the circadian pacemaker (the suprachiasmatic nucleus). \n\nDiminishing
    light stimulates the release of melatonin from the pineal gland which can also
    affect the secretion levels in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. \n\nMelatonin
    can lower levels of LH and FSH, which will decrease levels of estrogen and testosterone.
    \n\nIn addition, melatonin may affect production of prolactin.\n\n\n== Clinical
    significance ==\n\n\n=== Increased activity ===\n\nHyperpituitarism is the condition
    where the pituitary secretes excessive amounts of hormones. \n\nThis hypersecretion
    often results in the formation of a pituitary adenoma (tumour), which are benign
    apart from a tiny fraction. \n\nThere are mainly three types of anterior pituitary
    tumors and their associated disorders. \n\nFor example, acromegaly results from
    excessive secretion of growth hormone (GH) often being released by a pituitary
    adenoma. \n\nThis disorder can cause disfigurement and possibly death and can
    lead to gigantism, a hormone disorder shown in \u201Cgiants\u201D such as Andr\xE9
    the Giant, where it occurs before the epiphyseal plates in bones close in puberty.
    \n\nThe most common type of pituitary tumour is a prolactinoma which hypersecretes
    prolactin. \n\nA third type of pituitary adenoma secretes excess ACTH, which
    in turn, causes an excess of cortisol to be secreted and is the cause of Cushing's
    disease.\n\n\n=== Decreased activity ===\n\n\nHypopituitarism is characterized
    by a decreased secretion of hormones released by the anterior pituitary. \n\nFor
    example, hypo-secretion of GH prior to puberty can be a cause of dwarfism. \n\nIn
    addition, secondary adrenal insufficiency can be caused by hypo-secretion of
    ACTH which, in turn, does not signal the adrenal cortex to produce a sufficient
    amount of cortisol. \n\nThis is a life-threatening condition. \n\nHypopituitarism
    could be caused by the destruction or removal of the anterior pituitary tissue
    through traumatic brain injury, tumor, tuberculosis, or syphilis, among other
    causes. \n\nThis disorder used to be referred to as Simmonds' disease but now
    according to the Diseases Database it is called Sheehan syndrome. \n\nIf the
    hypopituitarism is caused by the blood loss associated with childbirth, the disorder
    is referred to as Sheehan syndrome.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Etymology ===\n\nThe
    anterior pituitary is also known as the adenohypophysis, meaning \"glandular
    undergrowth\", from the Greek adeno- (\"gland\"), hypo (\"under\"), and physis
    (\"growth\").\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_pituitary"

  descriptionText: "\n\nINFERIOR LOBE OF LEFT LUNG/\nLUNG\n\n\nThe lungs are the
    primary organs of the respiratory system in humans and most other animals including
    a few fish, and some snails. \n\nIn mammals and most other vertebrates, two lungs
    are located near the backbone on either side of the heart. \n\nTheir function
    in the respiratory system is to extract oxygen from the air and transfer it into
    the bloodstream, and to release carbon dioxide from the bloodstream into the
    atmosphere, in a process of gas exchange. \n\nRespiration is driven by different
    muscular systems in different species. \n\nMammals, reptiles and birds use their
    different muscles to support and foster breathing. \n\nIn earlier tetrapods,
    air was driven into the lungs by the pharyngeal muscles via buccal pumping, a
    mechanism still seen in amphibians. \n\nIn humans, the main muscle of respiration
    that drives breathing is the diaphragm. \n\nThe lungs also provide airflow that
    makes vocal sounds including human speech possible.\nHumans have two lungs, a
    right lung, and a left lung. \n\nThey are situated within the thoracic cavity
    of the chest. \n\nThe right lung is bigger than the left, which shares space
    in the chest with the heart. \n\nThe lungs together weigh approximately 1.3 kilograms
    (2.9 lb), and the right is heavier. \n\nThe lungs are part of the lower respiratory
    tract that begins at the trachea and branches into the bronchi and bronchioles,
    and which receive air breathed in via the conducting zone. \n\nThe conducting
    zone ends at the terminal bronchioles. \n\nThese divide into the respiratory
    bronchioles of the respiratory zone which divide into alveolar ducts that give
    rise to the alveolar sacs that contain the alveoli, where gas exchange takes
    place. \n\nAlveoli are also sparsely present on the walls of the respiratory
    bronchioles and alveolar ducts. \n\nTogether, the lungs contain approximately
    2,400 kilometres (1,500 mi) of airways and 300 to 500 million alveoli. \n\nEach
    lung is enclosed within a pleural sac of two membranes called pleurae; the membranes
    are separated by a film of pleural fluid, which allows the inner and outer membranes
    to slide over each other whilst breathing takes place, without much friction.
    \n\nThe inner pleura also divides each lung into sections called lobes. \n\nThe
    right lung has three lobes and the left has two. \n\nThe lobes are further divided
    into bronchopulmonary segments and pulmonary lobules. \n\nThe lungs have a unique
    blood supply, receiving deoxygenated blood from the heart in the pulmonary circulation
    for the purposes of receiving oxygen and releasing carbon dioxide, and a separate
    supply of oxygenated blood to the tissue of the lungs, in the bronchial circulation.\nThe
    tissue of the lungs can be affected by a number of respiratory diseases, including
    pneumonia and lung cancer. \n\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease includes
    chronic bronchitis and emphysema, and can be related to smoking or exposure to
    harmful substances. \n\nA number of occupational lung diseases can be caused
    by substances such as coal dust, asbestos fibres, and crystalline silica dust.
    \n\nDiseases such as bronchitis can also affect the respiratory tract. \n\nMedical
    terms related to the lung often begin with pulmo-, from the Latin pulmonarius
    (of the lungs) as in pulmonology, or with pneumo- (from Greek \u03C0\u03BD\u03B5\u03CD\u03BC\u03C9\u03BD
    \"lung\") as in pneumonia.\nIn embryonic development, the lungs begin to develop
    as an outpouching of the foregut, a tube which goes on to form the upper part
    of the digestive system. \n\nWhen the lungs are formed the fetus is held in the
    fluid-filled amniotic sac and so they do not function to breathe. \n\nBlood is
    also diverted from the lungs through the ductus arteriosus. \n\nAt birth however,
    air begins to pass through the lungs, and the diversionary duct closes, so that
    the lungs can begin to respire. \n\nThe lungs only fully develop in early childhood.\n\n\n==
    Structure ==\n\n\n\n=== Anatomy ===\n\n\nThe lungs are located in the chest on
    either side of the heart in the rib cage. \n\nThey are conical in shape with
    a narrow rounded apex at the top, and a broad concave base that rests on the
    convex surface of the diaphragm. \n\nThe apex of the lung extends into the root
    of the neck, reaching shortly above the level of the sternal end of the first
    rib. \n\nThe lungs stretch from close to the backbone in the rib cage to the
    front of the chest and downwards from the lower part of the trachea to the diaphragm.
    \n\nThe left lung shares space with the heart, and has an indentation in its
    border called the cardiac notch of the left lung to accommodate this. \n\nThe
    front and outer sides of the lungs face the ribs, which make light indentations
    on their surfaces. \n\nThe medial surfaces of the lungs face towards the centre
    of the chest, and lie against the heart, great vessels, and the carina where
    the trachea divides into the two main bronchi. \n\nThe cardiac impression is
    an indentation formed on the surfaces of the lungs where they rest against the
    heart.\nBoth lungs have a central recession called the hilum at the root of the
    lung, where the blood vessels and airways pass into the lungs. \n\nThere are
    also bronchopulmonary lymph nodes on the hilum.The lungs are surrounded by the
    pulmonary pleurae. \n\nThe pleurae are two serous membranes; the outer parietal
    pleura lines the inner wall of the rib cage and the inner visceral pleura directly
    lines the surface of the lungs. \n\nBetween the pleurae is a potential space
    called the pleural cavity containing a thin layer of lubricating pleural fluid.\n\n\n====
    Lobes ====\nEach lung is divided into sections called lobes by the infoldings
    of the visceral pleura as fissures. \n\nLobes are divided into segments, and
    segments have further divisions as lobules. \n\nThere are three lobes in the
    right lung and two lobes in the left lung. \n\n\n==== Fissures ====\nThe fissures
    are formed in early prenatal development by invaginations of the visceral pleura
    that divide the lobar bronchi, and section the lungs into lobes that helps in
    their expansion. \n\nThe right lung is divided into three lobes by a horizontal
    fissure, and an oblique fissure. \n\nThe left lung is divided into two lobes
    by an oblique fissure which is closely aligned with the oblique fissure in the
    right lung. \n\nIn the right lung the upper horizontal fissure, separates the
    upper (superior) lobe from the middle lobe. \n\nThe lower, oblique fissure separates
    the lower lobe from the middle and upper lobes.Variations in the fissures are
    fairly common being either incompletely formed \nor present as an extra fissure
    as in the azygos fissure, or absent. \n\nIncomplete fissures are responsible
    for interlobar collateral ventilation, airflow between lobes which is unwanted
    in some lung volume reduction procedures.\n\n\n==== Segments ====\nThe main or
    primary bronchi enter the lungs at the hilum and initially branch into secondary
    bronchi also known as lobar bronchi that supply air to each lobe of the lung.
    \n\nThe lobar bronchi branch into tertiary bronchi also known as segmental bronchi
    and these supply air to the further divisions of the lobes known as bronchopulmonary
    segments. \n\nEach bronchopulmonary segment has its own (segmental) bronchus
    and arterial supply. \n\nSegments for the left and right lung are shown in the
    table. \n\nThe segmental anatomy is useful clinically for localising disease
    processes in the lungs. \n\nA segment is a discrete unit that can be surgically
    removed without seriously affecting surrounding tissue.\n\n\n=== Right lung ===\n\nThe
    right lung has both more lobes and segments than the left. \n\nIt is divided
    into three lobes, an upper, middle, and a lower lobe by two fissures, one oblique
    and one horizontal. \n\nThe upper, horizontal fissure, separates the upper from
    the middle lobe. \n\nIt begins in the lower oblique fissure near the posterior
    border of the lung, and, running horizontally forward, cuts the anterior border
    on a level with the sternal end of the fourth costal cartilage; on the mediastinal
    surface it may be traced back to the hilum. \n\nThe lower, oblique fissure, separates
    the lower from the middle and upper lobes and is closely aligned with the oblique
    fissure in the left lung.The mediastinal surface of the right lung is indented
    by a number of nearby structures. \n\nThe heart sits in an impression called
    the cardiac impression. \n\nAbove the hilum of the lung is an arched groove for
    the azygos vein, and above this is a wide groove for the superior vena cava and
    right brachiocephalic vein; behind this, and close to the top of the lung is
    a groove for the brachiocephalic artery. \n\nThere is a groove for the esophagus
    behind the hilum and the pulmonary ligament, and near the lower part of the esophageal
    groove is a deeper groove for the inferior vena cava before it enters the heart.The
    weight of the right lung varies between individuals, with a standard reference
    range in men of 155\u2013720 g (0.342\u20131.587 lb) and in women of 100\u2013590
    g (0.22\u20131.30 lb).\n\n\n=== Left lung ===\n\nThe left lung is divided into
    two lobes, an upper and a lower lobe, by the oblique fissure, which extends from
    the costal to the mediastinal surface of the lung both above and below the hilum.
    \n\nThe left lung, unlike the right, does not have a middle lobe, though it does
    have a homologous feature, a projection of the upper lobe termed the lingula.
    \n\nIts name means \"little tongue\". \n\nThe lingula on the left lung serves
    as an anatomic parallel to the middle lobe on the right lung, with both areas
    being predisposed to similar infections and anatomic complications. \n\nThere
    are two bronchopulmonary segments of the lingula: superior and inferior.The mediastinal
    surface of the left lung has a large cardiac impression where the heart sits.
    \n\nThis is deeper and larger than that on the right lung, at which level the
    heart projects to the left.On the same surface, immediately above the hilum,
    is a well-marked curved groove for the aortic arch, and a groove below it for
    the descending aorta. \n\nThe left subclavian artery, a branch off the aortic
    arch, sits in a groove from the arch to near the apex of the lung. \n\nA shallower
    groove in front of the artery and near the edge of the lung, lodges the left
    brachiocephalic vein. \n\nThe esophagus may sit in a wider shallow impression
    at the base of the lung.The weight of the left lung, by standard reference range,
    in men is 110\u2013675 g (0.243\u20131.488 lb) in women 105\u2013515 g (0.231\u20131.135
    lb).\n\n\n== Microanatomy ==\n\n\nThe lungs are part of the lower respiratory
    tract, and accommodate the bronchial airways when they branch from the trachea.
    \n\nThe bronchial airways terminate in alveoli which make up the functional tissue
    (parenchyma) of the lung, and veins, arteries, nerves, and lymphatic vessels.
    \n\nThe trachea and bronchi have plexuses of lymph capillaries in their mucosa
    and submucosa. \n\nThe smaller bronchi have a single layer of lymph capillaries,
    and they are absent in the alveoli. \n\nThe lungs are supplied with the largest
    lymphatic drainage system of any other organ in the body. \n\nEach lung is surrounded
    by a serous membrane of visceral pleura, which has an underlying layer of loose
    connective tissue attached to the substance of the lung.\n\n\n=== Connective
    tissue ===\n\nThe connective tissue of the lungs is made up of elastic and collagen
    fibres that are interspersed between the capillaries and the alveolar walls.
    \n\nElastin is the key protein of the extracellular matrix and is the main component
    of the elastic fibres. \n\nElastin gives the necessary elasticity and resilience
    required for the persistent stretching involved in breathing, known as lung compliance.
    \n\nIt is also responsible for the elastic recoil needed. \n\nElastin is more
    concentrated in areas of high stress such as the openings of the alveoli, and
    alveolar junctions. \n\nThe connective tissue links all the alveoli to form the
    lung parenchyma which has a sponge-like appearance. \n\nThe alveoli have interconnecting
    air passages in their walls known as the pores of Kohn.\n\n\n=== Respiratory
    epithelium ===\n\n\nAll of the lower respiratory tract including the trachea,
    bronchi, and bronchioles is lined with respiratory epithelium. \n\nThis is a
    ciliated epithelium interspersed with goblet cells which produce mucin the main
    component of mucus, ciliated cells, basal cells, and in the terminal bronchioles\u2013club
    cells with actions similar to basal cells, and macrophages. \n\nThe epithelial
    cells, and the submucosal glands throughout the respiratory tract secrete airway
    surface liquid (ASL), the composition of which is tightly regulated and determines
    how well mucociliary clearance works.Pulmonary neuroendocrine cells are found
    throughout the respiratory epithelium including the alveolar epithelium, though
    they only account for around 0.5 per cent of the total epithelial population.
    \n\nPNECs are innervated airway epithelial cells that are particularly focused
    at airway junction points. \n\nThese cells can produce serotonin, dopamine, and
    norepinephrine, as well as polypeptide products. \n\nCytoplasmic processes from
    the pulmonary neuroendocrine cells extend into the airway lumen where they may
    sense the composition of inspired gas.\n\n\n=== Bronchial airways ===\n\nIn the
    bronchi there are incomplete tracheal rings of cartilage and smaller plates of
    cartilage that keep them open.:\u200A472\u200A Bronchioles are too narrow to
    support cartilage and their walls are of smooth muscle, and this is largely absent
    in the narrower respiratory bronchioles which are mainly just of epithelium.:\u200A472\u200A
    The absence of cartilage in the terminal bronchioles gives them an alternative
    name of membranous bronchioles.\n\n\n=== Respiratory zone ===\n\nThe conducting
    zone of the respiratory tract ends at the terminal bronchioles when they branch
    into the respiratory bronchioles. \n\nThis marks the beginning of the terminal
    respiratory unit called the acinus which includes the respiratory bronchioles,
    the alveolar ducts, alveolar sacs, and alveoli. \n\nAn acinus measures up to
    10 mm in diameter. \n\nA primary pulmonary lobule is that part of the acinus
    that includes the alveolar ducts, sacs, and alveoli but does not include the
    respiratory bronchioles. \n\nThe unit described as the secondary pulmonary lobule
    is the lobule most referred to as the pulmonary lobule or respiratory lobule.:\u200A489\u200A
    This lobule is a discrete unit that is the smallest component of the lung that
    can be seen without aid. \n\nThe secondary pulmonary lobule is likely to be made
    up of between 30 and 50 primary lobules. \n\nThe lobule is supplied by a terminal
    bronchiole that branches into respiratory bronchioles. \n\nThe respiratory bronchioles
    supply the alveoli in each acinus and is accompanied by a pulmonary artery branch.
    \n\nEach lobule is enclosed by an interlobular septa. \n\nEach acinus is incompletely
    separated by an interlobular septa.The respiratory bronchiole gives rise to the
    alveolar ducts that lead to the alveolar sacs, which contain two or more alveoli.
    \n\nThe walls of the alveoli are extremely thin allowing a fast rate of diffusion.
    \n\nThe alveoli have interconnecting small air passages in their walls known
    as the pores of Kohn.\n\n\n=== Alveoli ===\n\n\nAlveoli consist of two types
    of alveolar cell and an alveolar macrophage. \n\nThe two types of cell are known
    as type I and type II cells (also known as pneumocytes). \n\nTypes I and II make
    up the walls and alveolar septa. \n\nType I cells provide 95% of the surface
    area of each alveoli and are flat (\"squamous\"), and Type II cells generally
    cluster in the corners of the alveoli and have a cuboidal shape. \n\nDespite
    this, cells occur in a roughly equal ratio of 1:1 or 6:4.Type I are squamous
    epithelial cells that make up the alveolar wall structure. \n\nThey have extremely
    thin walls that enable an easy gas exchange. \n\nThese type I cells also make
    up the alveolar septa which separate each alveolus. \n\nThe septa consist of
    an epithelial lining and associated basement membranes. \n\nType I cells are
    not able to divide, and consequently rely on differentiation from Type II cells.Type
    II are larger and they line the alveoli and produce and secrete epithelial lining
    fluid, and lung surfactant. \n\nType II cells are able to divide and differentiate
    to Type I cells.The alveolar macrophages have an important role in the immune
    system. \n\nThey remove substances which deposit in the alveoli including loose
    red blood cells that have been forced out from blood vessels.\n\n\n=== Microbiota
    ===\n\n\nThere is a large presence of microorganisms in the lungs known as the
    lung microbiota that interacts with the airway epithelial cells; an interaction
    of probable importance in maintaining homeostasis. \n\nThe microbiota is complex
    and dynamic in healthy people, and altered in diseases such as asthma and COPD.
    \n\nFor example significant changes can take place in COPD following infection
    with rhinovirus. \n\nFungal genera that are commonly found as mycobiota in the
    microbiota include Candida, Malassezia, Saccharomyces, and Aspergillus.\n\n\n===
    Respiratory tract ===\n\n\nThe lower respiratory tract is part of the respiratory
    system, and consists of the trachea and the structures below this including the
    lungs. \n\nThe trachea receives air from the pharynx and travels down to a place
    where it splits (the carina) into a right and left primary bronchus. \n\nThese
    supply air to the right and left lungs, splitting progressively into the secondary
    and tertiary bronchi for the lobes of the lungs, and into smaller and smaller
    bronchioles until they become the respiratory bronchioles. \n\nThese in turn
    supply air through alveolar ducts into the alveoli, where the exchange of gases
    take place. \n\nOxygen breathed in, diffuses through the walls of the alveoli
    into the enveloping capillaries and into the circulation, and carbon dioxide
    diffuses from the blood into the lungs to be breathed out.\nEstimates of the
    total surface area of lungs vary from 50 to 75 square metres (540 to 810 sq ft);
    although this is often quoted in textbooks and the media being \"the size of
    a tennis court\", it is actually less than half the size of a singles court.The
    bronchi in the conducting zone are reinforced with hyaline cartilage in order
    to hold open the airways. \n\nThe bronchioles have no cartilage and are surrounded
    instead by smooth muscle. \n\nAir is warmed to 37 \xB0C (99 \xB0F), humidified
    and cleansed by the conducting zone. \n\nParticles from the air being removed
    by the cilia on the respiratory epithelium lining the passageways, in a process
    called mucociliary clearance.\nPulmonary stretch receptors in the smooth muscle
    of the airways initiate a reflex known as the Hering\u2013Breuer reflex that
    prevents the lungs from over-inflation, during forceful inspiration.\n\n\n===
    Blood supply ===\n\n\nThe lungs have a dual blood supply provided by a bronchial
    and a pulmonary circulation. \n\nThe bronchial circulation supplies oxygenated
    blood to the airways of the lungs, through the bronchial arteries that leave
    the aorta. \n\nThere are usually three arteries, two to the left lung and one
    to the right, and they branch alongside the bronchi and bronchioles. \n\nThe
    pulmonary circulation carries deoxygenated blood from the heart to the lungs
    and returns the oxygenated blood to the heart to supply the rest of the body.The
    blood volume of the lungs is about 450 millilitres on average, about 9% of the
    total blood volume of the entire circulatory system. \n\nThis quantity can easily
    fluctuate from between one-half and twice the normal volume. \n\nAlso, in the
    event of blood loss through hemorrhage, blood from the lungs can partially compensate
    by automatically transferring to the systemic circulation.\n\n\n=== Nerve supply
    ===\n\nThe lungs are supplied by nerves of the autonomic nervous system. \n\nInput
    from the parasympathetic nervous system occurs via the vagus nerve. \n\nWhen
    stimulated by acetylcholine, this causes constriction of the smooth muscle lining
    the bronchus and bronchioles, and increases the secretions from glands. \n\nThe
    lungs also have a sympathetic tone from norepinephrine acting on the beta 2 adrenoceptors
    in the respiratory tract, which causes bronchodilation.The action of breathing
    takes place because of nerve signals sent by the respiratory center in the brainstem,
    along the phrenic nerve from the cervical plexus to the diaphragm.\n\n\n=== Variation
    ===\n\nThe lobes of the lung are subject to anatomical variations. \n\nA horizontal
    interlobar fissure was found to be incomplete in 25% of right lungs, or even
    absent in 11% of all cases. \n\nAn accessory fissure was also found in 14% and
    22% of left and right lungs, respectively. \n\nAn oblique fissure was found to
    be incomplete in 21% to 47% of left lungs. \n\nIn some cases a fissure is absent,
    or extra, resulting in a right lung with only two lobes, or a left lung with
    three lobes.A variation in the airway branching structure has been found specifically
    in the central airway\nbranching. \n\nThis variation is associated with the development
    of COPD in adulthood.\n\n\n== Development ==\n\n\nThe development of the human
    lungs arise from the laryngotracheal groove and develop to maturity over several
    weeks in the foetus and for several years following birth.The larynx, trachea,
    bronchi and lungs that make up the respiratory tract, begin to form during the
    fourth week of embryogenesis from the lung bud which appears ventrally to the
    caudal portion of the foregut.\n\nThe respiratory tract has a branching structure,
    and is also known as the respiratory tree. \n\nIn the embryo this structure is
    developed in the process of branching morphogenesis, and is generated by the
    repeated splitting of the tip of the branch. \n\nIn the development of the lungs
    (as in some other organs) the epithelium forms branching tubes. \n\nThe lung
    has a left-right symmetry and each bud known as a bronchial bud grows out as
    a tubular epithelium that becomes a bronchus. \n\nEach bronchus branches into
    bronchioles. \n\nThe branching is a result of the tip of each tube bifurcating.
    \n\nThe branching process forms the bronchi, bronchioles, and ultimately the
    alveoli. \n\nThe four genes mostly associated with branching morphogenesis in
    the lung are the intercellular signalling protein \u2013 sonic hedgehog (SHH),
    fibroblast growth factors FGF10 and FGFR2b, and bone morphogenetic protein BMP4.
    \n\nFGF10 is seen to have the most prominent role. \n\nFGF10 is a paracrine signalling
    molecule needed for epithelial branching, and SHH inhibits FGF10. \n\nThe development
    of the alveoli is influenced by a different mechanism whereby continued bifurcation
    is stopped and the distal tips become dilated to form the alveoli.\nAt the end
    of the fourth week the lung bud divides into two, the right and left primary
    bronchial buds on each side of the trachea. \n\nDuring the fifth week the right
    bud branches into three secondary bronchial buds and the left branches into two
    secondary bronchial buds. \n\nThese give rise to the lobes of the lungs, three
    on the right and two on the left. \n\nOver the following week, the secondary
    buds branch into tertiary buds, about ten on each side. \n\nFrom the sixth week
    to the sixteenth week, the major elements of the lungs appear except the alveoli.
    \n\nFrom week 16 to week 26, the bronchi enlarge and lung tissue becomes highly
    vascularised. \n\nBronchioles and alveolar ducts also develop. \n\nBy week 26
    the terminal bronchioles have formed which branch into two respiratory bronchioles.
    \n\nDuring the period covering the 26th week until birth the important blood\u2013air
    barrier is established. \n\nSpecialised type I alveolar cells where gas exchange
    will take place, together with the type II alveolar cells that secrete pulmonary
    surfactant, appear. \n\nThe surfactant reduces the surface tension at the air-alveolar
    surface which allows expansion of the alveolar sacs. \n\nThe alveolar sacs contain
    the primitive alveoli that form at the end of the alveolar ducts,\nand their
    appearance around the seventh month marks the point at which limited respiration
    would be possible, and the premature baby could survive.\n\n\n=== Vitamin A deficiency
    ===\n\n\nThe developing lung is particularly vulnerable to changes in the levels
    of vitamin A. \n\nVitamin A deficiency has been linked to changes in the epithelial
    lining of the lung and in the lung parenchyma. \n\nThis can disrupt the normal
    physiology of the lung and predispose to respiratory diseases. \n\nSevere nutritional
    deficiency in vitamin A results in a reduction in the formation of the alveolar
    walls (septa) and to notable changes in the respiratory epithelium; alterations
    are noted in the extracellular matrix and in the protein content of the basement
    membrane. \n\nThe extracellular matrix maintains lung elasticity; the basement
    membrane is associated with alveolar epithelium and is important in the blood-air
    barrier. \n\nThe deficiency is associated with functional defects and disease
    states. \n\nVitamin A is crucial in the development of the alveoli which continues
    for several years after birth.\n\n\n=== After birth ===\n\nAt birth, the baby's
    lungs are filled with fluid secreted by the lungs and are not inflated. \n\nAfter
    birth the infant's central nervous system reacts to the sudden change in temperature
    and environment. \n\nThis triggers the first breath, within about 10 seconds
    after delivery. \n\nBefore birth, the lungs are filled with fetal lung fluid.  
    After the first breath, the fluid is quickly absorbed into the body or exhaled.
    \n\nThe resistance in the lung's blood vessels decreases giving an increased
    surface area for gas exchange, and the lungs begin to breathe spontaneously.
    \n\nThis accompanies other changes which result in an increased amount of blood
    entering the lung tissues.At birth the lungs are very undeveloped with only around
    one sixth of the alveoli of the adult lung present. \n\nThe alveoli continue
    to form into early adulthood, and their ability to form when necessary is seen
    in the regeneration of the lung. \n\nAlveolar septa have a double capillary network
    instead of the single network of the developed lung. \n\nOnly after the maturation
    of the capillary network can the lung enter a normal phase of growth. \n\nFollowing
    the early growth in numbers of alveoli there is another stage of the alveoli
    being enlarged.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\n\n\n=== Gas exchange ===\n\nThe major
    function of the lungs is gas exchange between the lungs and the blood. \n\nThe
    alveolar and pulmonary capillary gases equilibrate across the thin blood\u2013air
    barrier. \n\nThis thin membrane (about 0.5 \u20132 \u03BCm thick) is folded into
    about 300 million alveoli, providing an extremely large surface area (estimates
    varying between 70 and 145 m2) for gas exchange to occur.\n\nThe lungs are not
    capable of expanding to breathe on their own, and will only do so when there
    is an increase in the volume of the thoracic cavity. \n\nThis is achieved by
    the muscles of respiration, through the contraction of the diaphragm, and the
    intercostal muscles which pull the rib cage upwards as shown in the diagram.
    \n\nDuring breathing out the muscles relax, returning the lungs to their resting
    position. \n\nAt this point the lungs contain the functional residual capacity
    (FRC) of air, which, in the adult human, has a volume of about 2.5\u20133.0 litres.During
    heavy breathing as in exertion, a large number of accessory muscles in the neck
    and abdomen are recruited, that during exhalation pull the ribcage down, decreasing
    the volume of the thoracic cavity. \n\nThe FRC is now decreased, but since the
    lungs cannot be emptied completely there is still about a litre of residual air
    left. \n\nLung function testing is carried out to evaluate lung volumes and capacities.\n\n\n===
    Protection ===\n\nThe lungs possess several characteristics which protect against
    infection. \n\nThe respiratory tract is lined by respiratory epithelium or respiratory
    mucosa, with hair-like projections called cilia that beat rhythmically and carry
    mucus. \n\nThis mucociliary clearance is an important defence system against
    air-borne infection. \n\nThe dust particles and bacteria in the inhaled air are
    caught in the mucosal surface of the airways, and are moved up towards the pharynx
    by the rhythmic upward beating action of the cilia.:\u200A661\u2013730\u200A
    The lining of the lung also secretes immunoglobulin A which protects against
    respiratory infections; goblet cells secrete mucus which also contains several
    antimicrobial compounds such as defensins, antiproteases, and antioxidants. \n\nA
    rare type of specialised cell called a pulmonary ionocyte that is suggested may
    regulate mucus viscosity has been described. \n\nIn addition, the lining of the
    lung also contains macrophages, immune cells which engulf and destroy debris
    and microbes that enter the lung in a process known as phagocytosis; and dendritic
    cells which present antigens to activate components of the adaptive immune system
    such as T cells and B cells.The size of the respiratory tract and the flow of
    air also protect the lungs from larger particles. \n\nSmaller particles deposit
    in the mouth and behind the mouth in the oropharynx, and larger particles are
    trapped in nasal hair after inhalation.\n\n\n=== Other ===\n\nIn addition to
    their function in respiration, the lungs have a number of other functions. \n\nThey
    are involved in maintaining homeostasis, helping in the regulation of blood pressure
    as part of the renin\u2013angiotensin system. \n\nThe inner lining of the blood
    vessels secretes angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) an enzyme that catalyses
    the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. \n\nThe lungs are involved
    in the blood's acid\u2013base homeostasis by expelling carbon dioxide when breathing.The
    lungs also serve a protective role. \n\nSeveral blood-borne substances, such
    as a few types of prostaglandins, leukotrienes, serotonin and bradykinin, are
    excreted through the lungs. \n\nDrugs and other substances can be absorbed, modified
    or excreted in the lungs. \n\nThe lungs filter out small blood clots from veins
    and prevent them from entering arteries and causing strokes.The lungs also play
    a pivotal role in speech by providing air and airflow for the creation of vocal
    sounds, and other paralanguage communications such as sighs and gasps.\nResearch
    suggests a role of the lungs in the production of blood platelets.\n\n\n== Gene
    and protein expression ==\n\n\nAbout 20,000 protein coding genes are expressed
    in human cells and almost 75% of these genes are expressed in the normal lung.
    \n\nA little less than 200 of these genes are more specifically expressed in
    the lung with less than 20 genes being highly lung specific. \n\nThe highest
    expression of lung specific proteins are different surfactant proteins, such
    as SFTPA1, SFTPB and SFTPC, and napsin, expressed in type II pneumocytes. \n\nOther
    proteins with elevated expression in the lung are the dynein protein DNAH5 in
    ciliated cells, and the secreted SCGB1A1 protein in mucus-secreting goblet cells
    of the airway mucosa.\n\n\n== Clinical significance ==\n\n\nLungs can be affected
    by a number of diseases and disorders. \n\nPulmonology is the medical speciality
    that deals with respiratory diseases involving the lungs and respiratory system.
    \n\nCardiothoracic surgery deals with surgery of the lungs including lung volume
    reduction surgery, lobectomy, pneumectomy and lung transplantation.\n\n\n===
    Inflammation and infection ===\n\nInflammatory conditions of the lung tissue
    are pneumonia, of the respiratory tract are bronchitis and bronchiolitis, and
    of the pleurae surrounding the lungs pleurisy. \n\nInflammation is usually caused
    by infections due to bacteria or viruses. \n\nWhen the lung tissue is inflamed
    due to other causes it is called pneumonitis. \n\nOne major cause of bacterial
    pneumonia is tuberculosis. \n\nChronic infections often occur in those with immunodeficiency
    and can include a fungal infection by Aspergillus fumigatus that can lead to
    an aspergilloma forming in the lung.Alcohol affects the lungs and can cause inflammatory
    alcoholic lung disease. \n\nAcute exposure to alcohol stimulates the beating
    of cilia in the respiratory epithelium. \n\nHowever, chronic exposure has the
    effect of desensitising the ciliary response which reduces mucociliary clearance
    (MCC). \n\nMCC is an innate defense system protecting against pollutants and
    pathogens, and when this is disrupted the numbers of alveolar macrophages are
    decreased. \n\nA subsequent inflammatory response is the release of cytokines.
    \n\nAnother consequence is the susceptibility to infection.\n\n\n=== Blood-supply
    changes ===\n\n\nA pulmonary embolism is a blood clot that becomes lodged in
    the pulmonary arteries. \n\nThe majority of emboli arise because of deep vein
    thrombosis in the legs. \n\nPulmonary emboli may be investigated using a ventilation/perfusion
    scan, a CT scan of the arteries of the lung, or blood tests such as the D-dimer.
    \n\nPulmonary hypertension describes an increased pressure at the beginning of
    the pulmonary artery that has a large number of differing causes. \n\nOther rarer
    conditions may also affect the blood supply of the lung, such as granulomatosis
    with polyangiitis, which causes inflammation of the small blood vessels of the
    lungs and kidneys.A lung contusion is a bruise caused by chest trauma. \n\nIt
    results in hemorrhage of the alveoli causing a build-up of fluid which can impair
    breathing, and this can be either mild or severe.\nThe function of the lungs
    can also be affected by compression from fluid in the pleural cavity pleural
    effusion, or other substances such as air (pneumothorax), blood (hemothorax),
    or rarer causes. \n\nThese may be investigated using a chest X-ray or CT scan,
    and may require the insertion of a surgical drain until the underlying cause
    is identified and treated.\n\n\n=== Obstructive lung diseases ===\n\n\nAsthma,
    chronic bronchitis, bronchiectasis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
    (COPD) are all obstructive lung diseases characterised by airway obstruction.
    \n\nThis limits the amount of air that is able to enter alveoli because of constriction
    of the bronchial tree, due to inflammation. \n\nObstructive lung diseases are
    often identified because of symptoms and diagnosed with pulmonary function tests
    such as spirometry. \n\nMany obstructive lung diseases are managed by avoiding
    triggers (such as dust mites or smoking), with symptom control such as bronchodilators,
    and with suppression of inflammation (such as through corticosteroids) in severe
    cases. \n\nA common cause of chronic bronchitis, and emphysema, is smoking; and
    common causes of bronchiectasis include severe infections and cystic fibrosis.
    \n\nThe definitive cause of asthma is not yet known.The breakdown of alveolar
    tissue, often as a result of tobacco-smoking leads to emphysema, which can become
    severe enough to develop into COPD. \n\nElastase breaks down the elastin in the
    lung's connective tissue that can also result in emphysema. \n\nElastase is inhibited
    by the acute-phase protein, alpha-1 antitrypsin, and when there is a deficiency
    in this, emphysema can develop. \n\nWith persistent stress from smoking, the
    airway basal cells become disarranged and lose their regenerative ability needed
    to repair the epithelial barrier. \n\nThe disorganised basal cells are seen to
    be responsible for the major airway changes that are characteristic of COPD,
    and with continued stress can undergo a malignant transformation. \n\nStudies
    have shown that the initial development of emphysema is centred on the early
    changes in the airway epithelium of the small airways. \n\nBasal cells become
    further deranged in a smoker's transition to clinically defined COPD.\n\n\n===
    Restrictive lung diseases ===\n\nSome types of chronic lung diseases are classified
    as restrictive lung disease, because of a restriction in the amount of lung tissue
    involved in respiration. \n\nThese include pulmonary fibrosis which can occur
    when the lung is inflamed for a long period of time. \n\nFibrosis in the lung
    replaces functioning lung tissue with fibrous connective tissue. \n\nThis can
    be due to a large variety of occupational lung diseases such as Coalworker's
    pneumoconiosis, autoimmune diseases or more rarely to a reaction to medication.
    \n\nSevere respiratory disorders, where spontaneous breathing is not enough to
    maintain life, may need the use of mechanical ventilation to ensure an adequate
    supply of air.\n\n\n=== Cancers ===\n\nLung cancer can either arise directly
    from lung tissue or as a result of metastasis from another part of the body.
    \n\nThere are two main types of primary tumour described as either small-cell
    or non-small-cell lung carcinomas. \n\nThe major risk factor for cancer is smoking.
    \n\nOnce a cancer is identified it is staged using scans such as a CT scan and
    a sample of tissue from a biopsy is taken. \n\nCancers may be treated surgically
    by removing the tumour, the use of radiotherapy, chemotherapy or a combination,
    or with the aim of symptom control. \n\nLung cancer screening is being recommended
    in the United States for high-risk populations.\n\n\n=== Congenital disorders
    ===\n\nCongenital disorders include cystic fibrosis, pulmonary hypoplasia (an
    incomplete development of the lungs)congenital diaphragmatic hernia, and infant
    respiratory distress syndrome caused by a deficiency in lung surfactant. \n\nAn
    azygos lobe is a congenital anatomical variation which though usually without
    effect can cause problems in thoracoscopic procedures.\n\n\n=== Others ===\n\nA
    pneumothorax (collapsed lung) is an abnormal collection of air in the pleural
    space that causes an uncoupling of the lung from the chest wall. \n\nThe lung
    cannot expand against the air pressure inside the pleural space. \n\nAn easy
    to understand example is a traumatic pneumothorax, where air enters the pleural
    space from outside the body, as occurs with puncture to the chest wall. \n\nSimilarly,
    scuba divers ascending while holding their breath with their lungs fully inflated
    can cause air sacs (alveoli) to burst and leak high pressure air into the pleural
    space.\n\n\n=== Lung examination ===\n\n\nAs part of a physical examination in
    response to respiratory symptoms of shortness of breath, and cough, a lung examination
    may be carried out. \n\nThis exam includes palpation and auscultation. \n\nThe
    areas of the lungs that can be listened to using a stethoscope are called the
    lung fields, and these are the posterior, lateral, and anterior lung fields.
    \n\nThe posterior fields can be listened to from the back and include: the lower
    lobes (taking up three quarters of the posterior fields); the anterior fields
    taking up the other quarter; and the lateral fields under the axillae, the left
    axilla for the lingual, the right axilla for the middle right lobe. \n\nThe anterior
    fields can also be auscultated from the front. \n\nAbnormal breathing sounds
    heard during a lung exam can indicate the presence of a lung condition; wheezing
    for example is commonly associated with asthma and COPD.\n\n\n=== Lung function
    testing ===\n\n\nLung function testing is carried out by evaluating a person's
    capacity to inhale and exhale in different circumstances. \n\nThe volume of air
    inhaled and exhaled by a person at rest is the tidal volume (normally 500-750mL);
    the inspiratory reserve volume and expiratory reserve volume are the additional
    amounts a person is able to forcibly inhale and exhale respectively. \n\nThe
    summed total of forced inspiration and expiration is a person's vital capacity.
    \n\nNot all air is expelled from the lungs even after a forced breath out; the
    remainder of the air is called the residual volume. \n\nTogether these terms
    are referred to as lung volumes.Pulmonary plethysmographs are used to measure
    functional residual capacity. \n\nFunctional residual capacity cannot be measured
    by tests that rely on breathing out, as a person is only able to breathe a maximum
    of 80% of their total functional capacity. \n\nThe total lung capacity depends
    on the person's age, height, weight, and sex, and normally ranges between 4 and
    6 litres. \n\nFemales tend to have a 20\u201325% lower capacity than males. \n\nTall
    people tend to have a larger total lung capacity than shorter people. \n\nSmokers
    have a lower capacity than nonsmokers. \n\nThinner persons tend to have a larger
    capacity. \n\nLung capacity can be increased by physical training as much as
    40% but the effect may be modified by exposure to air pollution.Other lung function
    tests include spirometry, measuring the amount (volume) and flow of air that
    can be inhaled and exhaled. \n\nThe maximum volume of breath that can be exhaled
    is called the vital capacity. \n\nIn particular, how much a person is able to
    exhale in one second (called forced expiratory volume (FEV1)) as a proportion
    of how much they are able to exhale in total (FEV). \n\nThis ratio, the FEV1/FEV
    ratio, is important to distinguish whether a lung disease is restrictive or obstructive.
    \n\nAnother test is that of the lung's diffusing capacity \u2013 this is a measure
    of the transfer of gas from air to the blood in the lung capillaries.\n\n\n==
    Other animals ==\n\n\n\n=== Birds ===\n\n\n \nThe lungs of birds are relatively
    small, but are connected to 8 or 9 air sacs that extend through much of the body,
    and are in turn connected to air spaces within the bones. \n\nOn inhalation,
    air travels through the trachea of a bird into the air sacs. \n\nAir then travels
    continuously from the air sacs at the back, through the lungs, which are relatively
    fixed in size, to the air sacs at the front. \n\nFrom here, the air is exhaled.
    \n\nThese fixed size lungs are called \"circulatory lungs\", as distinct from
    the \"bellows-type lungs\" found in most other animals.The lungs of birds contain
    millions of tiny parallel passages called parabronchi. \n\nSmall sacs called
    atria radiate from the walls of the tiny passages; these, like the alveoli in
    other lungs, are the site of gas exchange by simple diffusion. \n\nThe blood
    flow around the parabronchi and their atria forms a cross-current process of
    gas exchange (see diagram on the right).The air sacs, which hold air, do not
    contribute much to gas exchange, despite being thin-walled, as they are poorly
    vascularised. \n\nThe air sacs expand and contract due to changes in the volume
    in the thorax and abdomen. \n\nThis volume change is caused by the movement of
    the sternum and ribs and this movement is often synchronised with movement of
    the flight muscles.Parabronchi in which the air flow is unidirectional are called
    paleopulmonic parabronchi and are found in all birds. \n\nSome birds, however,
    have, in addition, a lung structure where the air flow in the parabronchi is
    bidirectional. \n\nThese are termed neopulmonic parabronchi.\n\n\n=== Reptiles
    ===\n\n\nThe lungs of most reptiles have a single bronchus running down the centre,
    from which numerous branches reach out to individual pockets throughout the lungs.
    \n\nThese pockets are similar to alveoli in mammals, but much larger and fewer
    in number. \n\nThese give the lung a sponge-like texture. \n\nIn tuataras, snakes,
    and some lizards, the lungs are simpler in structure, similar to that of typical
    amphibians.Snakes and limbless lizards typically possess only the right lung
    as a major respiratory organ; the left lung is greatly reduced, or even absent.
    \n\nAmphisbaenians, however, have the opposite arrangement, with a major left
    lung, and a reduced or absent right lung.Both crocodilians and monitor lizards
    have developed lungs similar to those of birds, providing a unidirectional airflow
    and even possessing air sacs. \n\nThe now extinct pterosaurs have seemingly even
    further refined this type of lung, extending the airsacs into the wing membranes
    and, in the case of lonchodectids, tupuxuara, and azhdarchoids, the hindlimbs.Reptilian
    lungs typically receive air via expansion and contraction of the ribs driven
    by axial muscles and buccal pumping. \n\nCrocodilians also rely on the hepatic
    piston method, in which the liver is pulled back by a muscle anchored to the
    pubic bone (part of the pelvis) called the diaphragmaticus, which in turn creates
    negative pressure in the crocodile's thoracic cavity, allowing air to be moved
    into the lungs by Boyle's law. \n\nTurtles, which are unable to move their ribs,
    instead use their forelimbs and pectoral girdle to force air in and out of the
    lungs.\n\n\n=== Amphibians ===\n\n\nThe lungs of most frogs and other amphibians
    are simple and balloon-like, with gas exchange limited to the outer surface of
    the lung. \n\nThis is not very efficient, but amphibians have low metabolic demands
    and can also quickly dispose of carbon dioxide by diffusion across their skin
    in water, and supplement their oxygen supply by the same method. \n\nAmphibians
    employ a positive pressure system to get air to their lungs, forcing air down
    into the lungs by buccal pumping. \n\nThis is distinct from most higher vertebrates,
    who use a breathing system driven by negative pressure where the lungs are inflated
    by expanding the rib cage. \n\nIn buccal pumping, the floor of the mouth is lowered,
    filling the mouth cavity with air. \n\nThe throat muscles then presses the throat
    against the underside of the skull, forcing the air into the lungs.Due to the
    possibility of respiration across the skin combined with small size, all known
    lungless tetrapods are amphibians. \n\nThe majority of salamander species are
    lungless salamanders, which respirate through their skin and tissues lining their
    mouth. \n\nThis necessarily restricts their size: all are small and rather thread-like
    in appearance, maximising skin surface relative to body volume. \n\nOther known
    lungless tetrapods are the Bornean flat-headed frog and Atretochoana eiselti,
    a caecilian.The lungs of amphibians typically have a few narrow internal walls
    (septa) of soft tissue around the outer walls, increasing the respiratory surface
    area and giving the lung a honeycomb appearance. \n\nIn some salamanders even
    these are lacking, and the lung has a smooth wall. \n\nIn caecilians, as in snakes,
    only the right lung attains any size or development.\n\n\n=== Lungfish ===\n\nThe
    lungs of lungfish are similar to those of amphibians, with few, if any, internal
    septa. \n\nIn the Australian lungfish, there is only a single lung, albeit divided
    into two lobes. \n\nOther lungfish and Polypterus, however, have two lungs, which
    are located in the upper part of the body, with the connecting duct curving around
    and above the esophagus. \n\nThe blood supply also twists around the esophagus,
    suggesting that the lungs originally evolved in the ventral part of the body,
    as in other vertebrates.\n\n\n=== Invertebrates ===\n\n\nSome invertebrates have
    lung-like structures that serve a similar respiratory purpose as, but are not
    evolutionarily related to, vertebrate lungs. \n\nSome arachnids, such as spiders
    and scorpions, have structures called book lungs used for atmospheric gas exchange.
    \n\nSome species of spider have four pairs of book lungs but most have two pairs.
    \n\nScorpions have spiracles on their body for the entrance of air to the book
    lungs.The coconut crab is terrestrial and uses structures called branchiostegal
    lungs to breathe air. \n\nThey cannot swim and would drown in water, yet they
    possess a rudimentary set of gills. \n\nThey can breathe on land and hold their
    breath underwater. \n\nThe branchiostegal lungs are seen as a developmental adaptive
    stage from water-living to enable land-living, or from fish to amphibian.Pulmonates
    are mostly land snails and slugs that have developed a simple lung from the mantle
    cavity. \n\nAn externally located opening called the pneumostome allows air to
    be taken into the mantle cavity lung.\n\n\n== Evolutionary origins ==\n\nThe
    lungs of today's terrestrial vertebrates and the gas bladders of today's fish
    are believed to have evolved from simple sacs, as outpocketings of the esophagus,
    that allowed early fish to gulp air under oxygen-poor conditions. \n\nThese outpocketings
    first arose in the bony fish. \n\nIn most of the ray-finned fish the sacs evolved
    into closed off gas bladders, while a number of carp, trout, herring, catfish,
    and eels have retained the physostome condition with the sac being open to the
    esophagus. \n\nIn more basal bony fish, such as the gar, bichir, bowfin and the
    lobe-finned fish, the bladders have evolved to primarily function as lungs. \n\nThe
    lobe-finned fish gave rise to the land-based tetrapods. \n\nThus, the lungs of
    vertebrates are homologous to the gas bladders of fish (but not to their gills).\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung"

  descriptionText: "\n\nRENAL PELVIS\n\n\nThe renal pelvis or pelvis of the kidney
    is the funnel-like dilated part of the ureter in the kidney. \n\nIn humans, the
    renal pelvis is the point where the two or three major calyces join. \n\nIt has
    a mucous membrane and is covered with transitional epithelium and an underlying
    lamina propria of loose-to-dense connective tissue.\nThe renal pelvis functions
    as a funnel for urine flowing to the ureter.\nThe renal pelvis is the location
    of several kinds of kidney cancer and is affected by infection in pyelonephritis.\n\n\n==
    Clinical significance ==\n\nThe renal pelvis is the location of several kinds
    of kidney cancer and is affected by infection in pyelonephritis. \n\nA large
    \"staghorn\" kidney stone may block all or part of the renal pelvis.\nThe size
    of the renal pelvis plays a major role in the grading of hydronephrosis. \n\nNormally,
    the anteroposterior diameter of the renal pelvis is less than 4 mm in fetuses
    up to 32 weeks of gestational age and 7 mm afterwards. \n\nIn adults, 13% of
    the normal population have a transverse pelvic diameter of over 10 mm.\n\n\n==
    Etymology and pronunciation ==\n\nLike the bony pelvis, the renal pelvis () gets
    its English name via New Latin from the older Latin word pelvis, \"basin\", as
    in \"wash basin\". \n\nIn both cases the name reflects the shape of the structure,
    and in the case of the renal pelvis, it also reflects the function. \n\nThe name
    reflects that each renal pelvis collects urine from the calyces and funnels it
    into the ureter like a wash basin collects water and funnels it into a drain
    pipe. \n\nThe renal pelvis is occasionally called the pyelum (from Greek \u03C0\u03CD\u03B5\u03BB\u03BF\u03C2
    p\xFDelos, \"trough\", \u2018anything hollow\u2019), and the combining form pyelo-
    denotes the renal pelvis (pyelo- is not to be confused with pyo-). \n\nThe words
    infundibulum and choana are other words for funnel-shaped cavities (which medical
    English got from the Latin and Greek words for \"funnel\", respectively), and
    the renal pelvis is sometimes called the renal infundibulum. \n\nThe form *renal
    choana is logical but is not used.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_pelvis"

  descriptionText: "\n\nPINEAL GLAND\n\n\nThe pineal gland, conarium, or epiphysis
    cerebri, is a small endocrine gland in the brain of most vertebrates. \n\nThe
    pineal gland produces melatonin, a serotonin-derived hormone which modulates
    sleep patterns in both circadian and seasonal cycles. \n\nThe shape of the gland
    resembles a pine cone, which gives it its name. \n\nThe pineal gland is located
    in the epithalamus, near the center of the brain, between the two hemispheres,
    tucked in a groove where the two halves of the thalamus join. \n\nThe pineal
    gland is one of the neuroendocrine secretory circumventricular organs in which
    capillaries are mostly permeable to solutes in the blood.Nearly all vertebrate
    species possess a pineal gland. \n\nThe most important exception is a primitive
    vertebrate, the hagfish. \n\nEven in the hagfish, however, there may be a \"pineal
    equivalent\" structure in the dorsal diencephalon. \n\nThe lancelet Branchiostoma
    lanceolatum, the nearest existing relative to vertebrates, also lacks a recognizable
    pineal gland. \n\nThe lamprey (another primitive vertebrate), however, does possess
    one. \n\nA few more complex vertebrates have lost pineal glands over the course
    of their evolution.The results of various scientific research in evolutionary
    biology, comparative neuroanatomy and neurophysiology have explained the evolutionary
    history (phylogeny) of the pineal gland in different vertebrate species. \n\nFrom
    the point of view of biological evolution, the pineal gland is a kind of atrophied
    photoreceptor. \n\nIn the epithalamus of some species of amphibians and reptiles,
    it is linked to a light-sensing organ, known as the parietal eye, which is also
    called the pineal eye or third eye.Ren\xE9 Descartes believed the human pineal
    gland to be the \"principal seat of the soul.\" Academic philosophy among his
    contemporaries considered the pineal gland as a neuroanatomical structure without
    special metaphysical qualities; science studied it as one endocrine gland among
    many.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe word pineal, from Latin pinea (pine-cone),
    was first used in the late 17th century to refer to the cone shape of the brain
    gland.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe pineal gland is a midline brain structure
    that is unpaired. \n\nIt takes its name from its pine-cone shape. \n\nThe gland
    is reddish-gray and about the size of a grain of rice (5\u20138 mm) in humans.
    \n\nThe pineal gland, also called the pineal body, is part of the epithalamus,
    and lies between the laterally positioned thalamic bodies and behind the habenular
    commissure. \n\nIt is located in the quadrigeminal cistern near to the corpora
    quadrigemina. \n\nIt is also located behind the third ventricle and is bathed
    in cerebrospinal fluid supplied through a small pineal recess of the third ventricle
    which projects into the stalk of the gland.\n\n\n=== Blood supply ===\n\nUnlike
    most of the mammalian brain, the pineal gland is not isolated from the body by
    the blood\u2013brain barrier system; it has profuse blood flow, second only to
    the kidney, supplied from the choroidal branches of the posterior cerebral artery.\n\n\n===
    Nerve supply ===\n\nThe pineal gland receives a sympathetic innervation from
    the superior cervical ganglion. \n\nA parasympathetic innervation from the pterygopalatine
    and otic ganglia is also present. \n\nFurther, some nerve fibers penetrate into
    the pineal gland via the pineal stalk (central innervation). \n\nAlso, neurons
    in the trigeminal ganglion innervate the gland with nerve fibers containing the
    neuropeptide PACAP.\n\n\n=== Microanatomy ===\n\n\nThe pineal body in humans
    consists of a lobular parenchyma of pinealocytes surrounded by connective tissue
    spaces. \n\nThe gland's surface is covered by a pial capsule.\nThe pineal gland
    consists mainly of pinealocytes, but four other cell types have been identified.
    \n\nAs it is quite cellular (in relation to the cortex and white matter), it
    may be mistaken for a neoplasm.\n\n\n=== Development ===\n\nThe human pineal
    gland grows in size until about 1\u20132 years of age, remaining stable thereafter,
    although its weight increases gradually from puberty onwards. \n\nThe abundant
    melatonin levels in children are believed to inhibit sexual development, and
    pineal tumors have been linked with precocious puberty. \n\nWhen puberty arrives,
    melatonin production is reduced.\n\n\n=== Symmetry ===\n\nIn the zebrafish the
    pineal gland does not straddle the midline, but shows a left-sided bias. \n\nIn
    humans, functional cerebral dominance is accompanied by subtle anatomical asymmetry.\n\n\n==
    Function ==\n\nOne function of the pineal gland is to produce melatonin. \n\nMelatonin
    has various functions in the central nervous system, the most important of which
    is to help modulate sleep patterns. \n\nMelatonin production is stimulated by
    darkness and inhibited by light. \n\nLight sensitive nerve cells in the retina
    detect light and send this signal to the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), synchronizing
    the SCN to the day-night cycle. \n\nNerve fibers then relay the daylight information
    from the SCN to the paraventricular nuclei (PVN), then to the spinal cord and
    via the sympathetic system to superior cervical ganglia (SCG), and from there
    into the pineal gland.\nThe compound pinoline is also claimed to be produced
    in the pineal gland; it is one of the beta-carbolines. \n\nThis claim is subject
    to some controversy.\n\n\n=== Regulation of the pituitary gland ===\n\nStudies
    on rodents suggest that the pineal gland influences the pituitary gland's secretion
    of the sex hormones, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinizing hormone
    (LH). \n\nPinealectomy performed on rodents produced no change in pituitary weight,
    but caused an increase in the concentration of FSH and LH within the gland. \n\nAdministration
    of melatonin did not return the concentrations of FSH to normal levels, suggesting
    that the pineal gland influences pituitary gland secretion of FSH and LH through
    an undescribed transmitting molecule.The pineal gland contains receptors for
    the regulatory neuropeptide, endothelin-1, which, when injected in picomolar
    quantities into the lateral cerebral ventricle, causes a calcium-mediated increase
    in pineal glucose metabolism.\n\n\n=== Regulation of bone metabolism ===\n\nStudies
    in mice suggest that the pineal-derived melatonin regulates new bone deposition.
    \n\nPineal-derived melatonin mediates its action on the bone cells through MT2
    receptors. \n\nThis pathway could be a potential new target for osteoporosis
    treatment as the study shows the curative effect of oral melatonin treatment
    in a postmenopausal osteoporosis mouse model.\n\n\n== Clinical significance ==\n\n\n\n===
    Calcification ===\n\nCalcification of the pineal gland is typical in young adults,
    and has been observed in children as young as two years of age. \n\nThe internal
    secretions of the pineal gland are known to inhibit the development of the reproductive
    glands because when it is severely damaged in children, development of the sexual
    organs and the skeleton are accelerated. \n\nPineal gland calcification is detrimental
    to its ability to synthesize melatonin and scientific literature presents inconclusive
    findings on whether it causes sleep problems.The calcified gland is often seen
    in skull x-rays. \n\nCalcification rates vary widely by country and correlate
    with an increase in age, with calcification occurring in an estimated 40% of
    Americans by age seventeen. \n\nCalcification of the pineal gland is associated
    with corpora arenacea, also known as \"brain sand\".\n\n\n=== Tumors ===\n\nTumors
    of the pineal gland are called pinealomas. \n\nThese tumors are rare and 50%
    to 70% are germinomas that arise from sequestered embryonic germ cells. \n\nHistologically
    they are similar to testicular seminomas and ovarian dysgerminomas.A pineal tumor
    can compress the superior colliculi and pretectal area of the dorsal midbrain,
    producing Parinaud's syndrome. \n\nPineal tumors also can cause compression of
    the cerebral aqueduct, resulting in a noncommunicating hydrocephalus. \n\nOther
    manifestations are the consequence of their pressure effects and consist of visual
    disturbances, headache, mental deterioration, and sometimes dementia-like behaviour.These
    neoplasms are divided into three categories: pineoblastomas, pineocytomas, and
    mixed tumors, based on their level of differentiation, which, in turn, correlates
    with their neoplastic aggressiveness. \n\nThe clinical course of patients with
    pineocytomas is prolonged, averaging up to several years. \n\nThe position of
    these tumors makes them difficult to remove surgically.\n\n\n=== Other conditions
    ===\n\nThe morphology of the pineal gland differs markedly in different pathological
    conditions. \n\nFor instance, it is known that its volume is reduced both in
    obese patients as well as patients with primary insomnia.\n\n\n== Other animals
    ==\n\nMost living vertebrates have pineal glands. \n\nIt is likely that the common
    ancestor of all vertebrates had a pair of photosensory organs on the top of its
    head, similar to the arrangement in modern lampreys. \n\nSome extinct Devonian
    fishes have two parietal foramina in their skulls, suggesting an ancestral bilaterality
    of parietal eyes. \n\nThe parietal eye and the pineal gland of living tetrapods
    are probably the descendants of the left and right parts of this organ, respectively.During
    embryonic development, the parietal eye and the pineal organ of modern lizards
    and tuataras form together from a pocket formed in the brain ectoderm. \n\nThe
    loss of parietal eyes in many living tetrapods is supported by developmental
    formation of a paired structure that subsequently fuses into a single pineal
    gland in developing embryos of turtles, snakes, birds, and mammals.The pineal
    organs of mammals fall into one of three categories based on shape. \n\nRodents
    have more structurally complex pineal glands than other mammals.Crocodilians
    and some tropical lineages of mammals (some xenarthrans (sloths), pangolins,
    sirenians (manatees and dugongs), and some marsupials (sugar gliders)) have lost
    both their parietal eye and their pineal organ. \n\nPolar mammals, such as walruses
    and some seals, possess unusually large pineal glands.All amphibians have a pineal
    organ, but some frogs and toads also have what is called a \"frontal organ\",
    which is essentially a parietal eye.Pinealocytes in many non-mammalian vertebrates
    have a strong resemblance to the photoreceptor cells of the eye. \n\nEvidence
    from morphology and developmental biology suggests that pineal cells possess
    a common evolutionary ancestor with retinal cells.Pineal cytostructure seems
    to have evolutionary similarities to the retinal cells of the lateral eyes. \n\nModern
    birds and reptiles express the phototransducing pigment melanopsin in the pineal
    gland. \n\nAvian pineal glands are thought to act like the suprachiasmatic nucleus
    in mammals. \n\nThe structure of the pineal eye in modern lizards and tuatara
    is analogous to the cornea, lens, and retina of the lateral eyes of vertebrates.In
    most vertebrates, exposure to light sets off a chain reaction of enzymatic events
    within the pineal gland that regulates circadian rhythms. \n\nIn humans and other
    mammals, the light signals necessary to set circadian rhythms are sent from the
    eye through the retinohypothalamic system to the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN)
    and the pineal gland.\nThe fossilized skulls of many extinct vertebrates have
    a pineal foramen (opening), which in some cases is larger than that of any living
    vertebrate. \n\nAlthough fossils seldom preserve deep-brain soft anatomy, the
    brain of the Russian fossil bird Cerebavis cenomanica from Melovatka, about 90
    million years old, shows a relatively large parietal eye and pineal gland.Rick
    Strassman, an author and Clinical Associate Professor of Psychiatry at the University
    of New Mexico School of Medicine, has theorised that the human pineal gland is
    capable of producing the hallucinogen N,N-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT) under certain
    circumstances. \n\nIn 2013 he and other researchers first reported DMT in the
    pineal gland microdialysate of rodents.\n\n\n== Society and culture ==\n\n\nSeventeenth-century
    philosopher and scientist Ren\xE9 Descartes was highly interested in anatomy
    and physiology. \n\nHe discussed the pineal gland both in his first book, the
    Treatise of Man (written before 1637, but only published posthumously 1662/1664),
    and in his last book, The Passions of the Soul (1649) and he regarded it as \"the
    principal seat of the soul and the place in which all our thoughts are formed.\"
    In the Treatise of Man, Descartes described conceptual models of man, namely
    creatures created by God, which consist of two ingredients, a body and a soul.
    \n\nIn the Passions, Descartes split man up into a body and a soul and emphasized
    that the soul is joined to the whole body by \"a certain very small gland situated
    in the middle of the brain's substance and suspended above the passage through
    which the spirits in the brain's anterior cavities communicate with those in
    its posterior cavities\". \n\nDescartes attached significance to the gland because
    he believed it to be the only section of the brain to exist as a single part
    rather than one-half of a pair. \n\nSome of Descartes's basic anatomical and
    physiological assumptions were totally mistaken, not only by modern standards,
    but also in light of what was already known in his time.The notion of a \"pineal-eye\"
    is central to the philosophy of the French writer Georges Bataille, which is
    analyzed at length by literary scholar Denis Hollier in his study Against Architecture.
    \n\nIn this work Hollier discusses how Bataille uses the concept of a \"pineal-eye\"
    as a reference to a blind-spot in Western rationality, and an organ of excess
    and delirium. \n\nThis conceptual device is explicit in his surrealist texts,
    The Jesuve and The Pineal Eye.In the late 19th century Madame Blavatsky (who
    founded theosophy) identified the pineal gland with the Hindu concept of the
    third eye, or the Ajna chakra. \n\nThis association is still popular today.In
    the short story \"From Beyond\" by H. \n\nP. \n\nLovecraft, a scientist creates
    an electronic device that emits a resonance wave, which stimulates an affected
    person's pineal gland, thereby allowing them to perceive planes of existence
    outside the scope of accepted reality, a translucent, alien environment that
    overlaps our own recognized reality. \n\nIt was adapted as a film of the same
    name in 1986. \n\nThe 2013 horror film Banshee Chapter is heavily influenced
    by this short story.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe secretory activity of the pineal
    gland is only partially understood. \n\nIts location deep in the brain suggested
    to philosophers throughout history that it possesses particular importance. \n\nThis
    combination led to its being regarded as a \"mystery\" gland with mystical, metaphysical,
    and occult theories surrounding its perceived functions.\nThe pineal gland was
    originally believed to be a \"vestigial remnant\" of a larger organ. \n\nIn 1917,
    it was known that extract of cow pineals lightened frog skin. \n\nDermatology
    professor Aaron B. \n\nLerner and colleagues at Yale University, hoping that
    a substance from the pineal might be useful in treating skin diseases, isolated
    and named the hormone melatonin in 1958. \n\nThe substance did not prove to be
    helpful as intended, but its discovery helped solve several mysteries such as
    why removing the rat's pineal accelerated ovary growth, why keeping rats in constant
    light decreased the weight of their pineals, and why pinealectomy and constant
    light affect ovary growth to an equal extent; this knowledge gave a boost to
    the then new field of chronobiology.Of the endocrine organs, the function of
    the pineal gland was the last discovered.\nLocated deep in the center of the
    brain, the pineal gland was once known as the \u201Cthird eye.\u201D\nThe pineal
    gland produces melatonin, which helps maintain circadian rhythm and regulate
    reproductive hormones.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pineal_gland"
