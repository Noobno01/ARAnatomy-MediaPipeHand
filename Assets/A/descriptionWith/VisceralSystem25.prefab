  descriptionText: "\n\nTAENIA COLI\n\n\nThe taeniae coli (also teniae coli or tenia
    coli) are three separate longitudinal ribbons (taeniae meaning ribbon in Latin)
    of smooth muscle on the outside of the ascending, transverse, descending and
    sigmoid colons. \n\nThey are visible and can be seen just below the serosa or
    fibrosa. \n\nThere are three teniae coli: mesocolic, free and omental taeniae
    coli. \n\nThe teniae coli contract lengthwise to produce the haustra, the bulges
    in the colon.\nThe bands converge at the root of the vermiform appendix. \n\nAt
    the rectosigmoid junction, the taeniae spread out and unite to form the longitudinal
    muscle layer. \n\nIn the caecum, the ascending colon, the descending colon and
    sigmoid colon the positions of these bands are fixed. \n\nThe taenia libera,
    is placed anteriorly in the caecum, ascending, descending and sigmoid colon,
    but is placed inferiorly in the transverse colon. \n\nThe taenia mesocolica is
    present on the posteromedial surface of caecum, ascending, descending and sigmoid
    colon, but is placed posteriorly on transverse colon at the site of attachment
    of transverse mesocolon. \n\nThe taenia omentalis is situated posterolaterally
    in caecum, ascending, descending and sigmoid colon, but is situated on the anterosuperior
    surface of transverse colon where layers three and four of the greater omentum
    meet the transverse colon. \n\nThis change in position is due to the twist in
    transverse colon. \n\nThese bands correspond to the outer layer of the muscularis
    externa, in other portions of the digestive tract.\n\nThe teniae coli are regulated
    by the sacral nerves of the spinal cord, which are under control of the parasympathetic
    nervous system.\n\n\n== Diverticulosis ==\n\n\nSpaces between the circular bands
    of taeniae are weak points in the bowel, and are the sites of diverticulosis.
    \n\nMost diverticulosis occur in the sigmoid colon as it is the segment with
    the highest intraluminal pressure. \n\nDiverticulosis does not occur in the rectum
    as the tenia coli become a continuous muscular layer. \n\nDiverticulosis can
    then become diverticulitis if the patient develops inflammation of the diverticulosis,
    this whole spectrum of disease is called diverticular disease.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taenia_coli"

  descriptionText: "\n\nSOFT PALATE\n\n\nThe soft palate (also known as the velum,
    palatal velum, or muscular palate) is, in mammals, the soft tissue constituting
    the back of the roof of the mouth. \n\nThe soft palate is part of the palate
    of the mouth; the other part is the hard palate. \n\nThe soft palate is distinguished
    from the hard palate at the front of the mouth in that it does not contain bone.\n\n\n==
    Structure ==\n\n\n\n=== Muscles ===\n\n\nThe five muscles of the soft palate
    play important roles in swallowing and breathing. \n\nThe muscles are: \n\nTensor
    veli palatini, which is involved in swallowing\nPalatoglossus, involved in swallowing\nPalatopharyngeus,
    involved in breathing\nLevator veli palatini, involved in swallowing\nMusculus
    uvulae, which moves the uvulaThese muscles are innervated by the pharyngeal plexus
    via the vagus nerve, with the exception of the tensor veli palatini. \n\nThe
    tensor veli palatini is innervated by the mandibular division of the trigeminal
    nerve (V3).\n\n\n== Function ==\n\nThe soft palate is moveable, consisting of
    muscle fibers sheathed in mucous membrane. \n\nIt is responsible for closing
    off the nasal passages during the act of swallowing, and also for closing off
    the airway. \n\nDuring sneezing, it protects the nasal passage by diverting a
    portion of the excreted substance to the mouth.\nIn humans, the uvula hangs from
    the end of the soft palate. \n\nTouching the uvula or the end of the soft palate
    evokes a strong gag reflex in most people.\n\n\n=== Speech ===\n\nA speech sound
    made with the middle part of the tongue (dorsum) touching the soft palate is
    known as a velar consonant.\nIt is possible for the soft palate to retract and
    elevate during speech to separate the oral cavity (mouth) from the nasal cavity
    in order to produce the oral speech sounds. \n\nIf this separation is incomplete,
    air escapes through the nose, causing speech to be perceived as nasal.\n\n\n===
    Modelling ===\n\nWithin the microstructure of the soft palate lie a variety of
    variably-oriented fibers that create a nonuniform surface with a nonuniform density
    distribution. \n\nThe tissue has been characterized as viscoelastic, nonlinear,
    and anisotropic in the direction of the fibers. \n\nYoung modulus values range
    from 585 Pa at the posterior free edge of the soft palate to 1409 Pa where the
    soft palate attaches to the maxilla. \n\nThese properties are useful when quantifying
    the effects of corrective orthopedic devices such as the Hotz Plate on cleft
    lip.\nQuantitative analyses have been done on bilateral and unilateral cleft
    palate to better understand geometric differences in cleft palate throughout
    the course of its development and correction. \n\nDespite the difficulty in finding
    common, comparable landmarks between normal soft palates and cleft palates, analytical
    methods have been devised to assess differences in degree of curvature of the
    alveolar crest, two-dimensional and three-dimensional surface area, and slope
    of the alveolar crest.\nFinite element analysis has demonstrated effective modeling
    of soft-palate extension and movement. \n\nIt has also been an effective tool
    for evaluating the craniofacial effects of corrective orthopedic devices and
    cleft lip.\n\n\n== Clinical significance ==\n\n\n\n=== Disease ===\n\n\nPathology
    of the soft palate includes mucosal lesions such as pemphigus vulgaris dsg -
    3, herpangina and migratory stomatitis, and muscular conditions such as the congenital
    cleft palate and cleft uvula.\n\nPetechiae on the soft palate are mainly associated
    with streptococcal pharyngitis, and as such it is an uncommon but highly specific
    finding. 10 to 30 percent of palatal petechiae cases are estimated to be caused
    by suction, which can be habitual or secondary to fellatio.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_palate"

  descriptionText: "\n\nURETHRA\n\n\nThe urethra (from Greek \u03BF\u1F50\u03C1\u03AE\u03B8\u03C1\u03B1
    \u2013 our\u1E17thr\u0101) is a tube that connects the urinary bladder to the
    urinary meatus for the removal of urine from the body of both females and males.
    \n\nIn human females and other primates, the urethra connects to the urinary
    meatus above the vagina, whereas in marsupials, the female's urethra empties
    into the urogenital sinus.Females use their urethra only for urinating, but males
    use their urethra for both urination and ejaculation. \n\nThe external urethral
    sphincter is a striated muscle that allows voluntary control over urination.
    \n\nThe internal sphincter, formed by the involuntary smooth muscles lining the
    bladder neck and urethra, receives its nerve supply by the sympathetic division
    of the autonomic nervous system. \n\nThe internal sphincter is present both in
    males and females.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe urethra is a fibrous and muscular
    tube which connects the urinary bladder to the external urethral meatus. \n\nIts
    length differs between the sexes, because it passes through the penis in males.\n\n\n===
    Male ===\n\n\nIn the human male, the urethra is on average 18 to 20 centimetres
    (7.1 to 7.9 in) long and opens at the end of the external urethral meatus.The
    urethra is divided into four parts in men, named after the location:\nThere is
    inadequate data for the typical length of the male urethra; however, a study
    of 109 men showed an average length of 22.3 cm (SD = 2.4 cm), ranging from 15
    cm to 29 cm.\n\n\n=== Female ===\n\nIn the human female, the urethra is about
    4 cm long, and exits the body between the clitoris and the vagina, extending
    from the internal to the external urethral orifice. \n\nThe meatus is located
    below the clitoris. \n\nIt is placed behind the symphysis pubis, embedded in
    the anterior wall of the vagina, and its direction is obliquely downward and
    forward; it is slightly curved with the concavity directed forward. \n\nThe proximal
    two-thirds of the urethra is lined by transitional epithelial cells, while the
    distal third is lined by stratified squamous epithelial cells.Between the superior
    and inferior fascia of the urogenital diaphragm, the female urethra is surrounded
    by the urethral sphincter.\n\n\n=== Microanatomy ===\n\nThe cells lining the
    urethra (the epithelium) start off as transitional cells as it exits the bladder,
    which are variable layers of flat to cuboidal cells that change shape depending
    on whether they are compressed by the contents of the urethra. \n\nFurther along
    the urethra there are pseudostratified columnar and stratified columnar epithelia.
    \n\nThe lining becomes multiple layers of flat cells near the end of the urethra,
    which is the same as the external skin around it.There are small mucus-secreting
    urethral glands, as well as bulbo-urethral glands of Cowper, that secret mucous
    acting to lubricate the urethra.The urethra consists of three coats: muscular,
    erectile, and mucous, the muscular layer being a continuation of that of the
    bladder.\n\n\n=== Blood and nerve supply and lymphatics ===\n\nSomatic (conscious)
    innervation of the external urethral sphincter is supplied by the pudendal nerve.\n\n\n==
    Development ==\n\n\nIn the developing embryo, at the hind end lies a cloaca.
    \n\nThis, over the fourth to the seventh week, divides into a urogenital sinus
    and the beginnings of the anal canal, with a wall forming between these two inpouchings
    called the urorectal septum. \n\nThe urogenital sinus divides into three parts,
    with the middle part forming the urethra; the upper part is largest and becomes
    the urinary bladder, and the lower part then changes depending on the biological
    sex of the embryo. \n\nThe cells lining the urethra (the epithelium) come from
    endoderm, whereas the connective tissue and smooth muscle parts are derived from
    mesoderm.After the third month, urethra also contributes to the development of
    associated structures depending on the biological sex of the embryo. \n\nIn the
    male, the epithelium multiples to form the prostate. \n\nIn the female, the upper
    part of the urethra forms the urethra and paraurethral glands.\n\n\n== Function
    ==\n\n\n\n=== Urination ===\n\n\nThe urethra is the vessel through which urine
    passes after leaving the bladder. \n\nDuring urination, the smooth muscle lining
    the urethra relaxes in concert with bladder contraction(s) to forcefully expel
    the urine in a pressurized stream. \n\nFollowing this, the urethra re-establishes
    muscle tone by contracting the smooth muscle layer, and the bladder returns to
    a relaxed, quiescent state. \n\nUrethral smooth muscle cells are mechanically
    coupled to each other to coordinate mechanical force and electrical signaling
    in an organized, unitary fashion.\n\n\n=== Ejaculation ===\n\nThe male urethra
    is the conduit for semen during sexual intercourse. \n\nUrine is removed before
    ejaculation by pre-ejaculate fluid \u2013 called Cowper's fluid \u2013 from the
    bulbourethral gland.\n\n\n== Clinical significance ==\n\n\nInfection of the urethra
    is urethritis, which often causes purulent urethral discharge. \n\nIt is most
    often due to a sexually transmitted infection such as gonorrhoea or chlamydia,
    and less commonly due to other bacteria such as ureaplasma or mycoplasma; trichomonas
    vaginalis; or the viruses herpes simplex virus and adenovirus. \n\nInvestigations
    such as a gram stain of the discharge might reveal the cause; nucleic acid testing
    based on the first urine sample passed in a day, or a swab of the urethra sent
    for bacterial culture and sensitivity may also be used. \n\nTreatment usually
    involves antibiotics that treat both gonorrhoea and chlamydia, as these often
    occur together. \n\nA person being treated for urethritis should not have sex
    until the infection is treated, so that they do not spread the infection to others.
    \n\nBecause of this spread, which may occur during an incubation period before
    a person gets symptoms, there is often contact tracing so that sexual partners
    of an affected person can be found and treatment offered.Cancer can also develop
    in the lining of the urethra. \n\nWhen cancer is present, the most common symptom
    in an affected person is blood in the urine; a physical medical examination may
    be otherwise normal, except in late disease. \n\nCancer of the urethra is most
    often due to cancer of the cells lining the urethra, called transitional cell
    carcinoma, although it can more rarely occur as a squamous cell carcinoma if
    the type of cells lining the urethra have changed, such as due to a chronic schistosomiasis
    infection. \n\nInvestigations performed usually include collecting a sample of
    urine for an inspection for malignant cells under a microscope, called cytology,
    as well as examination with a flexible camera through the urethra, called urethroscopy.
    \n\nIf a malignancy is found, a biopsy will be taken, and a CT scan will be performed
    of other body parts (a CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis) to look for
    additional metastatic lesions. \n\nAfter the cancer is staged, treatment may
    involve chemotherapy.\n\n\n=== Injury ===\n\nPassage of kidney stones through
    the urethra can be painful. \n\nDamage to the urethra, such as by kidney stones,
    chronic infection, cancer, or from catheterisation, can lead to narrowing, called
    a urethral stricture. \n\nThe location and structure of the narrowing can be
    investigated with a medical imaging scan in which dye is injected through the
    urinary meatus into the urethra, called a retrograde urethrogram. \n\nAdditional
    forms of imaging, such as ultrasound, computed tomography and magnetic resonance
    imaging may also be used to provide further details.Injuries to the urethra (e.g.,
    from a pelvic fracture)\nForeign bodies in the urethra are uncommon, but there
    have been medical case reports of self-inflicted injuries, a result of insertion
    of foreign bodies into the urethra such as an electrical wire.\n\n\n=== Other
    ===\n\nHypospadias and epispadias are forms of abnormal development of the urethra
    in the male, where the meatus is not located at the distal end of the penis (it
    occurs lower than normal with hypospadias, and higher with epispadias). \n\nIn
    a severe chordee, the urethra can develop between the penis and the scrotum.\n\n\n===
    Catheterisation ===\n\nA tube called a catheter can be inserted through the urethra
    to drain urine from the bladder, called an indwelling urinary catheter; or, to
    bypass the urethra, a catheter may be directly inserted through the abdominal
    wall into the bladder, called a suprapubic catheter. \n\nThis may be to relieve
    or bypass an obstruction, to monitor how much urine someone produces, or because
    a person has difficulty urinating, for example due to a neurological cause such
    as multiple sclerosis. \n\nComplications that are associated with catheter insertion
    can include catheter-associated infections, injury to the urethra or nearby structures,
    or pain.\n\n\n== Other animals ==\n\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe word \"urethra\"
    comes from the Ancient Greek stem \"uro\" relating to urination, with the structure
    described as early as the time of Hippocrates. \n\nConfusingly however, at the
    time it was called \"ureter\". \n\nThereafter, terms \"ureter\" and \"urethra\"
    were variably used to refer to each other thereafter for more than a millennia.
    \n\nIt was only in the 1550s that anatomists such as Bartolomeo Eustacchio and
    Jacques Dubois began to use the terms to specifically and consistently refer
    to what is in modern English called the ureter and the urethra. \n\nFollowing
    this, in the 19th and 20th centuries multiple terms relating to the structures
    such as urethritis and urethrography, were coined.Kidney stones have been identified
    and recorded about as long as written historical records exist. \n\nThe urinary
    tract as well as its function to drain urine from the kidneys, has been described
    by Galen in the second century AD. \n\nSurgery to the urethra to remove kidney
    stones has been described since at least the first century AD by Aulus Cornelius
    Celsus.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urethra"

    pancreatic duct. \n\nHowever, some have an additional accessory pancreatic duct,
    also called the Duct of Santorini. \n\nAn accessory pancreatic duct can be functional
    or non-functional.\n\nIt may open separately into the second part of the duodenum,
    which is dorsal, and usually (in 70% of people) drains into the duodenum via
    the minor duodenal papilla. \n\nIn the other 30% of people, it drains into the
    main pancreatic duct, which drains into the duodenum via the major duodenal papilla.
    \n\nThe main pancreatic duct and the accessory duct both eventually\u2014either
    directly or indirectly\u2014connect to the second part ('D2', the vertical segment)
    of the duodenum. \n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_duct"

  descriptionText: "\n\nSTOMACH\n\n\nThe stomach is a muscular, hollow organ in the
    gastrointestinal tract of humans and many other animals, including several invertebrates.
    \n\nThe stomach has a dilated structure and functions as a vital digestive organ.
    \n\nIn the digestive system the stomach is involved in the second phase of digestion,
    following chewing. \n\nIt performs a chemical breakdown by means of enzymes and
    hydrochloric acid.\nIn humans and many other animals, the stomach is located
    between the oesophagus and the small intestine. \n\nThe stomach secretes digestive
    enzymes and gastric acid to aid in food digestion. \n\nThe pyloric sphincter
    controls the passage of partially digested food (chyme) from the stomach into
    the duodenum, where peristalsis takes over to move this through the rest of intestines.\n\n\n==
    Structure ==\n\nIn humans, the stomach lies between the oesophagus and the duodenum
    (the first part of the small intestine). \n\nIt is in the left upper part of
    the abdominal cavity. \n\nThe top of the stomach lies against the diaphragm.
    \n\nLying behind the stomach is the pancreas. \n\nA large double fold of visceral
    peritoneum called the greater omentum hangs down from the greater curvature of
    the stomach. \n\nTwo sphincters keep the contents of the stomach contained; the
    lower oesophageal sphincter (found in the cardiac region), at the junction of
    the oesophagus and stomach, and the pyloric sphincter at the junction of the
    stomach with the duodenum.\n\nThe stomach is surrounded by parasympathetic (stimulant)
    and sympathetic (inhibitor) plexuses (networks of blood vessels and nerves in
    the anterior gastric, posterior, superior and inferior, celiac and myenteric),
    which regulate both the secretory activity of the stomach and the motor (motion)
    activity of its muscles.\n\nBecause it is a distensible organ, it normally expands
    to hold about one litre of food. \n\nThe stomach of a newborn human baby will
    only be able to retain about 30 millilitres. \n\nThe maximum stomach volume in
    adults is between 2 and 4 litres.\n\n\n=== Sections ===\n\n\nIn classical anatomy
    the human stomach is divided into four sections, beginning at the cardia.\n\nThe
    cardia is where the contents of the esophagus empty into the stomach.\n\nThe
    fundus (from Latin 'bottom') is formed in the upper curved part.\nThe body is
    the main, central region of the stomach.\n\nThe pylorus (from Greek 'gatekeeper')
    is the lower section of the stomach that empties contents into the duodenum.\n\nThe
    cardia is defined as the region following the \"z-line\" of the gastroesophageal
    junction, the point at which the epithelium changes from stratified squamous
    to columnar. \n\nNear the cardia is the lower oesophageal sphincter. \n\nRecent
    research has shown that the cardia is not an anatomically distinct region of
    the stomach but a region of the oesophageal lining damaged by reflux.\n\n\n===
    Anatomical proximity ===\n\nThe stomach bed refers to the structures upon which
    the stomach rests in mammals. \n\nThese include the pancreas, spleen, left kidney,
    left suprarenal gland, transverse colon and its mesocolon, and the diaphragm.
    \n\nThe term was introduced around 1896 by Philip Polson of the Catholic University
    School of Medicine, Dublin. \n\nHowever this was brought into disrepute by surgeon
    anatomist J Massey.\n\n\n=== Blood supply ===\n\n\nThe lesser curvature of the
    human stomach is supplied by the right gastric artery inferiorly and the left
    gastric artery superiorly, which also supplies the cardiac region. \n\nThe greater
    curvature is supplied by the right gastroepiploic artery inferiorly and the left
    gastroepiploic artery superiorly. \n\nThe fundus of the stomach, and also the
    upper portion of the greater curvature, is supplied by the short gastric arteries,
    which arise from the splenic artery.\n\n\n=== Microanatomy ===\n\n\n==== Wall
    ====\n\nLike the other parts of the gastrointestinal tract, the human stomach
    walls consist of a mucosa, submucosa, muscularis externa, subserosa and serosa.\n\nThe
    inner part of the lining of the stomach, the gastric mucosa, consists of an outer
    layer of column-shaped cells, a lamina propria, and a thin layer of smooth muscle
    called the muscularis mucosa. \n\nBeneath the mucosa lies the submucosa, consisting
    of fibrous connective tissue. \n\nMeissner's plexus is in this layer interior
    to the oblique muscle layer.Outside of the submucosa lies another muscular layer,
    the muscularis externa. \n\nIt consists of three layers of muscular fibres, with
    fibres lying at angles to each other. \n\nThese are the inner oblique, middle
    circular, and outer longitudinal layers. \n\nThe presence of the inner oblique
    layer is distinct from other parts of the gastrointestinal tract, which do not
    possess this layer. \n\nStomach contains the thickest muscularis layer consisting
    of three layers, thus maximum peristalsis occurs here.\n\nThe inner oblique layer:
    This layer is responsible for creating the motion that churns and physically
    breaks down the food. \n\nIt is the only layer of the three which is not seen
    in other parts of the digestive system. \n\nThe antrum has thicker skin cells
    in its walls and performs more forceful contractions than the fundus.\n\nThe
    middle circular layer: At this layer, the pylorus is surrounded by a thick circular
    muscular wall, which is normally tonically constricted, forming a functional
    (if not anatomically discrete) pyloric sphincter, which controls the movement
    of chyme into the duodenum. \n\nThis layer is concentric to the longitudinal
    axis of the stomach.\n\nAuerbach's plexus (myenteric plexus) is found between
    the outer longitudinal and the middle circular layer and is responsible for the
    innervation of both (causing peristalsis and mixing).\n\nThe outer longitudinal
    layer is responsible for moving the bolus towards the pylorus of the stomach
    through muscular shortening.\n\nTo the outside of the muscularis externa lies
    a serosa, consisting of layers of connective tissue continuous with the peritoneum.\n\n\n====
    Glands ====\n\nThe mucosa lining the stomach is lined with a number of these
    pits, which receive gastric juice, secreted by between 2 and 7 gastric glands.
    \n\nGastric juice is an acidic fluid containing hydrochloric acid and the digestive
    enzyme pepsin. \n\nThe glands contains a number of cells, with the function of
    the glands changing depending on their position within the stomach.\n\nWithin
    the body and fundus of the stomach lie the fundic glands. \n\nIn general, these
    glands are lined by column-shaped cells that secrete a protective layer of mucus
    and bicarbonate. \n\nAdditional cells present include parietal cells that secrete
    hydrochloric acid and intrinsic factor, chief cells that secrete pepsinogen (this
    is a precursor to pepsin- the highly acidic environment converts the pepsinogen
    to pepsin), and neuroendocrine cells that secrete serotonin.Glands differ where
    the stomach meets the esophagus and near the pylorus. \n\nNear the junction between
    the stomach and the oesophagus lie cardiac glands, which primarily secrete mucus.
    \n\nThey are fewer in number than the other gastric glands and are more shallowly
    positioned in the mucosa. \n\nThere are two kinds - either simple tubular with
    short ducts or compound racemose resembling the duodenal Brunner's glands. \n\nNear
    the pylorus lie pyloric glands located in the antrum of the pylorus. \n\nThey
    secrete mucus, as well as gastrin produced by their G cells.\n\n\n=== Gene and
    protein expression ===\n\n\nAbout 20,000 protein coding genes are expressed in
    human cells and nearly 70% of these genes are expressed in the normal stomach.
    \n\nJust over 150 of these genes are more specifically expressed in the stomach
    compared to other organs, with only some 20 genes being highly specific. \n\nThe
    corresponding specific proteins expressed in stomach are mainly involved in creating
    a suitable environment for handling the digestion of food for uptake of nutrients.
    \n\nHighly stomach-specific proteins include GKN1, expressed in the mucosa; pepsinogen
    PGC and the lipase LIPF, expressed in chief cells; and gastric ATPase ATP4A and
    gastric intrinsic factor GIF, expressed in parietal cells.\n\n\n== Development
    ==\n\nIn early human embryogenesis, the ventral part of the embryo abuts the
    yolk sac. \n\nDuring the third week of development, as the embryo grows, it begins
    to surround parts of the sac. \n\nThe enveloped portions form the basis for the
    adult gastrointestinal tract. \n\nThe sac is surrounded by a network of vitelline
    arteries and veins. \n\nOver time, these arteries consolidate into the three
    main arteries that supply the developing gastrointestinal tract: the celiac artery,
    superior mesenteric artery, and inferior mesenteric artery. \n\nThe areas supplied
    by these arteries are used to define the foregut, midgut, and hindgut. \n\nThe
    surrounded sac becomes the primitive gut. \n\nSections of this gut begin to differentiate
    into the organs of the gastrointestinal tract, and the esophagus, and stomach
    form from the foregut.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\n=== Digestion ===\n\n\nIn the human
    digestive system, a bolus (a small rounded mass of chewed up food) enters the
    stomach through the esophagus via the lower esophageal sphincter. \n\nThe stomach
    releases proteases (protein-digesting enzymes such as pepsin) and hydrochloric
    acid, which kills or inhibits bacteria and provides the acidic pH of 2 for the
    proteases to work. \n\nFood is churned by the stomach through muscular contractions
    of the wall called peristalsis \u2013 reducing the volume of the bolus, before
    looping around the fundus and the body of stomach as the boluses are converted
    into chyme (partially digested food). \n\nChyme slowly passes through the pyloric
    sphincter and into the duodenum of the small intestine, where the extraction
    of nutrients begins.\n\nGastric juice in the stomach also contains pepsinogen.
    \n\nHydrochloric acid activates this inactive form of enzyme into the active
    form, pepsin. \n\nPepsin breaks down proteins into polypeptides.\n\n\n=== Absorption
    ===\n\nAlthough the absorption in the human digestive system is mainly a function
    of the small intestine, some absorption of certain small molecules nevertheless
    does occur in the stomach through its lining. \n\nThis includes:\n\nWater, if
    the body is dehydrated\nMedication, such as aspirin\nAmino acids\n10\u201320%
    of ingested ethanol (e.g. from alcoholic beverages)\nCaffeine\nTo a small extent
    water-soluble vitamins (most are absorbed in the small intestine)\nThe parietal
    cells of the human stomach are responsible for producing intrinsic factor, which
    is necessary for the absorption of vitamin B12. \n\nB12 is used in cellular metabolism
    and is necessary for the production of red blood cells, and the functioning of
    the nervous system.\n\n\n=== Control of secretion and motility ===\n\nThe movement
    and the flow of chemicals into the stomach are controlled by both the autonomic
    nervous system and by the various digestive hormones of the digestive system:\n\nOther
    than gastrin, these hormones all act to turn off the stomach action. \n\nThis
    is in response to food products in the liver and gall bladder, which have not
    yet been absorbed. \n\nThe stomach needs to push food into the small intestine
    only when the intestine is not busy. \n\nWhile the intestine is full and still
    digesting food, the stomach acts as storage for food.\n\n\n=== Other ===\n\nEffects
    of EGFEpidermal growth factor (EGF) results in cellular proliferation, differentiation,
    and survival. \n\nEGF is a low-molecular-weight polypeptide first purified from
    the mouse submandibular gland, but since then found in many human tissues including
    the submandibular gland, and the parotid gland. \n\nSalivary EGF, which also
    seems to be regulated by dietary inorganic iodine, also plays an important physiological
    role in the maintenance of oro-oesophageal and gastric tissue integrity. \n\nThe
    biological effects of salivary EGF include healing of oral and gastroesophageal
    ulcers, inhibition of gastric acid secretion, stimulation of DNA synthesis, and
    mucosal protection from intraluminal injurious factors such as gastric acid,
    bile acids, pepsin, and trypsin and from physical, chemical, and bacterial agents.\n\nStomach
    as nutrition sensorThe human stomach can \"taste\" sodium glutamate using glutamate
    receptors and this information is passed to the lateral hypothalamus and limbic
    system in the brain as a palatability signal through the vagus nerve. \n\nThe
    stomach can also sense, independently of tongue and oral taste receptors, glucose,
    carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. \n\nThis allows the brain to link nutritional
    value of foods to their tastes.\nThyrogastric syndromeThis syndrome defines the
    association between thyroid disease and chronic gastritis, which was first described
    in the 1960s. \n\nThis term was coined also to indicate the presence of thyroid
    autoantibodies or autoimmune thyroid disease in patients with pernicious anemia,
    a late clinical stage of atrophic gastritis. \n\nIn 1993, has been published
    a more complete investigation on the stomach and thyroid, reporting that the
    thyroid is, embryogenetically and phylogenetically, derived from primitive stomach,
    and that the thyroid cells, such as primitive gastroenteric cells, during vertebrate
    evolution, migrated and specialized in uptake of iodide and in storage and elaboration
    of iodine compounds. \n\nIn fact, stomach and thyroid share iodine-concentranting
    ability and many morphological and functional similarities, such as cell polarity
    and apical microvilli, similar organ-specific antigens and associated autoimmune
    diseases, secretion of glycoproteins (thyroglobulin and mucin) and peptide hormones,
    the digesting and readsorbing ability, and lastly, similar ability to form iodotyrosines
    by peroxidase activity, where iodide acts as an electron donor in the presence
    of H2O2. \n\nIn the following years, many researchers published reviews about
    this syndrome.\n\n\n== Clinical significance ==\n\n\n=== Diseases ===\n\n\nA
    series of radiographs can be used to examine the stomach for various disorders.
    \n\nThis will often include the use of a barium swallow. \n\nAnother method of
    examination of the stomach, is the use of an endoscope. \n\nA gastric emptying
    scan is considered the gold standard to assess gastric emptying rate.A large
    number of studies have indicated that most cases of peptic ulcers, and gastritis,
    in humans are caused by Helicobacter pylori infection, and an association has
    been seen with the development of stomach cancer.A stomach rumble is actually
    noise from the intestines.\n\n\n=== Surgery ===\n\nIn humans, many bariatric
    surgery procedures involve the stomach, in order to lose weight. \n\nA gastric
    band may be placed around the cardia area, which can adjust to limit intake.
    \n\nThe anatomy of the stomach may be modified, or the stomach may be bypassed
    entirely.\n\nSurgical removal of the stomach is called a gastrectomy, and removal
    of the cardia area is a called a cardiectomy. \"Cardiectomy\" is a term that
    is also used to describe the removal of the heart. \n\nA gastrectomy may be carried
    out because of gastric cancer or severe perforation of the stomach wall.\n\nFundoplication
    is stomach surgery in which the fundus is wrapped around the lower esophagus
    and stitched into place. \n\nIt is used to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease
    (GERD).\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThere were previously conflicting statements in
    the academic anatomy community over whether the cardia is part of the stomach,
    part of the oesophagus or a distinct entity. \n\nModern surgical and medical
    textbooks have agreed that \"the gastric cardia is now clearly considered to
    be part of the stomach.\"\n\n\n=== Etymology ===\n\nThe word stomach is derived
    from the Latin stomachus which has roots from the Greek word stomachos (\u03C3\u03C4\u03CC\u03BC\u03B1\u03C7\u03BF\u03C2),
    ultimately from stoma (\u03C3\u03C4\u03CC\u03BC\u03B1), \"mouth\". \n\nGastro-
    and gastric (meaning \"related to the stomach\") are both derived from the Greek
    word gaster (\u03B3\u03B1\u03C3\u03C4\u03AE\u03C1, meaning \"belly\").\n\n\n==
    Other animals ==\n\nAlthough the precise shape and size of the stomach varies
    widely among different vertebrates, the relative positions of the oesophageal
    and duodenal openings remain relatively constant. \n\nAs a result, the organ
    always curves somewhat to the left before curving back to meet the pyloric sphincter.
    \n\nHowever, lampreys, hagfishes, chimaeras, lungfishes, and some teleost fish
    have no stomach at all, with the oesophagus opening directly into the intestine.
    \n\nThese animals all consume diets that require little storage of food, no predigestion
    with gastric juices, or both.The gastric lining is usually divided into two regions,
    an anterior portion lined by fundic glands and a posterior portion lined with
    pyloric glands. \n\nCardiac glands are unique to mammals, and even then are absent
    in a number of species. \n\nThe distributions of these glands vary between species,
    and do not always correspond with the same regions as in humans. \n\nFurthermore,
    in many non-human mammals, a portion of the stomach anterior to the cardiac glands
    is lined with epithelium essentially identical to that of the oesophagus. \n\nRuminants,
    in particular, have a complex stomach, the first three chambers of which are
    all lined with oesophageal mucosa.\n\nIn birds and crocodilians, the stomach
    is divided into two regions. \n\nAnteriorly is a narrow tubular region, the proventriculus,
    lined by fundic glands, and connecting the true stomach to the crop. \n\nBeyond
    lies the powerful muscular gizzard, lined by pyloric glands, and, in some species,
    containing stones that the animal swallows to help grind up food.In insects there
    is also a crop. \n\nThe insect stomach is called the midgut.\nInformation about
    the stomach in echinoderms or molluscs can be found under the respective articles.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"

  descriptionText: "\n\nTRACHEA\n\n\nThe trachea, also known as the windpipe, is
    a cartilaginous tube that connects the larynx to the bronchi of the lungs, allowing
    the passage of air, and so is present in almost all air-breathing animals with
    lungs. \n\nThe trachea extends from the larynx and branches into the two primary
    bronchi. \n\nAt the top of the trachea the cricoid cartilage attaches it to the
    larynx. \n\nThe trachea is formed by a number of horseshoe-shaped rings, joined
    together vertically by overlying ligaments, and by the trachealis muscle at their
    ends. \n\nThe epiglottis closes the opening to the larynx during swallowing.\nThe
    trachea begins to form in the second month of embryo development, becoming longer
    and more fixed in its position over time. \n\nIt is epithelium lined with column-shaped
    cells that have hair-like extensions called cilia, with scattered goblet cells
    that produce protective mucins. \n\nThe trachea can be affected by inflammation
    or infection, usually as a result of a viral illness affecting other parts of
    the respiratory tract, such as the larynx and bronchi, called croup, that can
    result in a barking cough. \n\nInfection with bacteria usually affects the trachea
    only and can cause narrowing or even obstruction. \n\nAs a major part of the
    respiratory tract, when obstructed the trachea prevents air entering the lungs
    and so a tracheostomy may be required if the trachea is obstructed. \n\nAdditionally,
    during surgery if mechanical ventilation is required when a person is sedated,
    a tube is inserted into the trachea, called intubation.\n\nThe word trachea is
    used to define a very different organ in invertebrates than in vertebrates. \n\nInsects
    have an open respiratory system made up of spiracles, tracheae, and tracheoles
    to transport metabolic gases to and from tissues.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\n\nAn
    adult's trachea has an inner diameter of about 1.5 to 2 centimetres (0.59 to
    0.79 in) and a length of about 10 to 11 centimetres (3.9 to 4.3 in); wider in
    males than females. \n\nIt begins at the bottom of the larynx and ends at the
    carina, the point where the trachea branches into the left and right main bronchi.
    \n\nThe trachea is surrounded by 16\u201320 rings of hyaline cartilage; these
    'rings' are 4 millimetres high in the adult, incomplete and C-shaped. \n\nLigaments
    connect the rings. \n\nThe trachealis muscle connects the ends of the incomplete
    rings and runs along the back wall of the trachea. \n\nAlso adventitia, which
    is the outermost layer of connective tissue that surrounds the hyaline cartilage,
    contributes to the trachea's ability to bend and stretch with movement.\n\nThe
    trachea begins at the lower edge of the cricoid cartilage of the larynx and ends
    at the carina, the point where the trachea branches into left and right main
    bronchi. \n\nThe trachea begins level with the sixth cervical vertebra (C6),
    and the carina is found at the level of the fourth thoracic vertebra (T4), although
    its position may change with breathing.\n\n\n=== Nearby structures ===\n\nThe
    trachea passes by many structures of the neck and chest (thorax) along its course.\nIn
    front of the upper trachea lies connective tissue and skin. \n\nSeveral other
    structures pass over or sit on the trachea; the jugular arch, which joins the
    two anterior jugular veins, sits in front of the upper part of the trachea. \n\nThe
    sternohyoid and sternothyroid muscles stretch along its length. \n\nThe thyroid
    gland also stretches across the upper trachea, with the isthmus overlying the
    second to fourth rings, and the lobes stretching to the level of the fifth or
    sixth cartilage. \n\nThe blood vessels of the thyroid rest on the trachea next
    to the isthmus; superior thyroid arteries join just above it, and the inferior
    thyroid veins below it. \n\nIn front of the lower trachea lies the manubrium
    of the sternum, the remnants of the thymus in adults. \n\nTo the front left lie
    the large blood vessels the aortic arch and its branches the left common carotid
    artery and the brachiocephalic trunk; and the left brachiocephalic vein. \n\nThe
    deep cardiac plexus and lymph nodes are also positioned in front of the lower
    trachea.Behind the trachea, along its length, sits the oesophagus, followed by
    connective tissue and the vertebral column. \n\nTo its sides run the carotid
    arteries and inferior thyroid arteries; and to its sides on its back surface
    run the recurrent laryngeal nerves in the upper trachea, and the vagus nerves
    in the lower trachea.\n\nThe trachealis muscle contracts during coughing, reducing
    the size of the lumen of the trachea.\n\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Blood and lymphatic supply
    ===\n\n\nThe upper part of trachea receives and drains blood through the inferior
    thyroid arteries and veins; the lower trachea receives blood from bronchial arteries.
    \n\nArteries that supply the trachea do so via small branches that supply the
    trachea from the sides. \n\nAs the branches approach the wall of the trachea,
    they split into inferior and superior branches, which join with the branches
    of the arteries above and below; these then split into branches that supply the
    anterior and posterior parts of the trachea. \n\nThe inferior thyroid arteries
    arise just below the isthmus of the thyroid, which sits atop the trachea. \n\nThese
    arteries join (anastamoses) with ascending branches of the bronchial arteries,
    which are direct branches from the aorta, to supply blood to the trachea. \n\nThe
    lymphatic vessels of the trachea drain into the pretracheal nodes that lie in
    front of the trachea, and paratracheal lymph nodes that lie beside it.\n\n\n===
    Development ===\n\nIn the fourth week of development of the human embryo as the
    respiratory bud grows, the trachea separates from the foregut through the formation
    of ridges which eventually separate the trachea from the oesophagus, the tracheoesophageal
    septum. \n\nThis separates the future trachea from the oesophagus and divides
    the foregut tube into the laryngotracheal tube. \n\nBy the start of the fifth
    week, the left and right main bronchi have begin to form, initially as buds at
    the terminal end of the trachea.The trachea is no more than 4mm diameter during
    the first year of life, expanding to its adult diameter of approximately 2cm
    by late childhood. \n\nThe trachea is more circular and more vertical in children
    compared to adults, varies more in size, and also varies more in its position
    in relation to its surrounding structures.\n\n\n=== Microanatomy ===\n\nThe trachea
    is lined with a layer of interspersed layers of column-shaped cells with cilia.
    \n\nThe epithelium contains goblet cells, which are glandular, column-shaped
    cells that produce mucins, the main component of mucus. \n\nMucus helps to moisten
    and protect the airways. \n\nMucus lines the ciliated cells of the trachea to
    trap inhaled foreign particles that the cilia then waft upward toward the larynx
    and then the pharynx where it can be either swallowed into the stomach or expelled
    as phlegm. \n\nThis self-clearing mechanism is termed mucociliary clearance.The
    trachea is surrounded by 16 to 20 rings of hyaline cartilage; these 'rings' are
    incomplete and C-shaped. \n\nTwo or more of the cartilages often unite, partially
    or completely, and they are sometimes bifurcated at their extremities. \n\nThe
    rings are generally highly elastic but they may calcify with age.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n==
    Function ==\n\nThe trachea is one part of the respiratory tree that is a conduit
    for air to pass through on its way to or from the alveoli of the lungs. \n\nThis
    transmits oxygen to the body and removes carbon dioxide.\n\n\n== Use in killing
    humans ==\n\nCrushing the trachea is a common tactic for temporarily or permanently
    disabling another human and is taught in the military, martial arts and police
    forces around the world.\n\n\n== Clinical significance ==\n\n\n\n=== Inflammation
    and infection ===\n\nInflammation of the trachea is known as tracheitis, usually
    due to an infection. \n\nIt is usually caused by viral infections, with bacterial
    infections occurring almost entirely in children. \n\nMost commonly, infections
    occur with inflammation of other parts of the respiratory tract, such as the
    larynx and bronchi, known as croup, however bacterial infections may also affect
    the trachea alone, although they are often associated with a recent viral infection.
    \n\nViruses that cause croup are generally the parainfluenza viruses 1\u20133,
    with influenza viruses A and B also causing croup, but usually causing more serious
    infections; bacteria may also cause croup and include Staphylococcus aureus,
    Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Moraxella catarrhalis. \n\nCauses
    of bacterial infection of the trachea are most commonly Staphylococcus aureus
    and Streptococcus pneumoniae. \n\nIn patients who are in hospital, additional
    bacteria that may cause tracheitis include Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae,
    and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.A person affected with tracheitis may start with symptoms
    that suggest an upper respiratory tract infection such as a cough, sore throat,
    or coryzal symptoms such as a runny nose. \n\nFevers may develop and an affected
    child may develop difficulty breathing and sepsis. \n\nSwelling of the airway
    can cause narrowing of the airway, causing a hoarse breathing sound called stridor,
    or even cause complete blockage. \n\nUnfortunately, up to 80% of people affected
    by bacterial tracheitis require the use of mechanical ventilation, and treatment
    may include endoscopy for the purposes of acquiring microbiological specimens
    for culture and sensitivity, as well as removal of any dead tissue associated
    with the infection. \n\nTreatment in such situations usually includes antibiotics.\n\n\n===
    Narrowing ===\n\n\nA trachea may be narrowed or compressed, usually a result
    of enlarged nearby lymph nodes; cancers of the trachea or nearby structures;
    large thyroid goitres; or rarely as a result of other processes such as unusually
    swollen blood vessels. \n\nScarring from tracheobronchial injury or intubation;
    or inflammation associated with granulomatosis with polyangiitis may also cause
    a narrowing of the trachea (tracheal stenosis). \n\nObstruction invariably causes
    a harsh breathing sound known as stridor. \n\nA camera inserted via the mouth
    down into the trachea, called bronchoscopy, may be performed to investigate the
    cause of an obstruction. \n\nManagement of obstructions depends on the cause.
    \n\nObstructions as a result of malignancy may be managed with surgery, chemotherapy
    or radiotherapy. \n\nA stent may be inserted over the obstruction. \n\nBenign
    lesions, such as narrowing resulting from scarring, are likely to be surgically
    excised.One cause of narrowing is tracheomalacia, which is the tendency for the
    trachea to collapse when there is increased external pressure, such as when airflow
    is increased during breathing in or out, due to decreased compliance. \n\nIt
    can be due to congenital causes, or due to things that develop after birth, such
    as compression from nearby masses or swelling, or trauma. \n\nCongenital tracheomalacia
    can occur by itself or in association with other abnormalities such as bronchomalacia
    or laryngomalacia, and abnormal connections between the trachea and the oesophagus,
    amongst others. \n\nCongenital tracheomalacia often improves without specific
    intervention; when required, interventions may include beta agonists and muscarinic
    agonists, which enhance the tone of the smooth muscle surrounding the trachea;
    positive pressure ventilation, or surgery, which may include the placement of
    a stent, or the removal of the affected part of the trachea. \n\nIn dogs, particularly
    miniature dogs and toy dogs, tracheomalacia, as well as bronchomalacia, can lead
    to tracheal collapse, which often presents with a honking goose-like cough.\n\n\n===
    Intubation ===\n\n\nTracheal intubation refers to the insertion of a tube down
    the trachea. \n\nThis procedure is commonly performed during surgery, in order
    to ensure a person receives enough oxygen when sedated. \n\nThe catheter is connected
    to a machine that monitors the airflow, oxygenation and several other metrics.
    \n\nThis is often one of the responsibilities of an anaesthetist during surgery.\nIn
    an emergency, or when tracheal intubation is deemed impossible, a tracheotomy
    is often performed to insert a tube for ventilation, usually when needed for
    particular types of surgery to be carried out so that the airway can be kept
    open. \n\nThe provision of the opening via a tracheotomy is called a tracheostomy.
    \n\nAnother method procedure can be carried, in an emergency situation, and this
    is a cricothyrotomy.\n\n\n=== Congenital disorders ===\n\n\nTracheal agenesis
    is a rare birth defect in which the trachea fails to develop. \n\nThe defect
    is usually fatal though sometimes surgical intervention has been successful.\nA
    tracheoesophageal fistula is a congenital defect in which the trachea and esophagus
    are abnormally connected (a fistula). \n\nThis is because of abnormalities in
    the separation between the trachea and oesophagus during development. \n\nThis
    occurs in approximately 1 in 3000 births, and the most common abnormalities is
    a separation of the upper and lower ends of the oesophagus, with the upper end
    finishing in a closed pouch. \n\nOther abnormalities may be associated with this,
    including cardiac abnormalities, or VACTERL syndrome. \n\nSuch fistulas may be
    detected before a baby is born because of excess amniotic fluid; after birth,
    they are often associated with pneumonitis and pneumonia because of aspiration
    of food contents. \n\nCongenital fistulas are often treated by surgical repair.
    \n\nIn adults, fistulas may occur because of erosion into the trachea from nearby
    malignant tumours, which erode into both the trachea and the oesophagus. \n\nInitially,
    these often result in coughing from swallowed contents of the oesophagus that
    are aspirated through the trachea, often progressing to fatal pneumonia; unfortunately,
    there is rarely a curative treatment. \n\nA tracheo-oesophageal puncture is a
    surgically created hole between the trachea and the esophagus in a person who
    has had their larynx removed. \n\nAir travels upwards from the surgical connection
    to the upper oesophagus and the pharynx, creating vibrations that create sound
    that can be used for speech. \n\nThe purpose of the puncture is to restore a
    person's ability to speak after the vocal cords have been removed.Sometimes as
    an anatomical variation one or more of the tracheal rings are formed as complete
    rings, rather than horseshoe shaped rings. \n\nThese O rings are smaller than
    the normal C-shaped rings and can cause narrowing (stenosis) of the trachea,
    resulting in breathing difficulties. \n\nAn operation called a slide tracheoplasty
    can open up the rings and rejoin them as wider rings, shortening the length of
    the trachea. \n\nSlide tracheoplasty is said to be the best option in treating
    tracheal stenosis.Mounier-Kuhn syndrome is a rare congenital disorder of an abnormally
    enlarged trachea, characterised by absent elastic fibres, smooth muscle thinning,
    and a tendency to get recurrent respiratory tract infections.\n\n\n=== Replacement
    ===\n\nFrom 2008, operations have experimentally replaced tracheas, with those
    grown from stem cells, or with synthetic substitutes, however this is regarded
    as experimental and there is no standardised method. \n\nDifficulties with ensuring
    adequate blood supply to the replaced trachea is considered a major challenge
    to any replacement. \n\nAdditionally, no evidence has been found to support the
    placement of stem cells taken from bone marrow on the trachea as a way of stimulating
    tissue regeneration, and such a method remains hypothetical.In January 2021,
    surgeons at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York performed the first complete trachea
    transplantation. \n\nThe 18-hour procedure included harvesting a trachea from
    a donor and implanting it in the patient, connecting numerous veins and arteries
    to provide sufficient blood flow to the organ.\n\n\n== Other animals ==\n\nAllowing
    for variations in the length of the neck, the trachea in other mammals is, in
    general, similar to that in humans. \n\nGenerally, it is also similar to the
    reptilian trachea.\n\n\n=== Vertebrates ===\n\nIn birds, the trachea runs from
    the pharynx to the syrinx, from which the primary bronchi diverge. \n\nSwans
    have an unusually elongated trachea, part of which is coiled beneath the sternum;
    this may act as a resonator to amplify sound. \n\nIn some birds, the tracheal
    rings are complete, and may even be ossified.In amphibians, the trachea is normally
    extremely short, and leads directly into the lungs, without clear primary bronchi.
    \n\nA longer trachea is, however, found in some long-necked salamanders, and
    in caecilians. \n\nWhile there are irregular cartilagenous nodules on the amphibian
    trachea, these do not form the rings found in amniotes.The only vertebrates to
    have lungs, but no trachea, are the lungfish and the Polypterus, in which the
    lungs arise directly from the pharynx.\n\n\n=== Invertebrates ===\n\n\nThe word
    trachea is used to define a very different organ in invertebrates than in vertebrates.
    \n\nInsects have an open respiratory system made up of spiracles, tracheae, and
    tracheoles to transport metabolic gases to and from tissues. \n\nThe distribution
    of spiracles can vary greatly among the many orders of insects, but in general
    each segment of the body can have only one pair of spiracles, each of which connects
    to an atrium and has a relatively large tracheal tube behind it. \n\nThe tracheae
    are invaginations of the cuticular exoskeleton that branch (anastomose) throughout
    the body with diameters from only a few micrometres up to 0.8 mm. \n\nDiffusion
    of oxygen and carbon dioxide takes place across the walls of the smallest tubes,
    called tracheoles, which penetrate tissues and even indent individual cells.
    \n\nGas may be conducted through the respiratory system by means of active ventilation
    or passive diffusion. \n\nUnlike vertebrates, insects do not generally carry
    oxygen in their haemolymph.\nThis is one of the factors that may limit their
    size.\nA tracheal tube may contain ridge-like circumferential rings of taenidia
    in various geometries such as loops or helices. \n\nTaenidia provide strength
    and flexibility to the trachea. \n\nIn the head, thorax, or abdomen, tracheae
    may also be connected to air sacs. \n\nMany insects, such as grasshoppers and
    bees, which actively pump the air sacs in their abdomen, are able to control
    the flow of air through their body. \n\nIn some aquatic insects, the tracheae
    exchange gas through the body wall directly, in the form of a gill, or function
    essentially as normal, via a plastron. \n\nNote that despite being internal,
    the tracheae of arthropods are lined with cuticular tissue and are shed during
    moulting (ecdysis).\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trachea"

  descriptionText: "\n\nEJACULATORY DUCT\n\n\nThe ejaculatory ducts (ductus ejaculatorii)
    are paired structures in male anatomy. \n\nEach ejaculatory duct is formed by
    the union of the vas deferens with the duct of the seminal vesicle. \n\nThey
    pass through the prostate, and open into the urethra above the seminal colliculus.
    \n\nDuring ejaculation, semen passes through the prostate gland, enters the urethra
    and exits the body via the urinary meatus.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\n\n\n=== Ejaculation
    ===\n\n\nEjaculation occurs in two stages, the emission stage and the expulsion
    stage. \n\nThe emission stage involves the workings of several structures of
    the ejaculatory duct; contractions of the prostate gland, the seminal vesicles,
    the bulbourethral gland and the vas deferens push fluids into the prostatic urethra.
    \n\nThe semen is stored here until ejaculation occurs. \n\nMuscles at the base
    of the penis contract in order to propel the seminal fluid trapped in the prostatic
    urethra through the penile urethra and expel it through the urinary meatus. \n\nThe
    ejaculate is expelled in spurts, due to the movement of the muscles propelling
    it. \n\nThese muscle contractions are related to the sensations of orgasm for
    the male.Sperm is produced in the testes and enters the ejaculatory ducts via
    the vas deferens. \n\nAs it passes by the seminal vesicles, a fluid rich in fructose
    combines with sperm. \n\nThis addition nourishes the sperm in order to keep it
    active and motile. \n\nSeminal fluid continues down the ejaculatory duct into
    the prostate gland, where an alkaline prostatic fluid is added. \n\nThis addition
    provides the texture and odor associated with semen. \n\nThe alkalinity of the
    prostatic fluid serves to neutralize the acidity of the female vaginal tract
    in order to prolong the survival of sperm in this harsh environment. \n\nSemen
    is now a fructose-rich, alkaline fluid containing sperm as it enters the bulbourethral
    glands below the prostate. \n\nThe bulbourethral glands secrete a small amount
    of clear fluid into the urethra before the ejaculate is expelled. \n\nThe functions
    of this fluid are not entirely known but are suggested to aid in lubricating
    the male urethra in preparation for the semen during ejaculation. \n\nThe amount
    of semen produced and expelled during ejaculation corresponds to the length of
    time that the male is sexually aroused before ejaculation occurs. \n\nGenerally,
    the longer the period of arousal, the larger the amount of seminal fluid.Ejaculation
    and orgasm may occur simultaneously, however they are not coupled, in that one
    may occur without the other. \n\nFor example, a man may have a dry orgasm (termed
    Retrograde ejaculation); there is no expulsion of ejaculate however the man still
    experiences orgasm. \n\nAlso, paraplegics may ejaculate seminal fluid but not
    experience the sensation of orgasm.\n\n\n== Clinical relevance ==\n\n\n\n===
    Ejaculatory duct obstruction ===\n\n\nEjaculatory duct obstruction is an acquired
    or congenital pathological condition in which one or both ejaculatory ducts are
    obstructed. \n\nIn the case that both ejaculatory ducts are obstructed, this
    illness presents with the symptoms of aspermia and male infertility.,\n\n\n===
    Benign prostatic hyperplasia ===\n\n\nSurgery to correct benign prostatic hyperplasia
    may destroy these ducts resulting in retrograde ejaculation. \n\nRetrograde ejaculation
    empties the seminal fluid formed in the emission phase into the bladder of the
    male instead of expelling it through the urethra and out the tip of the penis.
    \n\nThis results in a dry orgasm, where orgasm may still be experienced but without
    expulsion of semen from the ejaculatory ducts.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejaculatory_duct"

  descriptionText: "\n\nSUBMANDIBULAR GLAND\n\n\nThe paired submandibular glands
    (historically known as submaxillary glands) are major salivary glands located
    beneath the floor of the mouth. \n\nThey each weigh about 15 grams and contribute
    some 60\u201367% of unstimulated saliva secretion; on stimulation their contribution
    decreases in proportion as the parotid secretion rises to 50%. \n\nThe average
    length of the normal human submandibular salivary gland is approximately 27mm,
    while the average width is approximately 14.3mm.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\n\nLying
    superior to the digastric muscles, each submandibular gland is divided into superficial
    and deep lobes, which are separated by the mylohyoid muscle:\nThe superficial
    lobe comprises most of the gland, with the mylohyoid muscle runs under it\nThe
    deep lobe is the smaller partSecretions are delivered into the submandibular
    duct on the deep portion after which they hook around the posterior edge of the
    mylohyoid muscle and proceed on the superior surface laterally. \n\nThe excretory
    ducts are then crossed by the lingual nerve, and ultimately drain into the sublingual
    caruncles \u2013 small prominences on either side of the lingual frenulum along
    with the major sublingual duct. \n\nThe gland can be bilaterally palpated (felt)
    inferior and posterior to the body of the mandible, moving inward from the inferior
    border of the mandible near its angle with the head tilted forwards.\n\n\n===
    Microanatomy ===\n\n\nLobes contain smaller lobules, which contain adenomeres,
    the secretory units of the gland. \n\nEach adenomer contains one or more acini,
    or alveoli, which are small clusters of cells that secrete their products into
    a duct. \n\nThe acini of each adenomere are composed of either serous or mucous
    cells, with serous adenomeres predominating. \n\nSome mucous adenomeres may also
    be capped with a serous demilune, a layer of lysozyme-secreting serous cells
    resembling a half moon.\nLike other exocrine glands, the submandibular gland
    can be classified by the microscopic anatomy of its secretory cells and how they
    are arranged. \n\nBecause the glands are branched, and because the tubules forming
    the branches contain secretory cells, submandibular glands are classified as
    branched tubuloacinar glands. \n\nFurther, because the secretory cells are of
    both serous and mucous types, the submandibular gland is a mixed gland, and though
    most of the cells are serous, the exudate is chiefly mucous. \n\nIt has long
    striated ducts and short intercalated ducts.The secretory acinar cells of the
    submandibular gland have distinct functions. \n\nThe mucous cells are the most
    active and therefore the major product of the submandibular glands is saliva
    which is mucoid in nature. \n\nMucous cells secrete mucin which aids in the lubrication
    of the food bolus as it travels through the esophagus. \n\nIn addition, the serous
    cells produce salivary amylase, which aids in the breakdown of starches in the
    mouth. \n\nThe submandibular gland's highly active acini account for most of
    the salivary volume. \n\nThe parotid and sublingual glands account for the remaining.\n\n\n===
    Blood supply ===\n\nThe gland receives its blood supply from the facial and lingual
    arteries. \n\nThe gland is supplied by sublingual and submental arteries and
    drained by common facial and lingual veins.\n\n\n=== Lymphatic drainage ===\n\nThe
    lymphatics from submandibular gland first drain into submandibular lymph nodes
    and subsequently into jugulo - digastric lymph nodes.\n\n\n=== Nerve supply ===\n\n\nTheir
    secretions, like the secretions of other salivary glands, are regulated directly
    by the parasympathetic nervous system and indirectly by the sympathetic nervous
    system.\n\nParasympathetic innervation to the submandibular glands is provided
    by the superior salivatory nucleus via the chorda tympani, a branch of the facial
    nerve, that becomes part of the trigeminal nerve's lingual nerve prior to synapsing
    on the submandibular ganglion. \n\nIncreased parasympathetic activity promotes
    the secretion of saliva.\nThe sympathetic nervous system regulates submandibular
    secretions through vasoconstriction of the arteries that supply it. \n\nIncreased
    sympathetic activity reduces glandular bloodflow, thereby decreasing the volume
    of fluid in salivary secretions, producing an enzyme rich mucous saliva. \n\nNevertheless,
    direct stimulation of sympathetic nerves will cause an increase in salivary enzymatic
    secretions. \n\nIn sum, the volume decreases, but the secretions are increased
    by parasympathetic and sympathetic innervation.\n\n\n=== Development ===\n\nThe
    submandibular salivary glands develop later than the parotid glands and appear
    late in the sixth week of prenatal development. \n\nThey develop bilaterally
    from epithelial buds in the sulcus surrounding the sublingual folds on the floor
    of the primitive mouth. \n\nSolid cords branch from the buds and grow posteriorly,
    lateral to the developing tongue. \n\nThe cords of the submandibular gland later
    branch further and then become canalized to form the ductal part. \n\nThe submandibular
    gland acini develop from the cords\u2019 rounded terminal ends at 12 weeks, and
    secretory activity via the submandibular duct begins at 16 weeks. \n\nGrowth
    of the submandibular gland continues after birth with the formation of more acini.
    \n\nLateral to both sides of the tongue, a linear groove develops and closes
    over to form the submandibular duct.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\nThe submandibular
    gland releases a host of factors which regulate systemic inflammatory responses
    and modulate systemic immune and inflammatory reactions. \n\nEarly work in identifying
    factors that played a role in the cervical sympathetic trunk-submandibular gland
    (CST-SMG) axis lead to the discovery of a seven amino acid peptide, called the
    submandibular gland peptide-T. \n\nSGP-T was demonstrated to have biological
    activity and thermoregulatory properties related to endotoxin exposure. \n\nSGP-T,
    an isolate of the submandibular gland, demonstrated its immunoregulatory properties
    and potential role in modulating the CST-SMG axis, and subsequently was shown
    to play an important role in the control of inflammation. \n\n\n== Clinical significance
    ==\n\n\nThe submandibular gland accounts for 80% of all salivary duct calculi
    (salivary stones or sialolith), possibly due to the different nature of the saliva
    that it produces and the tortuous travel of the submandibular duct to its ductal
    opening for a considerable upward distance. \n\nThe submandibular gland is one
    of the major three glands that provide the mouth with saliva. \n\nThe\ntwo other
    types of salivary glands are parotid and sublingual glands.\n\n\n=== Dissection

  descriptionText: "\n\nSUBLINGUAL GLAND\n\n\nThe paired sublingual glands are major
    salivary glands in the mouth. \n\nThey are the smallest, most diffuse, and the
    only unencapsulated major salivary glands. \n\nThey provide only 3-5% of the
    total salivary volume. \n\nThere are also two other types of salivary glands;
    they are submandibular and parotid glands.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThey lie anterior
    and superior to the submandibular gland and inferior and lateral to the tongue,
    as well as beneath the mucous membrane of the floor of the mouth. \n\nThey are
    bounded laterally by the bone of the mandible and inferolaterally by the mylohyoid
    muscle. \n\nThe glands can be felt behind each mandibular canine. \n\nPlacing
    one index finger within the mouth and the fingertips of the opposite hand outside
    it, the compressed gland is manually palpated between the inner and outer fingers.\nThe
    sublingual glands are drained by 8-20 excretory ducts called the ducts of Rivinus.
    \n\nThe largest of all, the sublingual duct (of Bartholin) joins the submandibular
    duct to drain through the sublingual caruncle. \n\nThe sublingual caruncle is
    a small papilla near the midline of the floor of the mouth on each side of the
    lingual frenum. \n\nMost of the remaining small sublingual ducts (of Rivinus)
    open separate into the mouth on an elevated crest of mucous membrane, the plica
    sublingualis (aka sublingual fold), formed by the gland and located on either
    side of the frenulum linguae. \n\n\n=== Microanatomy ===\n\nThe sublingual gland
    consists mostly of mucous acini capped with serous demilunes and is therefore
    categorized as a mixed mucous gland with a mucous product predominating. \n\nStriated
    and intercalated ducts are also present.\n\n\n=== Blood supply ===\n\nThe gland
    receives its blood supply from the sublingual and submental arteries. \n\nLymph
    from the sublingual salivary gland drains into the submandibular lymph nodes.\n\n\n===
    Nerve supply ===\n\nThe chorda tympani nerve (from the facial nerve via the submandibular
    ganglion) is secretomotor and provides parasympathetic supply to the sublingual
    glands. \n\nThe path of the nerve is as follows: junction between pons and medulla,
    through internal acoustic meatus and facial canal to chorda tympani, through
    middle ear cavity, out petrotympanic fissure to join the lingual nerve, travels
    with lingual nerve to synapse at the submandibular ganglion, then postganglionic
    fibers travels to the sublingual gland.\n\n\n=== Development ===\n\nThe sublingual
    salivary glands appear in the eighth week of prenatal development, two weeks
    later than the other two major salivary glands. \n\nThey develop from epithelial
    buds in the sulcus surrounding the sublingual folds on the floor of the mouth,
    lateral to the developing submandibular gland. \n\nThese buds branch and form
    into cords that canalize to form the sublingual ducts associated with the gland.
    \n\nThe rounded terminal ends of the cords form acini.\n\n\n== Clinical significance
    ==\n\n\nRanulas are the most common pathologic lesion associated with the sublingual
    glands.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sublingual_gland"

  descriptionText: "\n\nTAENIA COLI\n\n\nThe taeniae coli (also teniae coli or tenia
    coli) are three separate longitudinal ribbons (taeniae meaning ribbon in Latin)
    of smooth muscle on the outside of the ascending, transverse, descending and
    sigmoid colons. \n\nThey are visible and can be seen just below the serosa or
    fibrosa. \n\nThere are three teniae coli: mesocolic, free and omental taeniae
    coli. \n\nThe teniae coli contract lengthwise to produce the haustra, the bulges
    in the colon.\nThe bands converge at the root of the vermiform appendix. \n\nAt
    the rectosigmoid junction, the taeniae spread out and unite to form the longitudinal
    muscle layer. \n\nIn the caecum, the ascending colon, the descending colon and
    sigmoid colon the positions of these bands are fixed. \n\nThe taenia libera,
    is placed anteriorly in the caecum, ascending, descending and sigmoid colon,
    but is placed inferiorly in the transverse colon. \n\nThe taenia mesocolica is
    present on the posteromedial surface of caecum, ascending, descending and sigmoid
    colon, but is placed posteriorly on transverse colon at the site of attachment
    of transverse mesocolon. \n\nThe taenia omentalis is situated posterolaterally
    in caecum, ascending, descending and sigmoid colon, but is situated on the anterosuperior
    surface of transverse colon where layers three and four of the greater omentum
    meet the transverse colon. \n\nThis change in position is due to the twist in
    transverse colon. \n\nThese bands correspond to the outer layer of the muscularis
    externa, in other portions of the digestive tract.\n\nThe teniae coli are regulated
    by the sacral nerves of the spinal cord, which are under control of the parasympathetic
    nervous system.\n\n\n== Diverticulosis ==\n\n\nSpaces between the circular bands
    of taeniae are weak points in the bowel, and are the sites of diverticulosis.
    \n\nMost diverticulosis occur in the sigmoid colon as it is the segment with
    the highest intraluminal pressure. \n\nDiverticulosis does not occur in the rectum
    as the tenia coli become a continuous muscular layer. \n\nDiverticulosis can
    then become diverticulitis if the patient develops inflammation of the diverticulosis,
    this whole spectrum of disease is called diverticular disease.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taenia_coli"

    travel, for the suspension and the supply of the colon.\n\nFeneis 210.16\n\nThe
    mesocolon was thought to be a fragmented structure, with all named parts\u2014the
    ascending, transverse, descending, and sigmoid mesocolons, the mesoappendix,
    and the mesorectum\u2014separately terminating their insertion into the posterior
    abdominal wall.\n\nHowever, in 2012, new microscopic and electron microscopic
    examinations showed the mesocolon to be a single structure derived from the duodenojejunal
    flexure and extending to the distal mesorectal layer.\n\nThe mesocolon regions
    were traditionally taught to be separate sections with separate insertions into
    the posterior abdominal wall. \n\nIn 2012, the first detailed observational and
    histological studies of the mesocolon were undertaken and this revealed several
    new findings.\n\nThe study included 109 patients undergoing open, elective, total
    abdominal colectomy. \n\nAnatomical observations were recorded during the surgery
    and on the post-operative specimens.\n\nThese studies showed that the mesocolon
    is continuous from the ileocaecal to the rectosigmoid level. \n\nIt was also
    shown that a mesenteric confluence occurs at the ileocaecal and rectosigmoid
    junctions, as well as at the hepatic and splenic flexures and that each confluence
    involves peritoneal and omental attachments. \n\nThe proximal rectum was shown
    to originate at the confluence of the mesorectum and mesosigmoid. \n\nA plane
    occupied by perinephric fascia was shown to separate the entire apposed small
    intestinal mesentery and the mesocolon from the retroperitoneum. \n\nDeep in
    the pelvis, this fascia coalesces to give rise to presacral fascia.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesentery#Structure"

  descriptionText: "\n\nGINGIVA\n/GUMS\n\n\nThe gums or gingiva (plural: gingivae)
    consist of the mucosal tissue that lies over the mandible and maxilla inside
    the mouth. \n\nGum health and disease can have an effect on general health.\n\n\n==
    Structure ==\n\nThe gums are part of the soft tissue lining of the mouth. \n\nThey
    surround the teeth and provide a seal around them. \n\nUnlike the soft tissue
    linings of the lips and cheeks, most of the gums are tightly bound to the underlying
    bone which helps resist the friction of food passing over them. \n\nThus when
    healthy, it presents an effective barrier to the barrage of periodontal insults
    to deeper tissue. \n\nHealthy gums are usually coral pink in light skinned people,
    and may be naturally darker with melanin pigmentation.\n\nChanges in color, particularly
    increased redness, together with swelling and an increased tendency to bleed,
    suggest an inflammation that is possibly due to the accumulation of bacterial
    plaque. \n\nOverall, the clinical appearance of the tissue reflects the underlying
    histology, both in health and disease. \n\nWhen gum tissue is not healthy, it
    can provide a gateway for periodontal disease to advance into the deeper tissue
    of the periodontium, leading to a poorer prognosis for long-term retention of
    the teeth. \n\nBoth the type of periodontal therapy and homecare instructions
    given to patients by dental professionals and restorative care are based on the
    clinical conditions of the tissue.\n\nThe gums are divided anatomically into
    marginal, attached and interdental areas.\n\n\n=== Marginal gums ===\n\nThe marginal
    gum is the edge of the gums surrounding the teeth in collar-like fashion. \n\nIn
    about half of individuals, it is demarcated from the adjacent, attached gums
    by a shallow linear depression, the free gingival groove. \n\nThis slight depression
    on the outer surface of the gum does not correspond to the depth of the gingival
    sulcus but instead to the apical border of the junctional epithelium. \n\nThis
    outer groove varies in depth according to the area of the oral cavity. \n\nThe
    groove is very prominent on mandibular anteriors and premolars.\n\nThe marginal
    gum varies in width from 0.5 to 2.0 mm from the free gingival crest to the attached
    gingiva. \n\nThe marginal gingiva follows the scalloped pattern established by
    the contour of the cementoenamel junction (CEJ) of the teeth. \n\nThe marginal
    gingiva has a more translucent appearance than the attached gingiva, yet has
    a similar clinical appearance, including pinkness, dullness, and firmness. \n\nIn
    contrast, the marginal gingiva lacks the presence of stippling, and the tissue
    is mobile or free from the underlying tooth surface, as can be demonstrated with
    a periodontal probe. \n\nThe marginal gingiva is stabilized by the gingival fibers
    that have no bony support. \n\nThe gingival margin, or free gingival crest, at
    the most superficial part of the marginal gingiva, is also easily seen clinically,
    and its location should be recorded on a patient's chart.\n\n\n=== Attached gum
    ===\n\nThe attached gums are continuous with the marginal gum. \n\nIt is firm,
    resilient, and tightly bound to the underlying periosteum of alveolar bone. \n\nThe
    facial aspect of the attached gum extends to the relatively loose and movable
    alveolar mucosa, from which it is demarcated by the mucogingival junction. \n\nAttached
    gum may present with surface stippling. \n\nThe tissue when dried is dull, firm,
    and immobile, with varying amounts of stippling. \n\nThe width of the attached
    gum varies according to its location. \n\nThe width of the attached gum on the
    facial aspect differs in different areas of the mouth. \n\nIt is generally greatest
    in the incisor region (3.5 to 4.5 mm in the maxilla and 3.3 to 3.9 mm in the
    mandible) and less in the posterior segments, with the least width in the first
    premolar area (1.9 mm in the maxilla and 1.8 mm in the mandible). \n\nHowever,
    certain levels of attached gum may be necessary for the stability of the underlying
    root of the tooth.\n\n\n=== Interdental gum ===\n\nThe interdental gum lies between
    the teeth. \n\nThey occupy the gingival embrasure, which is the interproximal
    space beneath the area of tooth contact. \n\nThe interdental papilla can be pyramidal
    or have a \"col\" shape. \n\nAttached gums are resistant to the forces of chewing
    and covered in keratin.\n\nThe col varies in depth and width, depending on the
    expanse of the contacting tooth surfaces. \n\nThe epithelium covering the col
    consists of the marginal gum of the adjacent teeth, except that it is nonkeratinized.
    \n\nIt is mainly present in the broad interdental gingiva of the posterior teeth,
    and generally is not present with those interproximal tissue associated with
    anterior teeth because the latter tissue is narrower. \n\nIn the absence of contact
    between adjacent teeth, the attached gum extends uninterrupted from the facial
    to the lingual aspect. \n\nThe col may be important in the formation of periodontal
    disease but is visible clinically only when teeth are extracted.\n\nInterdental
    AreasIt is the part of gum which extends in between two teeth up to the contact
    point. \n\nThere is a facial side interdental papilla and a lingual side interdental
    papilla. \n\nInterdental papilla has a summit and margins that are concave. \n\nThe
    tip and the margins are unattached and the central portion attached. \n\nIn inflammations
    the interdental papilla loses its concavity.\n\n\n== Characteristics of healthy
    gums ==\n\n=== Color ===\n\nHealthy gums usually have a color that has been described
    as \"coral pink\". \n\nOther colours like red, white, and blue can signify inflammation
    (gingivitis) or pathology. \n\nSmoking or drug use can cause discoloring as well
    (such as \"meth mouth\"). \n\nAlthough described as the colour coral pink, variation
    in colour is possible. \n\nThis can be the result of factors such as: thickness
    and degree of keratinization of the epithelium, blood flow to the gums, natural
    pigmentation of the skin, disease, and medications.\n\nSince the colour of the
    gums can vary, uniformity of colour is more important than the underlying color
    itself. \n\nExcess deposits of melanin can cause dark spots or patches on the
    gums (melanin gingival hyperpigmentation), especially at the base of the interdental
    papillae. \n\nGum depigmentation (aka gum bleaching) is a procedure used in cosmetic
    dentistry to remove these discolorations.\n\n\n=== Contour ===\n\nHealthy gums
    have a smooth curved or scalloped appearance around each tooth. \n\nHealthy gums
    fill and fit each space between the teeth, unlike the swollen gum papilla seen
    in gingivitis or the empty interdental embrasure seen in periodontal disease.
    \n\nHealthy gums hold tight to each tooth in that the gum surface narrows to
    \"knife-edge\" thin at the free gingival margin. \n\nOn the other hand, inflamed
    gums have a \"puffy\" or \"rolled\" margin.\n\n\n=== Texture ===\n\nHealthy gums
    have a firm texture that is resistant to movement, and the surface texture often
    exhibits surface stippling. \n\nUnhealthy gums, on the other hand, is often swollen
    and less firm. \n\nHealthy gums have an orange-peel like texture to it due to
    the stippling.\n\n\n=== Reaction to disturbance ===\n\nHealthy gums usually have
    no reaction to normal disturbance such as brushing or periodontal probing. \n\nUnhealthy
    gums, conversely, will show bleeding on probing (BOP) and/or purulent exudate.\n\n\n==
    Clinical significance ==\n\nThe gingival cavity microecosystem, fueled by food
    residues and saliva, can support the growth of many microorganisms, of which
    some can be injurious to health. \n\nImproper or insufficient oral hygiene can
    thus lead to many gum and periodontal disorders, including gingivitis or periodontitis,
    which are major causes for tooth failure. \n\nRecent studies have also shown
    that anabolic steroids are also closely associated with gingival enlargement
    requiring a gingivectomy for many cases. \n\nGingival recession is when there
    is an apical movement of the gum margin away from the biting (occlusal) surface.
    \n\nIt may indicate an underlying inflammation such as periodontitis or pyorrhea,
    a pocket formation, dry mouth or displacement of the marginal gums away from
    the tooth by mechanical (such as brushing), chemical, or surgical means. \n\nGingival
    retraction, in turn, may expose the dental neck and leave it vulnerable to the
    action of external stimuli, and may cause root sensitivity.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gums"

  descriptionText: "\n\nPAROTID DUCT\n\n\nThe parotid duct, or Stensen duct,is a
    salivary duct. \n\nIt is the route that saliva takes from the major salivary
    gland, the parotid gland, into the mouth.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe parotid
    duct is formed when several interlobular ducts, the largest ducts inside the
    parotid gland, join. \n\nIt emerges from the parotid gland. \n\nIt runs forward
    along the lateral side of the masseter muscle for around 7 cm. \n\nIn this course,
    the duct is surrounded by the buccal fat pad. \n\nIt takes a steep turn at the
    border of the masseter and passes through the buccinator muscle, opening into
    the vestibule of the mouth, the region of the mouth between the cheek and the
    gums, at the parotid papilla, which lies across the second Maxillary (upper)
    molar tooth.\n\nThe buccinator acts as a valve that prevents air forcing into
    the duct, which would cause pneumoparotitis. \n\nRunning along with the duct
    superiorly is the transverse facial artery and upper buccal nerve; running along
    with the duct inferiorly is the lower buccal nerve.\n\nThe exit of the parotid
    ducts can be felt as small bumps (papillae) on both sides of the mouth, and are
    usually positioned next to the maxillary second molars.\n\n\n=== Relations ===\n\nThe
    parotid duct lies close to the buccal branch of the facial nerve (VII). \n\nIt
    is also close to the transverse facial artery.\n\n\n== Clinical significance
    ==\n\nBlockage, whether caused by salivary duct stones or external compression,
    may cause pain and swelling of the parotid gland (parotitis).\n\nKoplik's spots
    which are pathognomonic of measles are found near the opening of the parotid
    duct.\n\nThe parotid duct may be cannulated by inserting a tube through the internal
    orifice in the mouth. \n\nDye may be injected to allow for imaging of the parotid
    duct.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe parotid duct is named after Nicolas Steno (1638\u20131686),
    also known as Niels Stensen, a Danish anatomist (albeit best known as a geologist)
    credited with its detailed description in 1660. \n\nThis is where the alternative
    name \"Stensen duct\" originates from.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parotid_duct"

  descriptionText: "\n\nCORPUS SPONGIOSUM OF PENIS\n\n\nThe corpus spongiosum is
    the mass of spongy tissue surrounding the male urethra within the penis. \n\nIt
    is also called the corpus cavernosum urethrae in older texts.\n\n\n== Anatomy
    ==\n\nPosterior part of the corpus spongiosum is expanded to form the urethral
    bulb, and lies in apposition with the inferior fascia of the urogenital diaphragm,
    from which it receives a fibrous investment.\n\nThe urethra enters the bulb nearer
    to the superior than to the inferior surface. \n\nOn the latter there is a median
    sulcus (groove), from which a thin fibrous septum (wall) projects into the substance
    of the bulb and divides it imperfectly into two lateral lobes or hemispheres.\n\nThe
    portion of the corpus spongiosum in front of the bulb lies in a groove on the
    under surface of the conjoined corpora cavernosa penis. \n\nIt is cylindrical
    in form and tapers slightly from behind forward. \n\nIts anterior end is expanded
    in the form of an obtuse cone, flattened from above downward. \n\nThis expansion,
    termed the glans penis, is moulded on the rounded ends of the corpus cavernosum
    penis, extending farther on their upper than on their lower surfaces.\n\nAt the
    summit of the glans is the slit-like vertical opening known as the external urethral
    orifice, or the urinary meatus.\n\nThe circumference of the base of the glans
    forms a rounded projecting border, the corona of glans penis, overhanging a deep
    retroglandular sulcus, behind which is the neck of the penis.\n\n\n== Function
    ==\n\nThe function of the corpus spongiosum in erection is to prevent the urethra
    from pinching closed, thereby maintaining the urethra as a viable channel for
    ejaculation. \n\nTo do this, the corpus spongiosum remains pliable during erection
    while the corpora cavernosa penis become engorged with blood.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpus_spongiosum_penis"

  descriptionText: "\n\nNEUROHYPOPHYSIS/POSTERIOR PITUITARY\n\n\nThe posterior pituitary
    (or neurohypophysis) is the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland which is part
    of the endocrine system. \n\nThe posterior pituitary is not glandular as is the
    anterior pituitary. \n\nInstead, it is largely a collection of axonal projections
    from the hypothalamus that terminate behind the anterior pituitary, and serve
    as a site for the secretion of neurohypophysial hormones (oxytocin and vasopressin)
    directly into the blood. \n\nThe hypothalamic\u2013neurohypophyseal system is
    composed of the hypothalamus (the paraventricular nucleus and supraoptic nucleus),
    posterior pituitary, and these axonal projections.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe
    posterior pituitary consists mainly of neuronal projections (axons) of magnocellular
    neurosecretory cells extending from the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei
    of the hypothalamus. \n\nThese axons store and release neurohypophysial hormones
    oxytocin and vasopressin into the neurohypophyseal capillaries, from there they
    get into the systemic circulation (and partly back into the hypophyseal portal
    system). \n\nIn addition to axons, the posterior pituitary also contains pituicytes,
    specialized glial cells resembling astrocytes assisting in the storage and release
    of the hormones.\n\nClassification of the posterior pituitary varies, but most
    sources include the two regions below:\n\nPars nervosa\nAlso called the neural
    lobe or posterior lobe, this region constitutes the majority of the posterior
    pituitary and is the storage site of oxytocin and vasopressin. \n\nSometimes
    (incorrectly) considered synonymous with the posterior pituitary, the pars nervosa
    includes Herring bodies and pituicytes.\n\nInfundibular stalk\n\nAlso known as
    the infundibulum or pituitary stalk, the infundibular stalk bridges the hypothalamic
    and hypophyseal systems.\n\nThe median eminence is only occasionally included
    as part of the posterior pituitary. \n\nOther sources specifically exclude it
    from the pituitary.A few sources include the pars intermedia as part of the posterior
    lobe, but this is a minority view. \n\nIt is based upon the gross anatomical
    separation of the posterior and anterior pituitary along the cystic remnants
    of Rathke's pouch, causing the pars intermedia to remain attached to the neurohypophysis.\n\n\n==
    Function ==\n\n\n\n=== Hormone secretion ===\n\nTwo hormones are classically
    considered as being related to the posterior pituitary: oxytocin and vasopressin.
    \n\nThese hormones are created in the hypothalamus and released in the posterior
    pituitary. \n\nAfter creation, they are stored in neurosecretory vesicles regrouped
    into Herring bodies before being secreted in the posterior pituitary via the
    bloodstream.\n\n\n== Clinical significance ==\n\nInsufficient secretion of vasopressin
    underlies diabetes insipidus, a condition in which the body loses the capacity
    to concentrate urine. \n\nAffected individuals excrete as much as 20 liters of
    dilute urine per day. \n\nOversecretion of vasopressin causes the syndrome of
    inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH).\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_pituitary"

  descriptionText: "\n\nUVULA OF PALATE\n\n\nThe palatine uvula, usually referred
    to as simply the uvula, is a conic projection from the back edge of the middle
    of the soft palate, composed of connective tissue containing a number of racemose
    glands, and some muscular fibers.\n\nIt also contains many serous glands, which
    produce thin saliva.\n\nStructure\nMuscle\n\nThe muscular part of the uvula (Latin:
    musculus uvulae) shortens and broadens the uvula. \n\nThis changes the contour
    of the posterior part of the soft palate. \n\nThis change in contour allows the
    soft palate to adapt closely to the posterior pharyngeal wall to help close the
    nasopharynx during swallowing.\n\nIts muscles are controlled by the pharyngeal
    branch of the vagus nerve.\n\n\n==Function==\n\nDuring swallowing, the soft palate
    and the uvula move together to close off the nasopharynx, and prevent food from
    entering the nasal cavity.\n\nIt has also been proposed that the abundant amount
    of thin saliva produced by the uvula serves to keep the throat well lubricated.\n\nIt
    has a function in speech as well. \n\nIn many languages, the uvula is used to
    articulate a range of consonant sounds, known as uvular consonants. \n\nThe voiced
    uvular trill, written [\u0280] in the International Phonetic Alphabet, is one
    example; it is used in French, Arabic and Hebrew, among other languages. \n\nDue
    to the large amount of saliva produced from glands in the uvula that are absent
    in other mammals, it has been suggested that the uvula is an accessory speech
    organ.\n\nStimulation of the uvula also causes the gag reflex to initiate. \n\nThis
    is often a problem for people with uvula piercings, and a common method of inducing
    vomiting.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palatine_uvula"

  descriptionText: "\n\nEPIDIDYMIS\n\n\nThe epididymis (; plural: epididymides or
    ) is a tube that connects a testicle to a vas deferens in the male reproductive
    system. \n\nIt is present in all male reptiles, birds, and mammals. \n\nIt is
    a single, narrow, tightly-coiled tube in adult humans, 6 to 7 meters (20 to 23
    ft) in length connecting the efferent ducts from the rear of each testicle to
    its vas deferens.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe epididymis can be divided into
    three main regions:\n\nThe head (Latin: caput). \n\nThe head of the epididymis
    receives spermatozoa via the efferent ducts of the mediastinium of the testis.
    \n\nIt is characterized histologically by a thick epithelium with long stereocilia
    (described below) and a little smooth muscle. \n\nIt is involved in absorbing
    fluid to make the sperm more concentrated. \n\nThe concentration of the sperm
    here is dilute.\nThe body (Latin: corpus). \n\nThis has an intermediate epithelium
    and smooth muscle thickness.\nThe tail (Latin: cauda). \n\nThis has the thinnest
    epithelium of the three regions and the greatest quantity of smooth muscle.In
    reptiles, there is an additional canal between the testis and the head of the
    epididymis and which receives the various efferent ducts. \n\nThis is, however,
    absent in all birds and mammals.\n\n\n=== Histology ===\n\nThe epididymis is
    covered by a two layered pseudostratified epithelium. \n\nThe epithelium is separated
    by a basement membrane from the connective tissue wall which has smooth muscle
    cells. \n\nThe major cell types in the epithelium are:\n\nPrincipal cells: columnar
    cells that, with the basal cells, form the majority of the epithelium. \n\nIn
    the caput (head) region these cells have long stereocilia that are tuft-like
    extensions that project into the lumen. \n\nThe sterocilia are much shorter in
    the cauda (tail) segment. \n\nThey also secrete carnitine, sialic acid, glycoproteins,
    and glycerylphosphorylcholine into the lumen.\nBasal cells: shorter, pyramid-shaped
    cells which contact the basal lamina but taper off before their apical surfaces
    reach the lumen. \n\nThese are thought to be undifferentiated precursors of principal
    cells.\nApical cells: predominantly found in the head region\nClear cells: predominant
    in the tail region\nIntraepithelial lymphocytes: distributed throughout the tissue.\nIntraepithelial
    macrophages\n\n\n==== Stereocilia ====\nThe stereocilia of the epididymis are
    long cytoplasmic projections that have an actin filament backbone. \n\nThese
    filaments have been visualized at high resolution using fluorescent phalloidin
    that binds to actin filaments.\nThe stereocilia in the epididymis are non-motile.
    \n\nThese membrane extensions increase the surface area of the cell, allowing
    for greater absorption and secretion. \n\nIt has been shown that epithelial sodium
    channel ENaC that allows the flow of Na+ ions into the cell is localized on stereocilia.Because
    sperm are initially non-motile as they leave the seminiferous tubules, large
    volumes of fluid are secreted to propel them to the epididymis. \n\nThe core
    function of the stereocilia is to resorb 90% of this fluid as the spermatozoa
    start to become motile. \n\nThis absorption creates a fluid current that moves
    the immobile sperm from the seminiferous tubules to the epididymis. \n\nSpermatozoa
    do not reach full motility until they reach the vagina, where the alkaline pH
    is neutralized by acidic vaginal fluids.\n\n\n=== Development ===\n\nIn the embryo,
    the epididymis develops from tissue that once formed the mesonephros, a primitive
    kidney found in many aquatic vertebrates. \n\nPersistence of the cranial end
    of the mesonephric duct will leave behind a remnant called the appendix of the
    epididymis. \n\nIn addition, some mesonephric tubules can persist as the paradidymis,
    a small body caudal to the efferent ductules.\nA Gartner's duct is a homologous
    remnant in the female.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\n\n\n=== Role in storage of sperm
    and ejaculant ===\n\nSpermatozoa formed in the testis enter the caput epididymis,
    progress to the corpus, and finally reach the cauda region, where they are stored.
    \n\nSperm entering the caput epididymis are incomplete\u2014they lack the ability
    to swim forward (motility) and to fertilize an egg. \n\nEpididymal transit takes
    2 to 6 days in humans and 10\u201313 in rodents. \n\nDuring their transit in
    the epididymis, sperm undergo maturation processes necessary for them to acquire
    motility and fertility. \n\nFinal maturation (capacitation) is completed in the
    female reproductive tract.\nThe epididymis secretes immobilin, a large glycoprotein
    that is responsible for the creating of the viscoelastic luminal environment
    that serves to mechanically immobilize spermatozoa until ejaculation. \n\nImmobilin
    is predominantly secreted into the proximal caput epididymis prior to the acquisition
    of the potential for sperm motility. \n\nDuring ejaculation, sperm flow from
    the cauda epididymis (which functions as a storage reservoir) into the vas deferens
    where they are propelled by the peristaltic action of muscle layers in the wall
    of the vas deferens, and are mixed with the diluting fluids of the prostate,
    seminal vesicles, and other accessory glands prior to ejaculation (forming semen).\n\n\n==
    Clinical significance ==\n\n\n\n=== Inflammation ===\n\nAn inflammation of the
    epididymis is called epididymitis. \n\nIt is much more common than testicular
    inflammation, termed orchitis.\n\n\n=== Surgical removal ===\n\nEpididymotomy
    is the placing of an incision into the epididymis and is sometimes considered
    as a treatment option for acute suppurating epididymitis.\nEpididymectomy is
    the surgical removal of the epididymis sometimes performed for post-vasectomy
    pain syndrome and for refractory cases of epididymitis.\nEpididymectomy is also
    performed for sterilization on some male animals of livestock species so they
    can be used to detect estrus in females ready for artificially insemination.\n\n\n==

    (right superior lobar bronchus) is a branch of the right main bronchus given
    off about 2.5 cm from the bifurcation of the trachea.\n\nThis branch supplies
    the superior lobe of the right lung and is the most superior of all secondary
    bronchi. \n\nIt arises above the level of the right pulmonary artery, and for
    this reason is named the eparterial bronchus.\n\nAll other distributions falling
    below the pulmonary artery are termed hyparterial.\n\nThe eparterial bronchus
    is the only secondary bronchus with a specific name apart from the name of its
    corresponding lobe. \n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eparterial_bronchus"

    bounded laterally by the bone of the mandible and inferolaterally by the mylohyoid
    muscle. \n\nThe glands can be felt behind each mandibular canine. \n\nPlacing
    one index finger within the mouth and the fingertips of the opposite hand outside
    it, the compressed gland is manually palpated between the inner and outer fingers.\nThe
    sublingual glands are drained by 8-20 excretory ducts called the ducts of Rivinus.
    \n\nThe largest of all, the sublingual duct (of Bartholin) joins the submandibular
    duct to drain through the sublingual caruncle. \n\nThe sublingual caruncle is
    a small papilla near the midline of the floor of the mouth on each side of the
    lingual frenum. \n\nMost of the remaining small sublingual ducts (of Rivinus)
    open separate into the mouth on an elevated crest of mucous membrane, the plica
    sublingualis (aka sublingual fold), formed by the gland and located on either
    side of the frenulum linguae. \n\n\n=== Microanatomy ===\n\nThe sublingual gland
    consists mostly of mucous acini capped with serous demilunes and is therefore
    categorized as a mixed mucous gland with a mucous product predominating. \n\nStriated
    and intercalated ducts are also present.\n\n\n=== Blood supply ===\n\nThe gland
    receives its blood supply from the sublingual and submental arteries. \n\nLymph
    from the sublingual salivary gland drains into the submandibular lymph nodes.\n\n\n===
    Nerve supply ===\n\nThe chorda tympani nerve (from the facial nerve via the submandibular
    ganglion) is secretomotor and provides parasympathetic supply to the sublingual
    glands. \n\nThe path of the nerve is as follows: junction between pons and medulla,
    through internal acoustic meatus and facial canal to chorda tympani, through
    middle ear cavity, out petrotympanic fissure to join the lingual nerve, travels
    with lingual nerve to synapse at the submandibular ganglion, then postganglionic
    fibers travels to the sublingual gland.\n\n\n=== Development ===\n\nThe sublingual
    salivary glands appear in the eighth week of prenatal development, two weeks
    later than the other two major salivary glands. \n\nThey develop from epithelial
    buds in the sulcus surrounding the sublingual folds on the floor of the mouth,
    lateral to the developing submandibular gland. \n\nThese buds branch and form
    into cords that canalize to form the sublingual ducts associated with the gland.
    \n\nThe rounded terminal ends of the cords form acini.\n\n\n== Clinical significance
    ==\n\n\nRanulas are the most common pathologic lesion associated with the sublingual
    glands.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sublingual_gland"

  descriptionText: "\n\nPROSTATE\n\n\nThe prostate is both an accessory gland of
    the male reproductive system and a muscle-driven mechanical switch between urination
    and ejaculation. \n\nIt is found only in some mammals. \n\nIt differs between
    species anatomically, chemically, and physiologically. \n\nAnatomically, the
    prostate is found below the bladder, with the urethra passing through it. \n\nIt
    is described in gross anatomy as consisting of lobes and in microanatomy by zone.
    \n\nIt is surrounded by an elastic, fibromuscular capsule and contains glandular
    tissue as well as connective tissue.\nThe prostate glands produce and contain
    fluid that forms part of semen, the substance that is emitted during ejaculation
    as part of the male sexual response. \n\nThis prostatic fluid is slightly alkaline,
    milky or white in appearance. \n\nThe alkalinity of semen helps neutralize the
    acidity of the vaginal tract, prolonging the lifespan of sperm. \n\nThe prostatic
    fluid is expelled in the first part of ejaculate, together with most of the sperm,
    because of the action of smooth muscle tissue within the prostate. \n\nIn comparison
    with the few spermatozoa expelled together with mainly seminal vesicular fluid,
    those in prostatic fluid have better motility, longer survival, and better protection
    of genetic material.\nDisorders of the prostate include enlargement, inflammation,
    infection, and cancer. \n\nThe word prostate comes from Ancient Greek \u03C0\u03C1\u03BF\u03C3\u03C4\u03AC\u03C4\u03B7\u03C2,
    prost\xE1t\u0113s, meaning \"one who stands before\", \"protector\", \"guardian\",
    with the term originally used to describe the seminal vesicles.\n\n\n== Structure
    ==\n\nThe prostate is a gland of the male reproductive system. \n\nIn adults,
    it is about the size of a walnut, and has an average weight of about 11 grams,
    usually ranging between 7 and 16 grams. \n\nThe prostate is located in the pelvis.
    \n\nIt sits below the urinary bladder and surrounds the urethra. \n\nThe part
    of the urethra passing through it is called the prostatic urethra, which joins
    with the two ejaculatory ducts. \n\nThe prostate is covered in a surface called
    the prostatic capsule or prostatic fascia.The internal structure of the prostate
    has been described using both lobes and zones. \n\nBecause of the variation in
    descriptions and definitions of lobes, the zone classification is used more predominantly.The
    prostate has been described as consisting of three or four zones. \n\nZones are
    more typically able to be seen on histology, or in medical imaging, such as ultrasound
    or MRI. \n\nThe zones are:\n\nThe \"lobe\" classification describes lobes that,
    while originally defined in the fetus, are also visible in gross anatomy, including
    dissection and when viewed endoscopically. \n\nThe five lobes are the anterior
    lobe or isthmus, the posterior lobe, the right and left lateral lobes, and the
    middle or median lobe.\n\t\t\nInside of the prostate, adjacent and parallel to
    the prostatic urethra, there are two longitudinal muscle systems. \n\nOn the
    front side (ventrally) runs the urethral dilator (musculus dilatator urethrae),
    on the backside (dorsally) runs the muscle switching the urethra into the ejaculatory
    state (musculus ejaculatorius).\n\n\n=== Blood and lymphatic vessels ===\n\nThe
    prostate receives blood through the inferior vesical artery, internal pudendal
    artery, and middle rectal arteries. \n\nThese vessels enter the prostate on its
    outer posterior surface where it meets the bladder, and travel forward to the
    apex of the prostate. \n\nBoth the inferior vesical and the middle rectal arteries
    often arise together directly from the internal iliac arteries. \n\nOn entering
    the bladder, the inferior vesical artery splits into a urethral branch, supplying
    the urethral prostate; and a capsular branch, which travels around the capsule
    and has smaller branches which perforate into the prostate.The veins of the prostate
    form a network \u2013 the prostatic venous plexus, primarily around its front
    and outer surface. \n\nThis network also receives blood from the deep dorsal
    vein of the penis, and is connected via branches to the vesical plexus and internal
    pudendal veins. \n\nVeins drain into the vesical and then internal iliac veins.The
    lymphatic drainage of the prostate depends on the positioning of the area. \n\nVessels
    surrounding the vas deferens, some of the vessels in the seminal vesicle, and
    a vessel from the posterior surface of the prostate drain into the external iliac
    lymph nodes. \n\nSome of the seminal vesicle vessels, prostatic vessels, and
    vessels from the anterior prostate drain into internal iliac lymph nodes. \n\nVessels
    of the prostate itself also drain into the obturator and sacral lymph nodes.\n\n\t\t\n\n\n===
    Microanatomy ===\n\n\nThe prostate consists of glandular and connective tissue.
    \n\nTall column-shaped cells form the lining (the epithelium) of the glands.
    \n\nThese form one layer or may be pseudostratified. \n\nThe epithelium is highly
    variable and areas of low cuboidal or flat cells can also be present, with transitional
    epithelium in the outer regions of the longer ducts. \n\nThe glands are formed
    as many follicles, which in drain into canals and subsequently 12\u201320 main
    ducts, These in turn drain into the urethra as it passes through the prostate.
    \n\nThere are also a small amount of flat cells, which sit next to the basement
    membranes of glands, and act as stem cells.The connective tissue of the prostate
    is made up of fibrous tissue and smooth muscle. \n\nThe fibrous tissue separates
    the gland into lobules. \n\nIt also sits between the glands and is composed of
    randomly orientated smooth-muscle bundles that are continuous with the bladder.Over
    time, thickened secretions called corpora amylacea accumulate in the gland.\n\n\n===
    Gene and protein expression ===\n\n\nAbout 20,000 protein coding genes are expressed
    in human cells and almost 75% of these genes are expressed in the normal prostate.
    \n\nAbout 150 of these genes are more specifically expressed in the prostate,
    with about 20 genes being highly prostate specific. \n\nThe corresponding specific
    proteins are expressed in the glandular and secretory cells of the prostatic
    gland and have functions that are important for the characteristics of semen,
    including prostate-specific proteins, such as the prostate specific antigen (PSA),
    and the Prostatic acid phosphatase.\n\n\n=== Development ===\n\n\nIn the developing
    embryo, at the hind end lies an inpouching called the cloaca. \n\nThis, over
    the fourth to the seventh week, divides into a urogenital sinus and the beginnings
    of the anal canal, with a wall forming between these two inpouchings called the
    urorectal septum. \n\nThe urogenital sinus divides into three parts, with the
    middle part forming the urethra; the upper part is largest and becomes the urinary
    bladder, and the lower part then changes depending on the biological sex of the
    embryo.The prostatic part of the urethra develops from the middle, pelvic, part
    of the urogenital sinus, which is of endodermal origin. \n\nAround the end of
    the third month of embryonic life, outgrowths arise from the prostatic part of
    the urethra and grow into the surrounding mesenchyme. \n\nThe cells lining this
    part of the urethra differentiate into the glandular epithelium of the prostate.
    \n\nThe associated mesenchyme differentiates into the dense connective tissue
    and the smooth muscle of the prostate.Condensation of mesenchyme, urethra, and
    Wolffian ducts gives rise to the adult prostate gland, a composite organ made
    up of several tightly fused glandular and non-glandular components. \n\nTo function
    properly, the prostate needs male hormones (androgens), which are responsible
    for male sex characteristics. \n\nThe main male hormone is testosterone, which
    is produced mainly by the testicles. \n\nIt is dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a metabolite
    of testosterone, that predominantly regulates the prostate. \n\nThe prostate
    gland enlarges over time, until the fourth decade of life.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\nThe
    prostate secretes fluid which becomes part of semen. \n\nSemen is the fluid emitted
    (ejaculated) by males during the sexual response. \n\nWhen sperm is emitted,
    it is transmitted from the vas deferens into the male urethra via the ejaculatory
    ducts, which lie within the prostate gland. \n\nEjaculation is the expulsion
    of semen from the urethra. \n\nSemen is moved into the urethra following contractions
    of the smooth muscle of the vas deferens and seminal vesicles, following stimulation,
    primarily of the glans penis. \n\nStimulation sends nerve signals via the internal
    pudendal nerves to the upper lumbar spine; the nerve signals causing contraction
    act via the hypogastric nerves. \n\nAfter traveling into the urethra, the seminal
    fluid is ejaculated by contraction of the bulbocavernosus muscle. \n\nThe secretions
    of the prostate include proteolytic enzymes, prostatic acid phosphatase, fibrinolysin,
    zinc, and prostate-specific antigen. \n\nTogether with the secretions from the
    seminal vesicles, these form the major fluid part of semen.It is possible for
    some men to achieve orgasm solely through stimulation of the prostate gland,
    such as via prostate massage or anal intercourse. \n\nThis has led to the area
    of the rectal wall adjacent to the prostate to be popularly (yet inaccurately)
    referred to as the \"male G-spot\".The prostate's changes of shape, which facilitate
    the mechanical switch between urination and ejaculation, are mainly driven by
    the two longitudinal muscle systems running along the prostatic urethra. \n\nThese
    are the urethral dilator (musculus dilatator urethrae) on the urethra's front
    side, which contracts during urination and thereby shortens and tilts the prostate
    in its vertical dimension thus widening the prostatic section of the urethral
    tube, and the muscle switching the urethra into the ejaculatory state (musculus
    ejaculatorius) on its backside.In case of an operation, e.g. because of benign
    prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), damaging or sparing of these two muscle systems
    varies considerably depending on the choice of operation type and details of
    the procedure of the chosen technique. \n\nThe effects on postoperational urination
    and ejaculation vary correspondingly. (See also: Surgery for benign prostatic
    hyperplasia).\n\n\n== Clinical significance ==\n\n\n\n=== Inflammation ===\n\n\nProstatitis
    is inflammation of the prostate gland. \n\nIt can be caused by infection with
    bacteria, or other noninfective causes. \n\nInflammation of the prostate can
    cause painful urination or ejaculation, groin pain, difficulty passing urine,
    or constitutional symptoms such as fever or tiredness. \n\nWhen inflamed, the
    prostate becomes enlarged and is tender when touched during digital rectal examination.
    \n\nA culprit bacteria may grow in a urine culture.Acute prostatitis and chronic
    bacterial prostatitis are treated with antibiotics. \n\nChronic non-bacterial
    prostatitis, or male chronic pelvic pain syndrome is treated by a large variety
    of modalities including the medications alpha blockers, nonsteroidal antiinflammatories
    and amitriptyline, antihistamines, and other anxiolytics. \n\nOther treatments
    that are not medications may include physical therapy, psychotherapy, nerve modulators,
    and surgery. \n\nMore recently, a combination of trigger point and psychological
    therapy has proved effective for category III prostatitis as well.\n\n\n=== Enlarged
    prostate ===\n\n\nAn enlarged prostate is called prostatomegaly, with benign
    prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) being the most common cause. \n\nBPH refers to an
    enlargement of the prostate due to an increase in the number of cells that make
    up the prostate (hyperplasia) from a cause that is not a malignancy. \n\nIt is
    very common in older men. \n\nIt is often diagnosed when the prostate has enlarged
    to the point where urination becomes difficult. \n\nSymptoms include needing
    to urinate often (urinary frequency) or taking a while to get started (urinary
    hesitancy). \n\nIf the prostate grows too large, it may constrict the urethra
    and impede the flow of urine, making urination painful and difficult, or in extreme
    cases completely impossible, causing urinary retention. \n\nOver time, chronic
    retention may cause the bladder to become larger and cause a backflow of urine
    into the kidneys (hydronephrosis).BPH can be treated with medication, a minimally
    invasive procedure or, in extreme cases, surgery that removes the prostate. \n\nIn
    general, treatment often begins with an alpha-1 adrenergic receptor antagonist
    medication such as tamsulosin, which reduces the tone of the smooth muscle found
    in the urethra that passes through the prostate, making it easier for urine to
    pass through. \n\nFor people with persistent symptoms, procedures may be considered.
    \n\nThe surgery most often used in such cases is transurethral resection of the
    prostate, in which an instrument is inserted through the urethra to remove prostate
    tissue that is pressing against the upper part of the urethra and restricting
    the flow of urine. \n\nMinimally invasive procedures include transurethral needle
    ablation of the prostate and transurethral microwave thermotherapy. \n\nThese
    outpatient procedures may be followed by the insertion of a temporary stent,
    to allow normal voluntary urination, without exacerbating irritative symptoms.\n\n\n===
    Cancer ===\n\n\nProstate cancer is one of the most common cancers affecting older
    men in the UK, US, Northern Europe and Australia, and a significant cause of
    death for elderly men worldwide. \n\nOften, a person does not have symptoms;
    when they do occur, symptoms may include urinary frequency, urgency, hesitation
    and other symptoms associated with BPH. \n\nUncommonly, such cancers may cause
    weight loss, retention of urine, or symptoms such as back pain due to metastatic
    lesions that have spread outside of the prostate.A digital rectal examination
    and the measurement of a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level are usually the
    first investigations done to check for prostate cancer. \n\nPSA values are difficult
    to interpret, because a high value might be present in a person without cancer,
    and a low value can be present in someone with cancer. \n\nThe next form of testing
    is often the taking of a biopsy to assess for tumour activity and invasiveness.
    \n\nBecause of the significant risk of overdiagnosis with widespread screening
    in the general population, prostate cancer screening is controversial. \n\nIf
    a tumour is confirmed, medical imaging such as an MRI or bone scan may be done
    to check for the presence of tumour metastases in other parts of the body.Prostate
    cancer that is only present in the prostate is often treated with either surgical
    removal of the prostate or with radiotherapy or by the insertion of small radioactive
    particles of iodine-125 or palladium-103, called brachytherapy. \n\nCancer that
    has spread to other parts of the body is usually treated also with hormone therapy,
    to deprive a tumour of sex hormones (androgens) that stimulate proliferation.
    \n\nThis is often done through the use of GnRH analogues or agents that block
    the receptors that androgens act at, such as bicalutamide; occasionally, surgical
    removal of the testes may be done instead. \n\nCancer that does not respond to
    hormonal treatment, or that progresses after treatment, might be treated with
    chemotherapy such as docetaxel. \n\nRadiotherapy may also be used to help with
    pain associated with bony lesions.Sometimes, the decision may be made not to
    treat prostate cancer. \n\nIf a cancer is small and localised, the decision may
    be made to monitor for cancer activity at intervals (\"active surveillance\")
    and defer treatment. \n\nIf a person, because of frailty or other medical conditions
    or reasons, has a life expectancy less than ten years, then the impacts of treatment
    may outweigh any perceived benefits.\n\n\n=== Surgery ===\n\n\nSurgery to remove
    the prostate is called prostatectomy, and is usually done as a treatment for
    cancer limited to the prostate, or prostatic enlargement. \n\nWhen it is done,
    it may be done as open surgery or as laparoscopic (keyhole) surgery. \n\nThese
    are done under general anaesthetic. \n\nUsually the procedure for cancer is a
    radical prostatectomy, which means that the seminal vesicles are removed and
    vas deferens is also tied off. \n\nPart of the prostate can also be removed from
    within the urethra, called transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). \n\nOpen
    surgery may involve a cut that is made in the perineum, or via an approach that
    involves a cut down the midline from the belly button to the pubic bone. \n\nOpen
    surgery may be preferred if there is a suspicion that lymph nodes are involved
    and they need to be removed or biopsied during a procedure. \n\nA perineal approach
    will not involve lymph node removal and may result in less pain and a faster
    recovery following an operation. \n\nA TURP procedure uses a tube inserted into
    the urethra via the penis and some form of heat, electricity or laser to remove
    prostate tissue.The whole prostate can be removed. \n\nComplications that might
    develop because of surgery include urinary incontinence. \n\nErectile dysfunction
    because of damage to nerves during the operation, particularly if a cancer is
    very close to nerves. \n\nEjaculation of semen will not occur during orgasm if
    the vas deferens are tied off and seminal vesicles removed, such as during a
    radial prosatectomy. \n\nThis will mean a man becomes infertile. \n\nSometimes,
    orgasm may not be able to occur or may be painful. \n\nThe penis length may change
    if the part of the urethra within the prostate is also removed. \n\nGeneral complications
    due to surgery can also develop, such as infections, bleeding, inadvertent damage
    to nearby organs or within the abdomen, and the formation of blood clots.\n\n\n==
    History ==\n\nThe prostate was first formally identified by Venetian anatomist
    Niccol\xF2 Massa in Anatomiae libri introductorius (Introduction to Anatomy)
    1536 and illustrated by Flemish anatomist Andreas Vesalius in Tabulae anatomicae
    sex (six anatomical tables) in 1538. \n\nMassa described it as a \"glandular
    flesh upon which rests the neck of the bladder,\" and Vesalius as a \"glandular
    body\". \n\nThe first time a word similar to 'prostate' was used to describe
    the gland is credited to Andr\xE9 du Laurens in 1600, who described it as a term
    already in use by anatomists at the time. \n\nThe term was however used at least
    as early as 1549 by French surgeon Ambroise Pare.At the time, Du Laurens was
    describing what was considered to be a pair of organs (not the single two-lobed
    organ), and the Latin term prostatae that was used was a mistranslation of the
    term for the Ancient Greek word used to describe the seminal vesicles, parastatai;
    although it has been argued that surgeons in Ancient Greece and Rome must have
    at least seen the prostate as an anatomical entity. \n\nThe term prostatae was
    taken rather than the grammatically correct prostator (singular) and prostatores
    (plural) because the gender of the Ancient Greek term was taken as female, when
    it was in fact male.The fact that the prostate was one and not two organs was
    an idea popularised throughout the early 18th century, as was the English language
    term used to describe the organ, prostate, attributed to William Cheselden. \n\nA
    monograph, \"Practical observations on the treatment of the diseases of the prostate
    gland\" by Everard Home in 1811, was important in the history of the prostate
    by describing and naming anatomical parts of the prostate, including the median
    lobe. \n\nThe idea of the five lobes of the prostate was popularized following
    anatomical studies conducted by American urologist Oswald Lowsley in 1912. \n\nJohn
    E. \n\nMcNeal first proposed the idea of \"zones\" in 1968; McNeal found that
    the relatively homogeneous cut surface of an adult prostate in no way resembled
    \"lobes\" and thus led to the description of \"zones\".Prostate cancer was first
    described in a speech to the Medical and Chiurgical Society of London in 1853
    by surgeon John Adams and increasingly described by the late 19th century. \n\nProstate
    cancer was initially considered a rare disease, probably because of shorter life
    expectancies and poorer detection methods in the 19th century. \n\nThe first
    treatments of prostate cancer were surgeries to relieve urinary obstruction.
    \n\nSamuel David Gross has been credited with the first mention of a prostatectomy,
    as \"too absurd to be seriously entertained\" The first removal for prostate
    cancer (radical perineal prostatectomy) was first performed in 1904 by Hugh H.
    \n\nYoung at Johns Hopkins Hospital; partial removal of the gland was conducted
    by Theodore Billroth in 1867.Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) replaced
    radical prostatectomy for symptomatic relief of obstruction in the middle of
    the 20th century because it could better preserve penile erectile function. \n\nRadical
    retropubic prostatectomy was developed in 1983 by Patrick Walsh. \n\nIn 1941,
    Charles B. \n\nHuggins published studies in which he used estrogen to oppose
    testosterone production in men with metastatic prostate cancer. \n\nThis discovery
    of \"chemical castration\" won Huggins the 1966 Nobel Prize in Physiology or
    Medicine.The role of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) in reproduction
    was determined by Andrzej W. \n\nSchally and Roger Guillemin, who both won the
    1977 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for this work. \n\nGnRH receptor agonists,
    such as leuprorelin and goserelin, were subsequently developed and used to treat
    prostate cancer. \n\nRadiation therapy for prostate cancer was first developed
    in the early 20th century and initially consisted of intraprostatic radium implants.
    \n\nExternal beam radiotherapy became more popular as stronger X-ray radiation
    sources became available in the middle of the 20th century. \n\nBrachytherapy
    with implanted seeds (for prostate cancer) was first described in 1983. \n\nSystemic
    chemotherapy for prostate cancer was first studied in the 1970s. \n\nThe initial
    regimen of cyclophosphamide and 5-fluorouracil was quickly joined by multiple
    regimens using a host of other systemic chemotherapy drugs.\n\n\n== Other animals
    ==\n\nThe prostate is found only in mammals. \n\nThe prostate glands of male
    marsupials are proportionally larger than those of placental mammals. \n\nThe
    presence of a functional prostate in monotremes is controversial, and if monotremes
    do possess functional prostates, they may not make the same contribution to semen
    as in other mammals.The structure of the prostate varies, ranging from tubuloalveolar
    (as in humans) to branched tubular. \n\nThe gland is particularly well developed
    in dogs, foxes and boars, though in other mammals, such as bulls, it can be small
    and inconspicuous. \n\nIn other animals, such as marsupials and small ruminants,
    the prostate is disseminate, meaning not specifically localisable as a distinct
    tissue, but present throughout the relevant part of the urethra; in other animals,
    such as red deer and American elk, it may be present as a specific organ and
    in a disseminate form. \n\nIn some marsupial species, the size of the prostate
    gland changes seasonally. \n\nThe prostate is the only accessory gland that occurs
    in male dogs. \n\nDogs can produce in one hour as much prostatic fluid as a human
    can in a day. \n\nThey excrete this fluid along with their urine to mark their
    territory. \n\nAdditionally, dogs are the only species apart from humans seen
    to have a significant incidence of prostate cancer. \n\nIn cetaceans (whales,
    dolphins, porpoises) the prostate is composed of diffuse urethral glands and
    is surrounded by a very powerful compressor muscle.The prostate gland originates
    with tissues in the urethral wall. \n\nThis means the urethra, a compressible
    tube used for urination, runs through the middle of the prostate. \n\nThis leads
    to an evolutionary design fault for some mammals, including human males. \n\nThe
    prostate is prone to infection and enlargement later in life, constricting the
    urethra so urinating becomes slow and painful.Prostatic secretions vary among
    species. \n\nThey are generally composed of simple sugars and are often slightly
    alkaline.\n\n\n== Skene's gland ==\n\nBecause the Skene's gland and the male
    prostate act similarly by secreting prostate-specific antigen (PSA), which is
    an ejaculate protein produced in males, and of prostate-specific acid phosphatase,
    the Skene's glands is sometimes referred to as the \"female prostate\". \n\nAlthough
    it is homologous to the male prostate (developed from the same embryological
    tissues), various aspects of its development in relation to the male prostate
    are widely unknown and a matter of research.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"

  descriptionText: "\n\nGALLBLADDER\n\n\nIn vertebrates, the gallbladder, also known
    as the cholecyst, is a small hollow organ where bile is stored and concentrated
    before it is released into the small intestine. \n\nIn humans, the pear-shaped
    gallbladder lies beneath the liver, although the structure and position of the
    gallbladder can vary significantly among animal species. \n\nIt receives and
    stores bile, produced by the liver, via the common hepatic duct, and releases
    it via the common bile duct into the duodenum, where the bile helps in the digestion
    of fats.\n\nThe gallbladder can be affected by gallstones, formed by material
    that cannot be dissolved \u2013 usually cholesterol or bilirubin, a product of
    haemoglobin breakdown. \n\nThese may cause significant pain, particularly in
    the upper-right corner of the abdomen, and are often treated with removal of
    the gallbladder called a cholecystectomy. \n\nCholecystitis, inflammation of
    the gallbladder, has a wide range of causes, including result from the impaction
    of gallstones, infection, and autoimmune disease.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe
    gallbladder is a hollow organ that sits in a shallow depression below the right
    lobe of the liver, which is grey-blue in life. \n\nIn adults, the gallbladder
    measures approximately 7 to 10 centimetres (2.8 to 3.9 inches) in length and
    4 centimetres (1.6 in) in diameter when fully distended. \n\nThe gallbladder
    has a capacity of about 50 millilitres (1.8 imperial fluid ounces).\n\nThe gallbladder
    is shaped like a pear, with its tip opening into the cystic duct. \n\nThe gallbladder
    is divided into three sections: the fundus, body, and neck. \n\nThe fundus is
    the rounded base, angled so that it faces the abdominal wall. \n\nThe body lies
    in a depression in the surface of the lower liver. \n\nThe neck tapers and is
    continuous with the cystic duct, part of the biliary tree. \n\nThe gallbladder
    fossa, against which the fundus and body of the gallbladder lie, is found beneath
    the junction of hepatic segments IVB and V. \n\nThe cystic duct unites with the
    common hepatic duct to become the common bile duct. \n\nAt the junction of the
    neck of the gallbladder and the cystic duct, there is an out-pouching of the
    gallbladder wall forming a mucosal fold known as \"Hartmann's pouch\".Lymphatic
    drainage of the gallbladder follows the cystic node which is located between
    cystic duct and common hepatic ducts. \n\nLymphatics from the lower part of the
    drain into lower hepatic lymph nodes. \n\nAll the lymph finally drains into celiac
    lymph nodes.\n\n\n=== Microanatomy ===\n\n\nThe gallbladder wall is composed
    of a number of layers. \n\nThe gallbladder wall's innermost surface is lined
    by a single layer of columnar cells with a brush border of microvilli, very similar
    to intestinal absorptive cells. \n\nUnderneath the epithelium is an underlying
    lamina propria, a muscular layer, an outer perimuscular layer and serosa. \n\nUnlike
    elsewhere in the intestinal tract, the gallbladder does not have a muscularis
    mucosae, and the muscular fibres are not arranged in distinct layers.\n\nThe
    mucosa, the inner portion of the gallbladder wall, consists of a lining of a
    single layer of columnar cells, with cells possessing small hair-like attachments
    called microvilli. \n\nThis sits on a thin layer of connective tissue, the lamina
    propria. \n\nThe mucosa is curved and collected into tiny outpouchings called
    rugae.A muscular layer sits beneath the mucosa. \n\nThis is formed by smooth
    muscle, with fibres that lie in longitudinal, oblique and transverse directions,
    and are not arranged in separate layers. \n\nThe muscle fibres here contract
    to expel bile from the gallbladder. \n\nA distinctive feature of the gallbladder
    is the presence of Rokitansky\u2013Aschoff sinuses, deep outpouchings of the
    mucosa that can extend through the muscular layer, and which indicate adenomyomatosis.
    \n\nThe muscular layer is surrounded by a layer of connective and fat tissue.The
    outer layer of the fundus of gallbladder, and the surfaces not in contact with
    the liver, are covered by a thick serosa, which is exposed to the peritoneum.
    \n\nThe serosa contains blood vessels and lymphatics. \n\nThe surfaces in contact
    with the liver are covered in connective tissue.\n\n\n=== Variation ===\n\n\nThe
    gallbladder varies in size, shape, and position between different people. \n\nRarely,
    two or even three gallbladders may coexist, either as separate bladders draining
    into the cystic duct, or sharing a common branch that drains into the cystic
    duct. \n\nAdditionally, the gallbladder may fail to form at all. \n\nGallbladders
    with two lobes separated by a septum may also exist. \n\nThese abnormalities
    are not likely to affect function and are generally asymptomatic.\n\nThe location
    of the gallbladder in relation to the liver may also vary, with documented variants
    including gallbladders found within, above, on the left side of, behind, and
    detached or suspended from the liver. \n\nSuch variants are very rare: from 1886
    to 1998, only 110 cases of left-lying liver, or less than one per year, were
    reported in scientific literature.An anatomical variation can occur, known as
    a Phrygian cap, which is an innocuous fold in the fundus, named after its resemblance
    to the Phrygian cap.\n\n\n=== Development ===\n\nThe gallbladder develops from
    an endodermal outpouching of the embryonic gut tube. \n\nEarly in development,
    the human embryo has three germ layers and abuts an embryonic yolk sac. \n\nDuring
    the second week of embryogenesis, as the embryo grows, it begins to surround
    and envelop portions of this sac. \n\nThe enveloped portions form the basis for
    the adult gastrointestinal tract. \n\nSections of this foregut begin to differentiate
    into the organs of the gastrointestinal tract, such as the esophagus, stomach,
    and intestines.During the fourth week of embryological development, the stomach
    rotates. \n\nThe stomach, originally lying in the midline of the embryo, rotates
    so that its body is on the left. \n\nThis rotation also affects the part of the
    gastrointestinal tube immediately below the stomach, which will go on to become
    the duodenum. \n\nBy the end of the fourth week, the developing duodenum begins
    to spout a small outpouching on its right side, the hepatic diverticulum, which
    will go on to become the biliary tree. \n\nJust below this is a second outpouching,
    known as the cystic diverticulum, that will eventually develop into the gallbladder.\n\n\n==
    Function ==\n\n\nThe main function of the gallbladder is to store bile, also
    called gall, needed for the digestion of fats in food. \n\nProduced by the liver,
    bile flows through small vessels into the larger hepatic ducts and ultimately
    through the cystic duct (parts of the biliary tree) into the gallbladder, where
    it is stored. \n\nAt any one time, 30 to 60 millilitres (1.0 to 2.0 US fl oz)
    of bile is stored within the gallbladder.When food containing fat enters the
    digestive tract, it stimulates the secretion of cholecystokinin (CCK) from I
    cells of the duodenum and jejunum. \n\nIn response to cholecystokinin, the gallbladder
    rhythmically contracts and releases its contents into the common bile duct, eventually
    draining into the duodenum. \n\nThe bile emulsifies fats in partly digested food,
    thereby assisting their absorption. \n\nBile consists primarily of water and
    bile salts, and also acts as a means of eliminating bilirubin, a product of hemoglobin
    metabolism, from the body.\n\nThe bile that is secreted by the liver and stored
    in the gallbladder is not the same as the bile that is secreted by the gallbladder.
    \n\nDuring gallbladder storage of bile, it is concentrated 3-10 fold by removal
    of some water and electrolytes. \n\nThis is through the active transport of sodium
    and chloride ions across the epithelium of the gallbladder, which creates an
    osmotic pressure that also causes water and other electrolytes to be reabsorbed.\n\n\n==
    Clinical significance ==\n\n\n=== Gallstones ===\n\n\nGallstones form when the
    bile is saturated, usually with either cholesterol or bilirubin. \n\nMost gallstones
    do not cause symptoms, with stones either remaining in the gallbladder or passed
    along the biliary system. \n\nWhen symptoms occur, severe \"colicky\" pain in
    the upper right part of the abdomen is often felt. \n\nIf the stone blocks the
    gallbladder, inflammation known as cholecystitis may result. \n\nIf the stone
    lodges in the biliary system, jaundice may occur; if the stone blocks the pancreatic
    duct, pancreatitis may occur. \n\nGallstones are diagnosed using ultrasound.
    \n\nWhen a symptomatic gallstone occurs, it is often managed by waiting for it
    to be passed naturally. \n\nGiven the likelihood of recurrent gallstones, surgery
    to remove the gallbladder is often considered. \n\nSome medication, such as ursodeoxycholic
    acid, may be used; lithotripsy, a procedure used to break down the stones, may
    also be used.\n\n\n=== Inflammation ===\n\n\nKnown as cholecystitis, inflammation
    of the gallbladder is commonly caused by obstruction of the duct with gallstones,
    which is known as cholelithiasis. \n\nBlocked bile accumulates, and pressure
    on the gallbladder wall may lead to the release of substances that cause inflammation,
    such as phospholipase. \n\nThere is also the risk of bacterial infection. \n\nAn
    inflamed gallbladder is likely to cause sharp and localised pain, fever, and
    tenderness in the upper, right corner of the abdomen, and may have a positive
    Murphy's sign. \n\nCholecystitis is often managed with rest and antibiotics,
    particularly cephalosporins and, in severe cases, metronidazole. \n\nAdditionally
    the gallbladder may need to be removed surgically if inflammation has progressed
    far enough.\n\n\n=== Gallbladder removal ===\n\n\nA cholecystectomy is a procedure
    in which the gallbladder is removed. \n\nIt may be removed because of recurrent
    gallstones and is considered an elective procedure. \n\nA cholecystectomy may
    be an open procedure, or a laparoscopic one. \n\nIn the surgery, the gallbladder
    is removed from the neck to the fundus, and so bile will drain directly from
    the liver into the biliary tree. \n\nAbout 30 percent of patients may experience
    some degree of indigestion following the procedure, although severe complications
    are much rarer. \n\nAbout 10 percent of surgeries lead to a chronic condition
    of postcholecystectomy syndrome.\n\n\n=== Complication ===\n\n\nBiliary injury
    (bile duct injury) is the traumatic damage of the bile ducts. \n\nIt is most
    commonly an iatrogenic complication of cholecystectomy \u2014 surgical removal
    of gall bladder, but can also be caused by other operations or by major trauma.
    \n\nThe risk of biliary injury is more during laparoscopic cholecystectomy than
    during open cholecystectomy. \n\nBiliary injury may lead to several complications
    and may even cause death if not diagnosed in time and managed properly. \n\nIdeally
    biliary injury should be managed at a center with facilities and expertise in
    endoscopy, radiology and surgery.Biloma is collection of bile within the abdominal
    cavity. \n\nIt happens when there is a bile leak, for example after surgery for
    removing the gallbladder (laparoscopic cholecystectomy), with an incidence of
    0.3\u20132%. \n\nOther causes are biliary surgery, liver biopsy, abdominal trauma,
    and, rarely, spontaneous perforation.\n\n\n=== Cancer ===\n\n\nCancer of the
    gallbladder is uncommon and mostly occurs in later life. \n\nWhen cancer occurs,
    it is mostly of the glands lining the surface of the gallbladder (adenocarcinoma).
    \n\nGallstones are thought to be linked to the formation of cancer. \n\nOther
    risk factors include large (>1 cm) gallbladder polyps and having a highly calcified
    \"porcelain\" gallbladder.\n\nCancer of the gallbladder can cause attacks of
    biliary pain, yellowing of the skin (jaundice), and weight loss. \n\nA large
    gallbladder may be able to be felt in the abdomen. \n\nLiver function tests may
    be elevated, particularly involving GGT and ALP, with ultrasound and CT scans
    being considered medical imaging investigations of choice. \n\nCancer of the
    gallbladder is managed by removing the gallbladder, however, as of 2010, the
    prognosis remains poor.\n\nCancer of the gallbladder may also be found incidentally
    after surgical removal of the gallbladder, with 1\u20133% of cancers identified
    in this way. \n\nGallbladder polyps are mostly benign growths or lesions resembling
    growths that form in the gallbladder wall, and are only associated with cancer
    when they are larger in size (>1 cm). \n\nCholesterol polyps, often associated
    with cholesterolosis (\"strawberry gallbladder\", a change in the gallbladder
    wall due to excess cholesterol), often cause no symptoms and are thus often detected
    in this way.\n\n\n=== Tests ===\n\n\nTests used to investigate for gallbladder
    disease include blood tests and medical imaging. \n\nA full blood count may reveal
    an increased white cell count suggestive of inflammation or infection. \n\nTests
    such as bilirubin and liver function tests may reveal if there is inflammation
    linked to the biliary tree or gallbladder, and whether this is associated with
    inflammation of the liver, and a lipase or amylase may be elevated if there is
    pancreatitis. \n\nBilirubin may rise when there is obstruction of the flow of
    bile. \n\nA CA 19-9 level may be taken to investigate for cholangiocarcinoma.An
    ultrasound is often the first medical imaging test performed when gallbladder
    disease such as gallstones are suspected. \n\nAn abdominal X-ray or CT scan is
    another form of imaging that may be used to examine the gallbladder and surrounding
    organs. \n\nOther imaging options include MRCP (magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography),
    ERCP and percutaneous or intraoperative cholangiography. \n\nA cholescintigraphy
    scan is a nuclear imaging procedure used to assess the condition of the gallbladder.\n\n\n==
    Other animals ==\n\nMost vertebrates have gallbladders, but the form and arrangement
    of the bile ducts may vary considerably. \n\nIn many species, for example, there
    are several separate ducts running to the intestine, rather than the single common
    bile duct found in humans. \n\nSeveral species of mammals (including horses,
    deer, rats, and laminoids), several species of birds (such as pigeons and some
    psittacine species), lampreys and all invertebrates do not have a gallbladder
    .\n\nThe bile from several species of bears is used in traditional Chinese medicine;
    bile bears are kept alive in captivity while their bile is extracted, in an industry
    characterized by animal cruelty.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nDepictions of the gallbladder
    and biliary tree are found in Babylonian models found from 2000 BCE, and in ancient
    Etruscan model from 200 BCE, with models associated with divine worship.\n\nDiseases
    of the gallbladder are known to have existed in humans since antiquity, with
    gallstones found in the mummy of Princess Amenen of Thebes dating to 1500 BCE.
    \n\nSome historians believe the death of Alexander the Great may have been associated
    with an acute episode of cholecystitis. \n\nThe existence of the gallbladder
    has been noted since the 5th century, but it is only relatively recently that
    the function and the diseases of the gallbladder has been documented, particularly
    in the last two centuries.\n\nThe first descriptions of gallstones appear to
    have been in the Renaissance, perhaps because of the low incidence of gallstones
    in earlier times owing to a diet with more cereals and vegetables and less meat.
    \n\nAnthonius Benevinius in 1506 was the first to draw a connection between symptoms
    and the presence of gallstones. \n\nLudwig Georg Courvoisier, after examining
    a number of cases in 1890 that gave rise to the eponymous Courvoisier's law,
    stated that in an enlarged, nontender gallbladder, the cause of jaundice is unlikely
    to be gallstones.\n\nThe first surgical removal of a gallstone (cholecystolithotomy)
    was in 1676 by physician Joenisius, who removed the stones from a spontaneously
    occurring biliary fistula. \n\nStough Hobbs in 1867 performed the first recorded
    cholecystotomy, although such an operation was in fact described earlier by French
    surgeon Jean Louis Petit in the mid eighteenth century. \n\nGerman surgeon Carl
    Langenbuch performed the first cholecystectomy in 1882 for a sufferer of cholelithiasis.
    \n\nBefore this, surgery had focused on creating a fistula for drainage of gallstones.
    \n\nLangenbuch reasoned that given several other species of mammal have no gallbladder,
    humans could survive without one.\n\nThe debate whether surgical removal of the
    gallbladder or simply gallstones was preferred was settled in the 1920s, with
    the consensus that removal of the gallbladder was preferred. \n\nIt was only
    in the mid and late parts of the twentieth century that medical imaging techniques
    such as use of contrast medium and CT scans were used to view the gallbladder.
    \n\nThe first laparoscopic cholecystectomy performed by Erich M\xFChe of Germany
    in 1985, although French surgeons Phillipe Mouret and Francois Dubois are often
    credited for their operations in 1987 and 1988 respectively.\n\n\n== Society
    and culture ==\n\nTo have \"gall\" is associated with bold behaviour, whereas
    to have \"bile\" is associated with bitterness.\n\nIn the Chinese language, the
    gallbladder (Chinese: \u81BD) is associated with courage and a myriad of related
    idioms, including using terms such as \"a body completely [of] gall\" (Chinese:
    \u6E3E\u8EAB\u662F\u81BD) to describe a brave person, and \"single gallbladder
    hero\" (Chinese: \u5B64\u81BD\u82F1\u96C4) to describe a lone hero.In the Zangfu
    theory of Chinese medicine, the gallbladder not only has a digestive role, but
    is seen as the seat of decision-making.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallbladder"

  descriptionText: "\n\nURINARY BLADDER\n\n\nThe urinary bladder, or simply bladder,
    is a hollow muscular organ in humans and other vertebrates that stores urine
    from the kidneys before disposal by urination. \n\nIn humans the bladder is a
    hollow distensible organ that sits on the pelvic floor. \n\nUrine enters the
    bladder via the ureters and exits via the urethra. \n\nThe typical human bladder
    will hold between 300 and 500 ml before the urge to empty occurs, but can hold
    considerably more.\n\nThe Latin phrase for \"urinary bladder\" is vesica urinaria,
    and the term vesical or prefix vesico - appear in connection with associated
    structures such as vesical veins. \n\nThe modern Latin word for \"bladder\" \u2013
    cystis \u2013 appears in associated terms such as cystitis (inflammation of the
    bladder).\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\n\nIn humans, the bladder is a hollow muscular
    organ situated at the base of the pelvis. \n\nIn gross anatomy, the bladder can
    be divided into a broad fundus, a body, an apex, and a neck. \n\nThe apex is
    directed forward toward the upper part of the pubic symphysis, and from there
    the median umbilical ligament continues upward on the back of the anterior abdominal
    wall to the umbilicus. \n\nThe peritoneum is carried by it from the apex on to
    the abdominal wall to form the middle umbilical fold. \n\nThe neck of the bladder
    is the area at the base of the trigone that surrounds the internal urethral orifice
    that leads to the urethra. \n\nIn males the neck of the urinary bladder is next
    to the prostate gland.\nThe bladder has three openings. \n\nThe two ureters enter
    the bladder at ureteric orifices, and the urethra enters at the trigone of the
    bladder. \n\nThese ureteric openings have mucosal flaps in front of them that
    act as valves in preventing the backflow of urine into the ureters, known as
    vesicoureteral reflux. \n\nBetween the two ureteric openings is a raised area
    of tissue called the interureteric crest. \n\nThis makes the upper boundary of
    the trigone. \n\nThe trigone is an area of smooth muscle that forms the floor
    of the bladder above the urethra. \n\nIt is an area of smooth tissue for the
    easy flow of urine into and from this part of the bladder - in contrast to the
    irregular surface formed by the rugae.\n\nThe walls of the bladder have a series
    of ridges, thick mucosal folds known as rugae that allow for the expansion of
    the bladder. \n\nThe detrusor muscle is the muscular layer of the wall made of
    smooth muscle fibers arranged in spiral, longitudinal, and circular bundles.
    \n\nThe detrusor muscle is able to change its length. \n\nIt can also contract
    for a long time whilst voiding, and it stays relaxed whilst the bladder is filling.
    \n\nThe wall of the urinary bladder is normally 3\u20135 mm thick. \n\nWhen well
    distended, the wall is normally less than 3 mm.\n\n\n=== Nearby structures ===\n\n\nIn
    men, the prostate gland lies outside the opening for the urethra. \n\nThe middle
    lobe of the prostate causes an elevation in the mucous membrane behind the internal
    urethral orifice called the uvula of urinary bladder. \n\nThe uvula can enlarge
    when the prostate becomes enlarged.\nThe bladder is located below the peritoneal
    cavity near the pelvic floor and behind the pubic symphysis. \n\nIn men, it lies
    in front of the rectum, separated by the recto-vesical pouch, and is supported
    by fibres of the levator ani and of the prostate gland. \n\nIn women, it lies
    in front of the uterus, separated by the vesico-uterine pouch, and is supported
    by the elevator ani and the upper part of the vagina.\n\n\n=== Blood and lymph
    supply ===\n\nThe bladder receives blood by the vesical arteries and drained
    into a network of vesical veins. \n\nThe superior vesical artery supplies blood
    to the upper part of the bladder. \n\nThe lower part of the bladder is supplied
    by the inferior vesical artery, both of which are branches of the internal iliac
    arteries. \n\nIn females, the uterine and vaginal arteries provide additional
    blood supply. \n\nVenous drainage begins in a network of small vessels on the
    lower lateral surfaces of the bladder, which coalesce and travel with the lateral
    ligaments of the bladder into the internal iliac veins.\n\nThe lymph drained
    from the bladder begins in a series of networks throughout the mucosal, muscular
    and serosal layers. \n\nThese then form three sets of vessels: one set near the
    trigone draining the bottom of the bladder; one set draining the top of the bladder;
    and another set draining the outer undersurface of the bladder. \n\nThe majority
    of these vessels drain into the external iliac lymph nodes.\n\n\n=== Nerve supply
    ===\n\nThe bladder receives both sensory and motor supply from sympathetic and
    the parasympathetic nervous systems. \n\nThe motor supply from both sympathetic
    fibers, most of which arise from the superior and inferior hypogastric plexuses
    and nerves, and from parasympathetic fibers, which come from the pelvic splanchnic
    nerves.Sensation from the bladder, relating to distension or to irritation (such
    as by infection or a stone) is transmitted primarily through the parasympathetic
    nervous system. \n\nThese travel via sacral nerves to S2-4. \n\nFrom here, sensation
    travels to the brain via the dorsal columns in the spinal cord.\n\n\n=== Microanatomy
    ===\n\nWhen viewed under a microscope the bladder can be seen to have an inner
    lining (called epithelium), three layers of muscle fibres, and an outer adventitia.\n\nThe
    inner wall of the bladder is called urothelium, a type of transitional epithelium
    formed by three to six layers of cells; the cells may become more cuboidal or
    flatter depending on whether the bladder is empty or full. \n\nAdditionally,
    these are lined with a mucous membrane consisting of a surface glycocalyx that
    protects the cells beneath it from urine. \n\nThe epithelium lies on a thin basement
    membrane, and a lamina propria. \n\nThe mucosal lining also offers a urothelial
    barrier against the passing of infections.\n\nThese layers are surrounded by
    three layers of muscle fibres arranged as an inner layer of fibres orientated
    longitudinally, a middle layer of circular fibres, and an outermost layer of
    longitudinal fibres; these form the detrusor muscle, which can be seen with the
    naked eye.The outside of the bladder is protected by a serous membrane called
    adventitia.\n\n\n\n=== Development ===\n\n\nIn the developing embryo, at the
    hind end lies a cloaca. \n\nThis, over the fourth to the seventh week, divides
    into a urogenital sinus and the beginnings of the anal canal, with a wall forming
    between these two inpouchings called the urorectal septum. \n\nThe urogenital
    sinus divides into three parts, with the upper and largest part becoming the
    bladder; the middle part becoming the urethra, and the lower part changes depending
    on the biological sex of the embryo.The human urinary bladder derives from the
    urogenital sinus, and it is initially continuous with the allantois. \n\nThe
    upper and lower parts of the bladder develop separately and join together around
    the middle part of development. \n\nAt this time the ureters move from the mesonephric
    ducts to the trigone. \n\nIn males, the base of the bladder lies between the
    rectum and the pubic symphysis. \n\nIt is superior to the prostate, and separated
    from the rectum by the recto-vesical pouch. \n\nIn females, the bladder sits
    inferior to the uterus and anterior to the vagina; thus its maximum capacity
    is lower than in males. \n\nIt is separated from the uterus by the vesico-uterine
    pouch. \n\nIn infants and young children the urinary bladder is in the abdomen
    even when empty.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\n\nUrine, excreted by the kidneys, collects
    in the bladder because of drainage from two ureters, before disposal by urination
    (micturition). \n\nUrine leaves the bladder via the urethra, a single muscular
    tube ending in an opening called the urinary meatus, where it exits the body.
    \n\nUrination involves coordinated muscle changes involving a reflex based in
    the spine, with higher inputs from the brain. \n\nDuring urination, the detrusor
    muscle contracts, and the external urinary sphincter and muscles of the perineum
    relax, allowing urine to pass through the urethra and out of the body.\n\nThe
    urge to pass urine stems from stretch receptors that activate when between 300
    - 400 mL urine is held within the bladder. \n\nAs urine accumulates, the rugae
    flatten and the wall of the bladder thins as it stretches, allowing the bladder
    to store larger amounts of urine without a significant rise in internal pressure.
    \n\nUrination is controlled by the pontine micturition center in the brainstem.Stretch
    receptors in the bladder signal the parasympathetic nervous system to stimulate
    the muscarinic receptors in the detrusor to contract the muscle when the bladder
    is distended. \n\nThis encourages the bladder to expel urine through the urethra.
    \n\nThe main receptor activated is the M3 receptor, although M2 receptors are
    also involved and whilst outnumbering the M3 receptors they are not so responsive.\n\nThe
    main relaxant pathway is via the adenylyl cyclase cAMP pathway, activated via
    the \u03B23 adrenergic receptors. \n\nThe \u03B22 adrenergic receptors are also
    present in the detrusor and even outnumber \u03B23 receptors, but they do not
    have as important an effect in relaxing the detrusor smooth muscle.\n\n\n== Clinical
    significance ==\n\n\n=== Inflammation and infection ===\n\n\nCystitis refers
    to infection or inflammation of the bladder. \n\nIt commonly occurs as part of
    a urinary tract infection. \n\nIn adults, it is more common in women than men,
    owing to a shorter urethra. \n\nIt is common in males during childhood, and in
    older men where an enlarged prostate may cause urinary retention. \n\nOther risk
    factors include other causes of blockage or narrowing, such as prostate cancer
    or the presence of vesico-ureteric reflux; the presence of outside structures
    in the urinary tract, such as urinary catheters; and neurologic problems that
    make passing urine difficult. \n\nInfections that involve the bladder can cause
    pain in the lower abdomen (above the pubic symphysis, so called \"suprapubic\"
    pain), particularly before and after passing urine, and a desire to pass urine
    frequently and with little warning (urinary urgency). \n\nInfections are usually
    due to bacteria, of which the most common is E coli.When a urinary tract infection
    or cystitis is suspected, a medical practitioner may request a urine sample.
    \n\nA dipstick placed in the urine may be used to see if the urine has white
    blood cells, or the presence of nitrates which may indicate an infection. \n\nThe
    urine specimen may be also sent for microbial culture and sensitivity to assess
    if a particular bacteria grows in the urine, and identify its antibiotic sensitivities.
    \n\nSometimes, additional investigations may be requested. \n\nThese might include
    testing the function of the kidneys by assessing electrolytes and creatinine;
    investigating for blockages or narrowing of the renal tract with a ultrasound,
    and testing for an enlarged prostate with a digital rectal examination.\n\nUrinary
    tract infections or cystitis are treated with antibiotics, many of which are
    consumed by mouth. \n\nSerious infections may require treatment with intravenous
    antibiotics.Interstitial cystitis refers to a condition in which the bladder
    is infected due to a cause that is not bacteria.\n\n\n=== Incontinence and retention
    ===\n\nFrequent urination can be due to excessive urine production, small bladder
    capacity, irritability or incomplete emptying. \n\nMales with an enlarged prostate
    urinate more frequently. \n\nOne definition of an overactive bladder is when
    a person urinates more than eight times per day. \n\nAn overactive bladder can
    often cause urinary incontinence. \n\nThough both urinary frequency and volumes
    have been shown to have a circadian rhythm, meaning day and night cycles, it
    is not entirely clear how these are disturbed in the overactive bladder. \n\nUrodynamic
    testing can help to explain the symptoms. \n\nAn underactive bladder is the condition
    where there is a difficulty in passing urine and is the main symptom of a neurogenic
    bladder. \n\nFrequent urination at night may indicate the presence of bladder
    stones.\nDisorders of or related to the bladder include:\n\nBladder exstrophy\nBladder
    sphincter dyssynergia, a condition in which the sufferer cannot coordinate relaxation
    of the urethra sphincter with the contraction of the bladder muscles\nParuresis\nTrigonitis\nUrinary
    retention\n\nDisorders of bladder function may be dealt with surgically, by re-directing
    the flow of urine or by replacement with an artificial urinary bladder. \n\nThe
    volume of the bladder may be increased by bladder augmentation. \n\nAn obstruction
    of the bladder neck may be severe enough to warrant surgery.\n\n\n=== Cancer
    ===\n\n\nCancer of the bladder is known as bladder cancer. \n\nIt is usually
    due to cancer of the urothelium, the cells that line the surface of the bladder.
    \n\nBladder cancer is more common after the age of 40, and more common in men
    than women; other risk factors include smoking and exposure to dyes such as aromatic
    amines and aldehydes. \n\nWhen cancer is present, the most common symptom in
    an affected person is blood in the urine; a physical medical examination may
    be otherwise normal, except in late disease. \n\nBladder cancer is most often
    due to cancer of the cells lining the ureter, called transitional cell carcinoma,
    although it can more rarely occur as a squamous cell carcinoma if the type of
    cells lining the urethra have changed due to chronic inflammation, such as due
    to stones or schistosomiasis.\n\nInvestigations performed usually include collecting
    a sample of urine for an inspection for malignant cells under a microscope, called
    cytology, as well as medical imaging by a CT urogram or ultrasound. \n\nIf a
    concerning lesion is seen, a flexible camera may be inserted into the bladder,
    called cystoscopy, in order to view the lesion and take a biopsy, and a CT scan
    will be performed of other body parts (a CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis)
    to look for additional metastatic lesions.Treatment depends on the cancer's stage.
    \n\nCancer present only in the bladder may be removed surgically via cystoscopy;
    an injection of the chemotherapeutic mitomycin C may be performed at the same
    time. \n\nCancers that are high grade may be treated with an injection of the
    BCG vaccine into the bladder wall, and may require surgical removal if it does
    not resolve. \n\nCancer that is invading through the bladder wall may be managed
    by complete surgical removal of the bladder (radical cystectomy), with the ureters
    diverted into a segment of part of ileum connected to a stoma bag on the skin.
    \n\nPrognosis can vary markedly depending on the cancer's stage and grade, with
    a better prognosis associated with tumours found only in the bladder, that are
    low grade, that don't invade through the bladder wall, and that is papillary
    in visual appearance.\n\n\n=== Investigation ===\n\n\nA number of investigations
    are used to examine the bladder. \n\nThe investigations that are ordered will
    depend on the taking of a medical history and an examination. \n\nThe examination
    may involve a medical practitioner feeling in the suprapubic area for tenderness
    or fullness that might indicate an inflamed or full bladder. \n\nBlood tests
    may be ordered that may indicate inflammation; for example a full blood count
    may demonstrate elevated white blood cells, or a C-reactive protein may be elevated
    in an infection.Some forms of medical imaging exist to visualise the bladder.
    \n\nA bladder ultrasound may be conducted to view how much urine is within the
    bladder, indicating urinary retention. \n\nA urinary tract ultrasound, conducted
    by a more trained operator, may be conducted to view whether there are stones,
    tumours or sites of obstruction within the bladder and urinary tract. \n\nA CT
    scan may also be ordered.\nA flexible internal camera, called a cystoscope, can
    be inserted to view the internal appearance of the bladder and take a biopsy
    if required.\nUrodynamic testing can help to explain the symptoms.\n\n\n== Other
    animals ==\n\n\n=== Mammals ===\n\nAll mammals have a urinary bladder. \n\nThis
    structure begins as an embryonic cloaca. \n\nIn the vast majority, this eventually
    becomes differentiated into a dorsal part connected to the intestine and a ventral
    part which becomes associated with the urinogenital passage and urinary bladder.
    \n\nThe only mammals in which this does not take place are the platypus and the
    spiny anteater both of which retain the cloaca into adulthood.The mammalian bladder
    is an organ that regularly stores a hyperosmotic concentration of urine. \n\nIt
    therefore is relatively impermeable and has multiple epithelial layers. \n\nThe
    urinary bladder of the cetaceans (whales and dolphins) is proportionally smaller
    than that of land-dwelling mammals.\n\n\n=== Reptiles ===\n\nIn all reptiles,
    the urinogenital ducts and the anus both empty into an organ called a cloaca.
    \n\nIn some reptiles, a midventral wall in the cloaca may open into a urinary
    bladder, but not all. \n\nIt is present in all turtles and tortoises as well
    as most lizards but is lacking in the monitor lizard, the legless lizards. \n\nIt
    is absent in the snakes, alligators, and crocodiles.:\u200Ap. 474\u200AMany turtles,
    tortoises, and lizards have proportionally very large bladders. \n\nCharles Darwin
    noted that the Galapagos tortoise had a bladder which could store up to 20% of
    its body weight. \n\nSuch adaptations are the result of environments such as
    remote islands and deserts where water is very scarce. \n\nOther desert-dwelling
    reptiles have large bladders that can store a long-term reservoir of water for
    up to several months and aid in osmoregulation.\n\nTurtles have two or more accessory
    urinary bladders, located lateral to the neck of the urinary bladder and dorsal
    to the pubis, occupying a significant portion of their body cavity. \n\nTheir
    bladder is also usually bilobed with a left and right section. \n\nThe right
    section is located under the liver, which prevents large stones from remaining
    in that side while the left section is more likely to have calculi.\n\n\n===
    Amphibians ===\n\nMost aquatic and semi-aquatic amphibians have a membranous
    skin which allows them to absorb water directly through it. \n\nSome semi-aquatic
    animals also have similarly permeable bladder membrane. \n\nAs a result, they
    tend to have high rates of urine production to offset this high water intake,
    and have urine which is low in dissolved salts. \n\nThe urinary bladder assists
    such animals to retain salts. \n\nSome aquatic amphibian such as Xenopus do not
    reabsorb water, to prevent excessive water influx. \n\nFor land-dwelling amphibians,
    dehydration results in reduced urine output.The amphibian bladder is usually
    highly distensible and among some land-dwelling species of frogs and salamanders
    may account for between 20% and 50% of their total body weight.\n\n\n=== Fish
    ===\n\nThe gills of most teleost fish help to eliminate ammonia from the body,
    and fish live surrounded by water, but most still have a distinct bladder for
    storing waste fluid. \n\nThe urinary bladder of teleosts is permeable to water,
    though this is less true for freshwater dwelling species than saltwater species.\n\nMost
    fish also have an organ called a swim-bladder which is unrelated to the urinary
    bladder except in its membranous nature. \n\nThe loaches, pilchards, and herrings
    are among the few types of fish in which a urinary bladder is poorly developed.
    \n\nIt is largest in those fish which lack an air bladder, and is situated in
    front of the oviducts and behind the rectum.\n\n\n=== Birds ===\n\n\nIn nearly
    all bird species, there is no urinary bladder per se. \n\nAlthough all birds
    have kidneys, the ureters open directly into a cloaca which serves as a reservoir
    for urine, fecal matter, and eggs.\n\n\n=== Crustaceans ===\n\nUnlike the urinary
    bladder of vertebrates, the urinary bladder of crustaceans both stores and modifies
    urine. \n\nThe bladder consists of two sets of lateral and central lobes. \n\nThe
    central lobes sit near the digestive organs and the lateral lobes extend along
    the front and sides of the crustacean's body cavity. \n\nThe tissue of the bladder
    is thin epithelium.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_bladder"

  descriptionText: "\n\nSPLEEN\n\n\nThe spleen is an organ found in all vertebrates.
    \n\nSimilar in structure to a large lymph node, it acts primarily as a blood
    filter. \n\nThe word spleen comes from Ancient Greek \u03C3\u03C0\u03BB\u03AE\u03BD
    (spl\u1E17n).The spleen plays important roles in regard to red blood cells (erythrocytes)
    and the immune system. \n\nIt removes old red blood cells and holds a reserve
    of blood, which can be valuable in case of hemorrhagic shock, and also recycles
    iron. \n\nAs a part of the mononuclear phagocyte system, it metabolizes hemoglobin
    removed from senescent red blood cells (erythrocytes). \n\nThe globin portion
    of hemoglobin is degraded to its constitutive amino acids, and the heme portion
    is metabolized to bilirubin, which is removed in the liver.\n\nThe spleen houses
    antibody-producing lymphocytes in its white pulp and monocytes which remove antibody-coated
    bacteria and antibody-coated blood cells by way of blood and lymph node circulation.
    \n\nThese monocytes, upon moving to injured tissue (such as the heart after myocardial
    infarction), turn into dendritic cells and macrophages while promoting tissue
    healing. \n\nThe spleen is a center of activity of the mononuclear phagocyte
    system and is analogous to a large lymph node, as its absence causes a predisposition
    to certain infections.In humans the spleen is purple in color and is in the left
    upper quadrant of the abdomen.\n\n\n== Anatomy ==\n\nThe spleen is underneath
    the left part of the diaphragm, and has a smooth, convex surface that faces the
    diaphragm. \n\nIt is underneath the ninth, tenth, and eleventh ribs. \n\nThe
    other side of the spleen is divided by a ridge into two regions: an anterior
    gastric portion, and a posterior renal portion. \n\nThe gastric surface is directed
    forward, upward, and toward the middle, is broad and concave, and is in contact
    with the posterior wall of the stomach. \n\nBelow this it is in contact with
    the tail of the pancreas. \n\nThe renal surface is directed medialward and downward.
    \n\nIt is somewhat flattened, considerably narrower than the gastric surface,
    and is in relation with the upper part of the anterior surface of the left kidney
    and occasionally with the left adrenal gland.\n\nThere are four ligaments attached
    to the spleen: gastrosplenic ligament, splenorenal ligament, colicosplenic ligament,
    and phrenocolic ligament.\n\n\n=== Measurements ===\n\nThe spleen, in healthy
    adult humans, is approximately 7 centimetres (2.8 in) to 14 centimetres (5.5
    in) in length.\n\nAn easy way to remember the anatomy of the spleen is the 1\xD73\xD75\xD77\xD79\xD710\xD711
    rule. \n\nThe spleen is 1 by 3 by 5 inches (3 by 8 by 13 cm), weighs approximately
    7 oz (200 g), and lies between the 9th and 11th ribs on the left-hand side and
    along the axis of 10th rib. \n\nThe weight varies between 1 oz (28 g) and 8 oz
    (230 g) (standard reference range), correlating mainly to height, body weight
    and degree of acute congestion but not to sex or age.\t\t\n\n\n=== Blood supply
    ===\n\n\nNear the middle of the spleen is a long fissure, the hilum, which is
    the point of attachment for the gastrosplenic ligament and the point of insertion
    for the splenic artery and splenic vein. \n\nThere are other openings present
    for lymphatic vessels and nerves.\nLike the thymus, the spleen possesses only
    efferent lymphatic vessels. \n\nThe spleen is part of the lymphatic system. \n\nBoth
    the short gastric arteries and the splenic artery supply it with blood.The germinal
    centers are supplied by arterioles called penicilliary radicles.\n\n\n=== Nerve
    supply ===\n\nThe spleen is innervated by the splenic plexus, which connects
    a branch of the celiac ganglia to the vagus nerve.\n\nThe underlying central
    nervous processes coordinating the spleen's function seem to be embedded into
    the Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal-axis, and the brainstem, especially the subfornical
    organ.\n\n\n=== Development ===\n\nThe spleen is unique in respect to its development
    within the gut. \n\nWhile most of the gut organs are endodermally derived, the
    spleen is derived from mesenchymal tissue. \n\nSpecifically, the spleen forms
    within, and from, the dorsal mesentery. \n\nHowever, it still shares the same
    blood supply\u2014the celiac trunk\u2014as the foregut organs.\n\n\n== Function
    ==\n\n\n\n=== Pulp ===\n\n=== Other ===\n\nOther functions of the spleen are
    less prominent, especially in the healthy adult:\n\nSpleen produces all types
    of blood cells during fetal life\nProduction of opsonins, properdin, and tuftsin.\nCreation
    of red blood cells. \n\nWhile the bone marrow is the primary site of hematopoiesis
    in the adult, the spleen has important hematopoietic functions up until the 5th
    month of gestation. \n\nAfter birth, erythropoietic functions cease, except in
    some hematologic disorders. \n\nAs a major lymphoid organ and a central player
    in the reticuloendothelial system, the spleen retains the ability to produce
    lymphocytes and, as such, remains a hematopoietic organ.\n\nStorage of red blood
    cells, lymphocytes and other formed elements. \n\nThe spleen of horses stores
    roughly 30 percent of the red blood cells and can release them when needed. \n\nIn
    humans, up to a cup (240 ml) of red blood cells is held within the spleen and
    released in cases of hypovolemia and hypoxia. \n\nIt can store platelets in case
    of an emergency and also clears old platelets from the circulation. \n\nUp to
    a quarter of lymphocytes are stored in the spleen at any one time.\n\n\n== Clinical
    significance ==\n\n\n=== Enlarged spleen ===\n\n\nEnlargement of the spleen is
    known as splenomegaly. \n\nIt may be caused by sickle cell anemia, sarcoidosis,
    malaria, bacterial endocarditis, leukemia, pernicious anemia, Gaucher's disease,
    leishmaniasis, Hodgkin's disease, Banti's disease, hereditary spherocytosis,
    cysts, glandular fever (mononucleosis or 'Mono' caused by the Epstein\u2013Barr
    virus), and tumours. \n\nPrimary tumors of the spleen include hemangiomas and
    hemangiosarcomas. \n\nMarked splenomegaly may result in the spleen occupying
    a large portion of the left side of the abdomen.\n\nThe spleen is the largest
    collection of lymphoid tissue in the body. \n\nIt is normally palpable in preterm
    infants, in 30% of normal, full-term neonates, and in 5% to 10% of infants and
    toddlers. \n\nA spleen easily palpable below the costal margin in any child over
    the age of 3\u20134 years should be considered abnormal until proven otherwise.\n\nSplenomegaly
    can result from antigenic stimulation (e.g., infection), obstruction of blood
    flow (e.g., portal vein obstruction), underlying functional abnormality (e.g.,
    hemolytic anemia), or infiltration (e.g., leukemia or storage disease, such as
    Gaucher's disease). \n\nThe most common cause of acute splenomegaly in children
    is viral infection, which is transient and usually moderate. \n\nBasic work-up
    for acute splenomegaly includes a complete blood count with differential, platelet
    count, and reticulocyte and atypical lymphocyte counts to exclude hemolytic anemia
    and leukemia. \n\nAssessment of IgM antibodies to viral capsid antigen (a rising
    titer) is indicated to confirm Epstein\u2013Barr virus or cytomegalovirus. \n\nOther
    infections should be excluded if these tests are negative.\n\n\n=== Splenic injury
    ===\n\n\nTrauma, such as a road traffic collision, can cause rupture of the spleen,
    which is a situation requiring immediate medical attention.\n\n\n=== Asplenia
    ===\n\n\nAsplenia refers to a non-functioning spleen, which may be congenital,
    or caused by traumatic injury, surgical resection (splenectomy) or a disease
    such as sickle cell anaemia. \n\nHyposplenia refers to a partially functioning
    spleen. \n\nThese conditions may cause a modest increase in circulating white
    blood cells and platelets, a diminished response to some vaccines, and an increased
    susceptibility to infection. \n\nIn particular, there is an increased risk of
    sepsis from polysaccharide encapsulated bacteria. \n\nEncapsulated bacteria inhibit
    binding of complement or prevent complement assembled on the capsule from interacting
    with macrophage receptors. \n\nPhagocytosis needs natural antibodies, which are
    immunoglobulins that facilitate phagocytosis either directly or by complement
    deposition on the capsule. \n\nThey are produced by IgM memory B cells (a subtype
    of B cells) in the marginal zone of the spleen.A splenectomy (removal of the
    spleen) results in a greatly diminished frequency of memory B cells. \n\nA 28-year
    follow-up of 740 World War II veterans whose spleens were removed on the battlefield
    showed a significant increase in the usual death rate from pneumonia (6 rather
    than the expected 1.3) and an increase in the death rate from ischemic heart
    disease (41 rather than the expected 30), but not from other conditions.\n\n\n===
    Accessory spleen ===\n\nAn accessory spleen is a small splenic nodule extra to
    the spleen usually formed in early embryogenesis. \n\nAccessory spleens are found
    in approximately 10 percent of the population and are typically around 1 centimeter
    in diameter. \n\nSplenosis is a condition where displaced pieces of splenic tissue
    (often following trauma or splenectomy) autotransplant in the abdominal cavity
    as accessory spleens.Polysplenia is a congenital disease manifested by multiple
    small accessory spleens, rather than a single, full-sized, normal spleen. \n\nPolysplenia
    sometimes occurs alone, but it is often accompanied by other developmental abnormalities
    such as intestinal malrotation or biliary atresia, or cardiac abnormalities,
    such as dextrocardia. \n\nThese accessory spleens are non-functional.\n\n\n===
    Infarction ===\n\n\nSplenic infarction is a condition in which blood flow supply
    to the spleen is compromised, leading to partial or complete infarction (tissue
    death due to oxygen shortage) in the organ.\n\nSplenic infarction occurs when
    the splenic artery or one of its branches are occluded, for example by a blood
    clot. \n\nAlthough it can occur asymptomatically, the typical symptom is severe
    pain in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen, sometimes radiating to the left
    shoulder. \n\nFever and chills develop in some cases. \n\nIt has to be differentiated
    from other causes of acute abdomen.\n\n\n=== Hyaloserositis ===\n\nThe spleen
    may be affected by hyaloserositis, in which it is coated with fibrous hyaline.\n\n\n==
    Society and culture ==\n\nThere has been a long and varied history of misconceptions
    regarding the physiological role of the spleen, and it has often been seen as
    a reservoir for juices closely linked to digestion. \n\nIn various cultures,
    the organ has been linked to melancholia, due to the influence of ancient Greek
    medicine and the associated doctrine of humourism, in which the spleen was believed
    to be a reservoir for an elusive fluid known as \"black bile\" (one of the four
    humours). \n\nThe spleen also plays an important role in traditional Chinese
    medicine, where it is considered to be a key organ that displays the Yin aspect
    of the Earth element (its Yang counterpart is the stomach). \n\nIn contrast,
    the Talmud (tractate Berachoth 61b) refers to the spleen as the organ of laughter
    while possibly suggesting a link with the humoral view of the organ.\n\nEtymologically,
    spleen comes from the Ancient Greek \u03C3\u03C0\u03BB\u03AE\u03BD (spl\u1E17n),
    where it was the idiomatic equivalent of the heart in modern English. \n\nPersius,
    in his satires, associated spleen with immoderate laughter.In English, William
    Shakespeare frequently used the word spleen to signify melancholy, but also caprice
    and merriment. \n\nIn Julius Caesar, he uses the spleen to describe Cassius's
    irritable nature:\n\nThe spleen, as a byword for melancholy, has also been considered
    an actual disease. \n\nIn the early 18th century, the physician Richard Blackmore
    considered it to be one of the two most prevalent diseases in England (along
    with consumption). \n\nIn 1701, Anne Finch (later, Countess of Winchilsea) had
    published a Pindaric ode, The Spleen, drawing on her first-hand experiences of
    an affliction which, at the time, also had a reputation of being a fashionably
    upper-class disease of the English. \n\nBoth Blackmore and George Cheyne treated
    this malady as the male equivalent of \"the vapours\", while preferring the more
    learned terms \"hypochondriasis\" and \"hysteria\". \n\nIn the late 18th century,
    the German word Spleen came to denote eccentric and hypochondriac tendencies
    that were thought to be characteristic of English people.In French, \"spl\xE9n\xE9tique\"
    refers to a state of pensive sadness or melancholy. \n\nThis usage was popularised
    by the poems of Charles Baudelaire (1821\u20131867) and his collection Le Spleen
    de Paris, but it was also present in earlier 19th-century Romantic literature.\n\n\n==
    In animals ==\n\n\nIn cartilaginous and ray-finned fish, the spleen consists
    primarily of red pulp and is normally somewhat elongated, as it lies inside the
    serosal lining of the intestine. \n\nIn many amphibians, especially frogs, it
    has the more rounded form and there is often a greater quantity of white pulp.
    \n\nA study published in 2009 using mice found that the red pulp of the spleen
    forms a reservoir that contains over half of the body's monocytes.In reptiles,
    birds, and mammals, white pulp is always relatively plentiful, and in birds and
    mammals the spleen is typically rounded, but it adjusts its shape somewhat to
    the arrangement of the surrounding organs. \n\nIn most vertebrates, the spleen
    continues to produce red blood cells throughout life; only in mammals this function
    is lost in middle-aged adults. \n\nMany mammals have tiny spleen-like structures
    known as haemal nodes throughout the body that are presumed to have the same
    function as the spleen. \n\nThe spleens of aquatic mammals differ in some ways
    from those of fully land-dwelling mammals; in general they are bluish in colour.
    \n\nIn cetaceans and manatees they tend to be quite small, but in deep diving
    pinnipeds, they can be massive, due to their function of storing red blood cells.\n\nThe
    only vertebrates lacking a spleen are the lampreys and hagfishes (the Cyclostomata).
    \n\nEven in these animals, there is a diffuse layer of haematopoeitic tissue
    within the gut wall, which has a similar structure to red pulp and is presumed
    homologous with the spleen of higher vertebrates.\n\nIn mice the spleen stores
    half the body's monocytes so that upon injury, they can migrate to the injured
    tissue and transform into dendritic cells and macrophages to assist wound healing.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spleen"

  descriptionText: "\n\nURETER\n\n\nThe ureters are tubes made of smooth muscle that
    propel urine from the kidneys to the urinary bladder. \n\nIn a human adult, the
    ureters are usually 20\u201330 cm (8\u201312 in) long and around 3\u20134 mm
    (0.12\u20130.16 in) in diameter. \n\nThe ureter is lined by urothelial cells,
    a type of transitional epithelium, and has an additional smooth muscle layer
    that assists with peristalsis in its lowest third.\nThe ureters can be affected
    by a number of diseases, including urinary tract infections and kidney stone.
    \n\nStenosis is when a ureter is narrowed, due to for example chronic inflammation.
    \n\nCongenital abnormalities that affect the ureters can include the development
    of two ureters on the same side or abnormally placed ureters. \n\nAdditionally,
    reflux of urine from the bladder back up the ureters is a condition commonly
    seen in children.\nThe ureters have been identified for at least two thousand
    years, with the word \"ureter\" stemming from the stem uro- relating to urinating
    and seen in written records since at least the time of Hippocrates. \n\nIt is,
    however, only since the 1500s that the term \"ureter\" has been consistently
    used to refer to the modern structure, and only since the development of medical
    imaging in the 1900s that techniques such as X-ray, CT, and ultrasound have been
    able to view the ureters. \n\nThe ureters are also seen from the inside using
    a flexible camera, called ureteroscopy, which was first described in 1964.\n\n\n==
    Structure ==\n\n\nThe ureters are tubular structures, approximately 20\u201330
    cm (7.9\u201311.8 in) in adults, that pass from the pelvis of each kidney into
    the bladder. \n\nFrom the renal pelvis, they descend on top of the psoas major
    muscle to reach the brim of the pelvis. \n\nHere, they cross in front of the
    common iliac arteries. \n\nThey then pass down along the sides of the pelvis
    and finally curve forward and enter the bladder from its left and right sides
    at the back of the bladder. \n\nThe ureters are 1.5\u20136 mm (0.059\u20130.236
    in) in diameter and surrounded by a layer of smooth muscle for 1\u20132 cm (0.39\u20130.79
    in) near their ends just before they enter the bladder.The ureters enter the
    bladder from its back surface, traveling 1.5\u20132 cm (0.59\u20130.79 in) before
    opening into the bladder at an angle on its outer back surface at the slit-like
    ureteric orifices. \n\nThis location is also called the vesicoureteric junction.
    \n\nIn the contracted bladder, they are about 25 mm (1 in) apart and about the
    same distance from the internal urethral orifice; in the distended bladder, these
    measurements may be increased to about 50 mm (2 in).A number of structures pass
    by, above, and around the ureters on their path down from the kidneys to the
    bladder. \n\nIn its upper part, the ureter travels on the psoas major muscle
    and sits just behind the peritoneum. \n\nAs it passes down the muscle, it travels
    over the genitofemoral nerve. \n\nThe inferior vena cava and the abdominal aorta
    sit to the midline of the right and left ureters, respectively. \n\nIn the lower
    part of the abdomen, the right ureter sits behind the lower mesentery and the
    terminal ileum, and the left ureter sits behind the jejunum and the sigmoid colon.
    \n\nAs the ureters enter the pelvis, they are surrounded by connective tissue,
    and travel backward and outward, passing in front of the internal iliac arteries
    and internal iliac veins. \n\nThey then travel inward and forward, crossing the
    umbilical, inferior vesical, and middle rectal arteries. \n\nFrom here, in males,
    they cross under the vas deferens and in front of the seminal vesicles to enter
    the bladder near the trigone. \n\nIn females, the ureters pass behind the ovaries
    and then travel in the lower midline section of the broad ligament of the uterus.
    \n\nFor a short part, the uterine arteries travel on top for a short (2.5 cm
    (0.98 in)) period. \n\nThey then pass by the cervix, traveling inward towards
    the bladder.\n\n\n=== Blood and lymphatic supply ===\n\nThe arteries which supply
    the ureter vary along its course. \n\nThe upper third of the ureter, closest
    to the kidney, is supplied by the renal arteries. \n\nThe middle part of the
    ureter is supplied by the common iliac arteries, direct branches from the abdominal
    aorta, and gonadal arteries; the gonadal arteries being the testicular artery
    in men and the ovarian artery in women. \n\nThe lower third of the ureter, closest
    to the bladder, is supplied by branches from the internal iliac arteries, mainly
    the superior and inferior vesical arteries. \n\nThe arterial supply can be variable,
    with arteries that contribute include the middle rectal artery, branches directly
    from the aorta, and, in women, the uterine and vaginal arteries.The arteries
    that supply the ureters end in a network of vessels within the adventitia of
    the ureters. \n\nThere are many connections (anastamoses) between the arteries
    of the ureter, particularly in the adventitia, which means damage to a single
    vessel does not compromise the blood supply of the ureter. \n\nVenous drainage
    mostly parallels that of the arterial supply; that is, it begins as a network
    of smaller veins in the adventitia; with the renal veins draining the upper ureters,
    and the vesicular and gonadal veins draining the lower ureters.Lymphatic drainage
    depends on the position of lymphatic vessels in the ureter. \n\nLymph collects
    in submucosal, intramuscular and adventitial lymphatic vessels. \n\nThose vessels
    closer to the kidney drain into renal collecting vessels, and from here into
    the lateral aortic nodes near the gonadal vessels. \n\nThe middle part of the
    ureter drains into the right paracaval and interaortocaval nodes on the right,
    and the left paraaortic nodes on the left. \n\nIn the lower ureter, lymph may
    drain into the common iliac lymph nodes, or lower down in the pelvis to the common,
    external, or internal iliac lymph nodes.\n\n\n=== Nerve supply ===\n\nThe ureters
    are richly supplied by nerves that form a network (plexus) of nerves, the ureteric
    plexus that lies in the adventitia of the ureters. \n\nThis plexus is formed
    from a number of nerve roots directly (T9-12, L1, and S2-4), as well as branches
    from other nerve plexuses and nerves; specifically, the upper third of the ureter
    receives nerve branches from the renal plexus and aortic plexus, the middle part
    receives branches from the upper hypogastric plexus and nerve, and the lower
    ureter receives branches from the lower hypogastric plexus and nerve. \n\nThe
    plexus is in the adventitia. \n\nThese nerves travel in individual bundles and
    along small blood vessels to form the ureteric plexus. \n\nSensation supplied
    is sparse close to the kidneys and increases closer to the bladder.Sensation
    to the ureters is provided by nerves that come from T11 - L2 segments of the
    spinal cord. \n\nWhen pain is caused, for example by spasm of the ureters or
    by a stone, the pain may be referred to the dermatomes of T11 - L2, namely the
    back and sides of the abdomen, the scrotum (males) or labia majora (females)
    and upper part of the front of the thigh.\n\n\n=== Microanatomy ===\n\n\nThe
    ureter is lined by urothelium, a type of transitional epithelium that is capable
    of responding to stretches in the ureters. \n\nThe transitional epithelium may
    appear as a layer of column-shaped cells when relaxed, and of flatter cells when
    distended. \n\nBelow the epithelium sits the lamina propria. \n\nThe lamina propria
    is made up of loose connective tissue with many elastic fibers interspersed with
    blood vessels, veins and lymphatics. \n\nThe ureter is surrounded by two muscular
    layers, an inner longitudinal layer of muscle, and an outer circular or spiral
    layer of muscle. \n\nThe lower third of the ureter has a third muscular layer.
    \n\nBeyond these layers sits an adventitia containing blood vessels, lymphatic
    vessels, and veins.\n\n\n=== Development ===\n\n\nThe ureters develop from the
    ureteric buds, which are outpouchings from the mesonephric duct. \n\nThis is
    a duct, derived from mesoderm, found in the early embryo. \n\nOver time, the
    buds elongate, moving into surrounding mesodermal tissue, dilate, and divide
    into left and right ureters. \n\nEventually, successive divisions from these
    buds form not only the ureters, but also the pelvis, major and minor calyces,
    and collecting ducts of the kidneys.The mesonephric duct is connected with the
    cloaca, which over the course of development splits into a urogenital sinus and
    the anorectal canal. \n\nThe urinary bladder forms from the urogenital sinus.
    \n\nOver time, as the bladder enlarges, it absorbs the surrounding parts of the
    primitive ureters. \n\nFinally, the entry points of the ureters into the bladder
    move upwards, owing to the upward migration of the kidneys in the developing
    embryo.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\nThe ureters are a component of the urinary system.
    \n\nUrine, produced by the kidneys, travels along the ureters to the bladder.
    \n\nIt does this through regular contractions called peristalsis.\n\n\n== Clinical
    significance ==\n\n\n\n=== Ureteral stones ===\n\n\nA kidney stone can move from
    the kidney and become lodged inside the ureter, which can block the flow of urine,
    as well as cause a sharp cramp in the back, side, or lower abdomen. \n\nPain
    often comes in waves lasting up to two hours, then subsides, called renal colic.
    \n\nThe affected kidney could then develop hydronephrosis, should a part of the
    kidney become swollen due to blocked flow of urine. \n\nIt is classically described
    that there are three sites in the ureter where a kidney stone will commonly become
    stuck:\nwhere the ureter meets the renal pelvis; where the iliac blood vessels
    cross the ureters; and where the ureters enter the urinary bladder, however a
    retrospective case study, which is a primary source, of where stones lodged based
    on medical imaging did not show many stones at the place where the iliac blood
    vessels cross.Most stones are compounds containing calcium such as calcium oxalate
    and calcium phosphate. \n\nThe first recommended investigation is a CT scan of
    the abdomen because it can detect almost all stones. \n\nManagement includes
    analgesia, often with nonsteroidal antiinflammatories. \n\nSmall stones (< 4mm)
    may pass themselves; larger stones may require lithotripsy, and those with complications
    such as hydronephrosis or infection may require surgery to remove.\n\n\n=== Reflux
    ===\n\nVesicoureteral reflux refers to the reflux of fluid from the bladder into
    the ureters. \n\nThis condition can be associated with urinary tract infections,
    particularly in children, and is present in up to 28\u201336% of children to
    some degree. \n\nA number of forms of medical imaging are available for diagnosis
    of the condition, with modalities including doppler urinary tract ultrasound,
    MAG 3 nuclear medicine scaning, and a micturition urethrocystogram. \n\nFactors
    that affect which of these are selected depends if a child is able to receive
    a urinary catheter, and whether a child is toilet trained. \n\nWhether these
    investigations are performed at the first time a child has an illness, or later
    and depending on other factors (such as if the causal bacteria is E. coli) differ
    between US, EU and UK guidelines.Management is also variable, with differences
    between international guidelines on issues such as whether prophylactic antibiotics
    should be used, and whether surgery is recommended. \n\nOne reason is most instances
    of vesicoureteral reflux improve by themselves. \n\nIf surgery is considered,
    it generally involves reattaching the ureters to a different spot on the bladder,
    and extending the part of the ureter that it is within the wall of the bladder,
    with the most common surgical option being Cohen's cross-trigonal reimplantation.\n\n\n===
    Anatomical and surgical abnormalities ===\n\nBlockage, or obstruction of the
    ureter can occur, as a result of narrowing within the ureter, or compression
    or fibrosis of structures around the ureter. \n\nNarrowing can result of ureteric
    stones, masses associated with cancer, and other lesions such as endometriosis
    tuberculosis and schistosomiasis. \n\nThings outside the ureters such as constipation
    and retroperitoneal fibrosis can also compress them. \n\nSome congenital abnormalities
    can also result in narrowing or the ureters. \n\nCongenital disorders of the
    ureter and urinary tract affect 10% of infants. \n\nThese include partial or
    total duplication of the ureter (a duplex ureter), or the formation of a second
    irregularly placed (ectopic) ureter; or where the junction with the bladder is
    malformed or a ureterocoele develops (usually in that location). \n\nIf the ureters
    have been resited as a result of surgery, for example due to a kidney transplant
    or due to past surgery for vesicoureteric reflux, that site may also become narrowed.A
    narrowed ureter may lead to ureteric enlargement (dilation) and cause swelling
    of the kidneys (hydronephrosis). \n\nAssociated symptoms may include recurrent
    infections, pain or blood in the urine; and when tested, kidney function might
    be seen to decrease. \n\nThese are considered situations when surgery is needed.
    \n\nMedical imaging, including urinary tract ultrasound, CT or nuclear medicine
    imaging is conducted to investigate many causes. \n\nThis may involve reinserting
    the ureters into a new place on the bladder (reimplantion), or widening of the
    ureter. \n\nA ureteric stent may be inserted to relieve an obstruction. \n\nIf
    the cause cannot be removed, a nephrostomy may be required, which is the insertion
    of a tube connected to the renal pelvis which directly drains urine into a stoma
    bag.\n\n\n=== Cancer ===\n\nCancer of the ureters is known as ureteral cancer.
    \n\nIt is usually due to cancer of the urothelium, the cells that line the surface
    of the ureters. \n\nUrothelial cancer is more common after the age of 40, and
    more common in men than women; other risk factors include smoking and exposure
    to dyes such as aromatic amines and aldehydes. \n\nWhen cancer is present, the
    most common symptom in an affected person is blood in the urine; it may not cause
    symptoms, and a physical medical examination may be otherwise normal, except
    in late disease. \n\nUreteral cancer is most often due to cancer of the cells
    lining the ureter, called transitional cell carcinoma, although it can more rarely
    occur as a squamous cell carcinoma if the type of cells lining the urethra have
    changed due to chronic inflammation, such as due to stones or schistosomiasis.Investigations
    performed usually include collecting a sample of urine for an inspection for
    malignant cells under a microscope, called cytology, as well as medical imaging
    by a CT urogram or ultrasound. \n\nIf a concerning lesion is seen, a flexible
    camera may be inserted into the ureters, called ureteroscopy, in order to view
    the lesion and take a biopsy, and a CT scan will be performed of other body parts
    (a CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis) to look for additional metastatic
    lesions. \n\nAfter the cancer is staged, treatment may involve open surgery to
    remove the affected ureter and kidney if it is involved; or, if the lesion is
    small, it may be removed via ureteroscopy. \n\nPrognosis can vary markedly depending
    on the tumour grade, with a worse prognosis associated with an ulcerating lesion.\n\n\n===
    Injury ===\n\nInjuries to the ureter can occur after penetrating abdominal injuries,
    and injuries at high speeds followed by an abrupt stop (such as a high speed
    car accident). \n\nThe ureter can be injured during surgery to nearby structures.
    \n\nIt is injured in 2 per 10,000 cases of vaginal hysterectomies and 13 per
    10,000 cases of abdominal hysterectomies, usually near the suspensory ligament
    of the ovary or near the cardinal ligament, where the ureter runs close to the
    blood vessels of the uterus.\n\n\n=== Imaging ===\n\nSeveral forms of medical
    imaging exist that are used to view the ureters and urinary tract. \n\nUltrasound
    may be able to show evidence of blockage because of hydronephrosis of the kidneys
    and renal pelvis. \n\nCT scans, including ones where contrast media is injected
    intravenously to better show the ureters, and with contrast to better show lesions,
    and to differentiate benign from malignant lesions. \n\nDye may also be injected
    directly into the ureters or renal tract; an antegrade pyelogram is when contrast
    is injected directly into the renal pelvis, and a retrograde pyelogram is where
    dye is injected into the urinary tract via a catheter, and flows backwards into
    the ureters. \n\nMore invasive forms of imaging include ureteroscopy, which is
    the insertion of a flexible endoscope into the urinary tract to view the ureters.
    \n\nUreteroscopy is most commonly used for medium to large-sized stones when
    less invasive methods of removal are not able to be used.\n\n\n== Other animals
    ==\n\nAll vertebrates have two kidneys located behind the abdomen that produce
    urine, and have a way of excreting it, so that waste products within the urine
    can be removed from the body. \n\nThe structure specifically called the ureter
    is present in amniotes, meaning mammals, birds and reptiles. \n\nThese animals
    possess an adult kidney derived from the metanephros. \n\nThe duct that connects
    the kidney to excrete urine in these animals is the ureter. \n\nIt connects to
    the urinary bladder, from whence urine leaves via the urethra.\n\n\n== History
    ==\n\nThe word \"ureter\" comes from the Ancient Greek stem \"uro\" relating
    to urination, and the first use of the word is seen during the era of Hippocrates
    to refer to the urethra. \n\nThe anatomical structure of the ureter was noted
    by 40 AD. \n\nHowever, the terms \"ureter\" and \"urethra\" were variably used
    to refer to each other thereafter for more than a millennium. \n\nIt was only
    in the 1550s that anatomists such as Bartolomeo Eustacchio and Jacques Dubois
    began to use the terms to specifically and consistently refer to what is in modern
    English called the ureter and the urethra. \n\nFollowing this, in the 19th and
    20th centuries multiple terms relating to the structures such as ureteritis and
    ureterography, were coined.Kidney stones have been identified and recorded about
    as long as written historical records exist. \n\nThe urinary tract including
    the ureters, as well as their function to drain urine from the kidneys, has been
    described by Galen in the second century AD.The first to examine the ureter through
    an internal approach, called ureteroscopy, rather than surgery was Hampton Young
    in 1929. \n\nThis was improved on by VF Marshall who is the first published use
    of a flexible endoscope based on fiber optics, which occurred in 1964. \n\nThe
    insertion of a drainage tube into the renal pelvis, bypassing the ureters and
    urinary tract, called nephrostomy, was first described in 1941. \n\nSuch an approach
    differed greatly from the open surgical approaches within the urinary system
    employed during the preceding two millennia.The first radiological imaging of
    the ureters first occurred via X-rays, although this was made more difficult
    by the thick abdomen, which the low power of the original X-rays was not able
    to penetrate enough to produce clear images. \n\nMore useful images were able
    to be produced when Edwin Hurry Fenwick in 1908 pioneered the use of tubes covered
    in radioopaque material visible to X-rays inserted into the ureters, and in the
    early 20th century when contrasts were injected externally into the urinary tract
    (retrograde pyelograms). \n\nUnfortunately, much of the earlier retrograde pyelograms
    were complicated by significant damage to the kidneys as a result of contrast
    based on silver or sodium iodide. \n\nHryntshalk in 1929 pioneered the development
    of the intravenous urogram, in which contrast is injected into a vein and highlights
    the kidney and, when excreted, the urinary tract. \n\nThings improved with the
    development by Moses Swick and Leopold Lichtwitz in the late 1920s of relatively
    nontoxic contrast media, with controversy surrounding publication as to who was
    the primary discoverer. \n\nSide-effects associated with imaging improved even
    more when Tosten Almen published a ground-breaking thesis in 1969 based on the
    less toxic low-osmolar contrast media, developed based on swimming experiences
    in lakes with different salinity.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ureter"

  descriptionText: "\n\nSIGMOID COLON\n\n\nThe sigmoid colon (or pelvic colon) is
    the part of the large intestine that is closest to the rectum and anus. \n\nIt
    forms a loop that averages about 35\u201340 centimetres (14\u201316 in) in length.
    \n\nThe loop is typically shaped like a Greek letter sigma (\u03C2) or Latin
    letter S (thus sigma + -oid). \n\nThis part of the colon normally lies within
    the pelvis, but due to its freedom of movement it is liable to be displaced into
    the abdominal cavity.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe sigmoid colon begins at the
    superior aperture of the lesser pelvis, where it is continuous with the iliac
    colon, and passes transversely across the front of the sacrum to the right side
    of the pelvis.\n\nIt then curves on itself and turns toward the left to reach
    the middle line at the level of the third piece of the sacrum, where it bends
    downward and ends in the rectum.\n\nIts function is to expel solid and gaseous
    waste from the gastrointestinal tract. \n\nThe curving path it takes toward the
    anus allows it to store gas in the superior arched portion, enabling the colon
    to expel gas without excreting faeces simultaneously.\n\n\n=== Coverings ===\n\nThe
    sigmoid colon is completely surrounded by peritoneum (and thus is not retroperitoneal),
    which forms a mesentery (sigmoid mesocolon), which diminishes in length from
    the center toward the ends of the loop, where it disappears, so that the loop
    is fixed at its junctions with the iliac colon and rectum, but enjoys a considerable
    range of movement in its central portion.\n\n\n=== Nerve supply ===\n\nPelvic
    splanchnic nerves are the primary source for parasympathetic innervation. \n\nLumbar
    splanchnic nerves provide sympathetic innervation via the inferior mesenteric
    ganglion.\n\n\n=== Relations ===\n\nBehind the sigmoid colon are the external
    iliac vessels, ovary, obturator nerve, the left Piriformis, and left sacral plexus
    of nerves.\n\nIn front, it is separated from the bladder in the male, and the
    uterus in the female, by some coils of the small intestine.\n\n\n== Clinical
    significance ==\n\nDiverticulosis often occurs in the sigmoid colon in association
    with increased intraluminal pressure and focal weakness in the colonic wall.
    \n\nIt is a common cause of hematochezia.\nVolvulus occurs when a portion of
    the bowel twists around its mesentery, which can lead to obstruction and infarction.
    \n\nVolvulus in the elderly commonly occurs in the sigmoid colon, whereas in
    infants and children it is more likely to occur in the midgut. \n\nThis may correct
    itself spontaneously or the rotation may continue until the blood supply of the
    gut is cut off completely.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_colon"

  descriptionText: "\n\nDUODENUM\n\n\nThe duodenum is the first section of the small
    intestine in most higher vertebrates, including mammals, reptiles, and birds.
    \n\nIn fish, the divisions of the small intestine are not as clear, and the terms
    anterior intestine or proximal intestine may be used instead of duodenum. \n\nIn
    mammals the duodenum may be the principal site for iron absorption.\nThe duodenum
    precedes the jejunum and ileum and is the shortest part of the small intestine.\nIn
    humans, the duodenum is a hollow jointed tube about 25\u201338 cm (10\u201315
    inches) long connecting the stomach to the jejunum. \n\nIt begins with the duodenal
    bulb and ends at the suspensory muscle of duodenum. \n\nIt can be divided into
    four parts.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe duodenum is a 25\u201338 cm (10-15 inch)
    C-shaped structure lying adjacent to the stomach. \n\nIt is divided anatomically
    into four sections. \n\nThe first part of the duodenum lies within the peritoneum
    but its other parts are retroperitoneal.:\u200A273\u200A\n\n\n=== Parts ===\n\nThe
    first part, or superior part, of the duodenum is a continuation from the pylorus
    to transpyloric plane. \n\nIt is superior to the rest of the segments, at the
    vertebral level of L1. \n\nThe duodenal bulb, about 2 cm (0.79 in) long, is the
    first part of the duodenum and is slightly dilated. \n\nThe duodenal bulb is
    a remnant of the mesoduodenum, a mesentery that suspends the organ from the posterior
    abdominal wall in fetal life. \n\nThe first part of the duodenum is mobile, and
    connected to the liver by the hepatoduodenal ligament of the lesser omentum.
    \n\nThe first part of the duodenum ends at the corner, the superior duodenal
    flexure.:\u200A273\u200ARelations:\nAnterior\nGallbladder\nQuadrate lobe of liver\nPosterior\nBile
    duct\nGastroduodenal artery\nPortal vein\nInferior vena cava\nHead of pancreas\nSuperior\nNeck
    of gallbladder\nHepatoduodenal ligament (lesser omentum)\nInferior\nNeck of pancreas\nGreater
    omentum\nHead of pancreasThe second part, or descending part, of the duodenum
    begins at the superior duodenal flexure. \n\nIt goes inferior to the lower border
    of vertebral body L3, before making a sharp turn medially into the inferior duodenal
    flexure, the end of the descending part.:\u200A274\u200AThe pancreatic duct and
    common bile duct enter the descending duodenum, through the major duodenal papilla.
    \n\nThe second part of the duodenum also contains the minor duodenal papilla,
    the entrance for the accessory pancreatic duct. \n\nThe junction between the
    embryological foregut and midgut lies just below the major duodenal papilla.:\u200A274\u200AThe
    third part, or horizontal part or inferior part of the duodenum is 10~12 cm in
    length. \n\nIt begins at the inferior duodenal flexure and passes transversely
    to the left, passing in front of the inferior vena cava, abdominal aorta and
    the vertebral column. \n\nThe superior mesenteric artery and vein are anterior
    to the third part of duodenum.:\u200A274\u200A This part may be compressed between
    the aorta and SMA causing superior mesenteric artery syndrome.\nThe fourth part,
    or ascending part, of the duodenum passes upward, joining with the jejunum at
    the duodenojejunal flexure. \n\nThe fourth part of the duodenum is at the vertebral
    level L3, and may pass directly on top, or slightly to the left, of the aorta.:\u200A274\u200A\n\n\n===
    Blood supply ===\n\nThe duodenum receives arterial blood from two different sources.
    \n\nThe transition between these sources is important as it demarcates the foregut
    from the midgut. \n\nProximal to the 2nd part of the duodenum (approximately
    at the major duodenal papilla \u2013 where the bile duct enters) the arterial
    supply is from the gastroduodenal artery and its branch the superior pancreaticoduodenal
    artery. \n\nDistal to this point (the midgut) the arterial supply is from the
    superior mesenteric artery (SMA), and its branch the inferior pancreaticoduodenal
    artery supplies the 3rd and 4th sections.\nThe superior and inferior pancreaticoduodenal
    arteries (from the gastroduodenal artery and SMA respectively) form an anastomotic
    loop between the celiac trunk and the SMA; so there is potential for collateral
    circulation here.\nThe venous drainage of the duodenum follows the arteries.
    \n\nUltimately these veins drain into the portal system, either directly or indirectly
    through the splenic or superior mesenteric vein and then to portal vein .\n\n\n===
    Lymphatic drainage ===\n\nThe lymphatic vessels follow the arteries in a retrograde
    fashion. \n\nThe anterior lymphatic vessels drain into the pancreatoduodenal
    lymph nodes located along the superior and inferior pancreatoduodenal arteries
    and then into the pyloric lymph nodes (along the gastroduodenal artery).\nThe
    posterior lymphatic vessels pass posterior to the head of the pancreas and drain
    into the superior mesenteric lymph nodes. \n\nEfferent lymphatic vessels from
    the duodenal lymph nodes ultimately pass into the celiac lymph nodes.\n\n\n===
    Microanatomy ===\n\nUnder microscopy, the duodenum has a villous mucosa. \n\nThis
    is distinct from the mucosa of the pylorus, which directly joins to the duodenum.
    \n\nLike other structures of the gastrointestinal tract, the duodenum has a mucosa,
    submucosa, muscularis externa, and adventitia. \n\nGlands line the duodenum,
    known as Brunner's glands, which secrete mucus and bicarbonate in order to neutralise
    stomach acids. \n\nThese are distinct glands not found in the ileum or jejunum,
    the other parts of the small intestine. :\u200A274\u2013275\u200A\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n===
    Variation ===\n\n\n\n=== Gene and protein expression ===\n\n\nAbout 20,000 protein
    coding genes are expressed in human cells and 70% of these genes are expressed
    in the normal duodenum. \n\nSome 300 of these genes are more specifically expressed
    in the duodenum with very few genes expressed only in the duodenum. \n\nThe corresponding
    specific proteins are expressed in the duodenal mucosa, and many of these are
    also expressed in the small intestine, such as ANPEP, a digestive enzyme, ACE,
    an enzyme involved in control of blood pressure, and RBP2, a protein involved
    in the uptake of vitamin A.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\nThe duodenum is largely responsible
    for the breakdown of food in the small intestine, using enzymes. \n\nThe duodenum
    also regulates the rate of emptying of the stomach via hormonal pathways. \n\nSecretin
    and cholecystokinin are released from cells in the duodenal epithelium in response
    to acidic and fatty stimuli present there when the pylorus opens and emits gastric
    chyme into the duodenum for further digestion. \n\nThese cause the liver and
    gall bladder to release bile, and the pancreas to release bicarbonate and digestive
    enzymes such as trypsin, lipase and amylase into the duodenum as they are needed.\nThe
    villi of the duodenum have a leafy-looking appearance, which is a histologically
    identifiable structure. \n\nBrunner's glands, which secrete mucus, are found
    in the duodenum only. \n\nThe duodenum wall consists of a very thin layer of
    cells that form the muscularis mucosae.\n\n\n== Clinical significance ==\n\n\n\n===
    Ulceration ===\n\n\nUlcers of the duodenum commonly occur because of infection
    by the bacteria Helicobacter pylori. \n\nThese bacteria, through a number of
    mechanisms, erode the protective mucosa of the duodenum, predisposing it to damage
    from gastric acids. \n\nThe first part of the duodenum is the most common location
    of ulcers since it is where the acidic chyme meets the duodenal mucosa before
    mixing with the alkaline secretions of the duodenum. \n\nDuodenal ulcers may
    cause recurrent abdominal pain and dyspepsia, and are often investigated using
    a urea breath test to test for the bacteria, and endoscopy to confirm ulceration
    and take a biopsy. \n\nIf managed, these are often managed through antibiotics
    that aim to eradicate the bacteria, and PPIs and antacids to reduce the gastric
    acidity.\n\n\n=== Celiac disease ===\n\nThe British Society of Gastroenterology
    (BSG) guidelines specify that a duodenal biopsy is required for the diagnosis
    of adult celiac disease. \n\nThe biopsy is ideally performed at a moment when
    the patient is on a gluten-containing diet.\n\n\n=== Cancer ===\n\nDuodenal cancer
    is a cancer in the first section of the small intestine. \n\nCancer of the duodenum
    is relatively rare compared to stomach cancer and colorectal cancer; Malignant
    tumors in the duodenum constitute only around 0.3 % of all the gastrointestinal
    tract tumors but around half of cancerous tissues that develop in the small intestine.
    \n\nIts histology is often observed to be adenocarcinoma, meaning that the cancerous
    tissue arises from glandular cells in the epithelial tissue lining the duodenum.\n\n\n===
    Inflammation ===\n\nInflammation of the duodenum is referred to as duodenitis.
    \n\nThere are multiple known causes.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe name duodenum
    is from Medieval Latin, short for intest\u012Bnum duod\u0113num digit\u014Drum,
    which may be translated: intestine of twelve finger-widths (in length), from
    Latin duod\u0113num, genitive pl. of duod\u0113n\u012B, twelve each, from duodecim,
    twelve. \n\nThe Latin phrase intest\u012Bnum duod\u0113num digit\u014Drum is
    thought to be a loan-translation from the Greek word dodekadaktylon (\u03B4\u03C9\u03B4\u03B5\u03BA\u03B1\u03B4\u03AC\u03BA\u03C4\u03C5\u03BB\u03BF\u03BD),
    literally \"twelve fingers long.\" The intestinal section was so called by Greek
    physician Herophilus (c.335\u2013280 B.C.E.) for its length, about equal to the
    breadth of 12 fingers.\n\n\n== Accessory organs ==\n\nThe liver has so many functions
    but the main digestive function is making bile. \n\nThe gallbladder stores bile
    made from the liver. \n\nIt travels into the duodenum. \n\nThe pancreas makes
    enzymes that break down protein fat and carbohydrates. \n\nThe pancreas also
    makes bicarbonate which neutralizes the acid from the stomach.\n\n\n== Other
    animals ==\n\nThe duodenum is the first section of the small intestine in most
    higher vertebrates, including mammals, reptiles, and birds. \n\nIn fish, the
    divisions of the small intestine are not as clear, and the terms anterior intestine
    or proximal intestine may be used instead of duodenum. \n\nIn mammals the duodenum
    may be the principal site for iron absorption.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duodenum"

  descriptionText: "\n\nPAROTID DUCT\n\n\nThe parotid duct, or Stensen duct,is a
    salivary duct. \n\nIt is the route that saliva takes from the major salivary
    gland, the parotid gland, into the mouth.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe parotid
    duct is formed when several interlobular ducts, the largest ducts inside the
    parotid gland, join. \n\nIt emerges from the parotid gland. \n\nIt runs forward
    along the lateral side of the masseter muscle for around 7 cm. \n\nIn this course,
    the duct is surrounded by the buccal fat pad. \n\nIt takes a steep turn at the
    border of the masseter and passes through the buccinator muscle, opening into
    the vestibule of the mouth, the region of the mouth between the cheek and the
    gums, at the parotid papilla, which lies across the second Maxillary (upper)
    molar tooth.\n\nThe buccinator acts as a valve that prevents air forcing into
    the duct, which would cause pneumoparotitis. \n\nRunning along with the duct
    superiorly is the transverse facial artery and upper buccal nerve; running along
    with the duct inferiorly is the lower buccal nerve.\n\nThe exit of the parotid
    ducts can be felt as small bumps (papillae) on both sides of the mouth, and are
    usually positioned next to the maxillary second molars.\n\n\n=== Relations ===\n\nThe
    parotid duct lies close to the buccal branch of the facial nerve (VII). \n\nIt
    is also close to the transverse facial artery.\n\n\n== Clinical significance
    ==\n\nBlockage, whether caused by salivary duct stones or external compression,
    may cause pain and swelling of the parotid gland (parotitis).\n\nKoplik's spots
    which are pathognomonic of measles are found near the opening of the parotid
    duct.\n\nThe parotid duct may be cannulated by inserting a tube through the internal
    orifice in the mouth. \n\nDye may be injected to allow for imaging of the parotid
    duct.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe parotid duct is named after Nicolas Steno (1638\u20131686),
    also known as Niels Stensen, a Danish anatomist (albeit best known as a geologist)
    credited with its detailed description in 1660. \n\nThis is where the alternative
    name \"Stensen duct\" originates from.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parotid_duct"

  descriptionText: "\n\nPAROTID GLAND\n\n\nThe parotid gland is a major salivary
    gland in many animals. \n\nIn humans, the two parotid glands are present on either
    side of the mouth and in front of both ears. \n\nThey are the largest of the
    salivary glands. \n\nEach parotid is wrapped around the mandibular ramus, and
    secretes serous saliva through the parotid duct into the mouth, to facilitate
    mastication and swallowing and to begin the digestion of starches. \n\nThere
    are also two other types of salivary glands; they are submandibular and sublingual
    glands. \n\nSometimes accessory parotid glands are found close to the main parotid
    glands.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe word parotid literally means \"beside the
    ear\". \n\nFrom Greek \u03C0\u03B1\u03C1\u03C9\u03C4\u03AF\u03C2 (stem \u03C0\u03B1\u03C1\u03C9\u03C4\u03B9\u03B4-)
    : (gland) behind the ear < \u03C0\u03B1\u03C1\u03AC - par\xE1 : in front, and
    \u03BF\u1F56\u03C2 - ous (stem \u1F60\u03C4-, \u014Dt-) : ear.\n\n\n== Structure
    ==\n\nThe parotid glands are a pair of mainly serous salivary glands located
    below and in front of each ear canal, draining their secretions into the vestibule
    of the mouth through the parotid duct. \n\nEach gland lies behind the mandibular
    ramus and in front of the mastoid process of the temporal bone. \n\nThe gland
    can be felt on either side, by feeling in front of each ear, along the cheek,
    and below the angle of the mandible.\n\nThe parotid duct, a long excretory duct,
    emerges from the front of each gland, superficial to the masseter muscle. \n\nThe
    duct pierces the buccinator muscle, then opens into the mouth on the inner surface
    of the cheek, usually opposite the maxillary second molar. \n\nThe parotid papilla
    is a small elevation of tissue that marks the opening of the parotid duct on
    the inner surface of the cheek.The gland has four surfaces \u2013 superficial
    or lateral, superior, anteromedial, and posteromedial. \n\nThe gland has three
    borders \u2013 anterior, medial, and posterior. \n\nThe parotid gland has two
    ends \u2013 superior end in the form of small superior surface and an inferior
    end (apex). \n\nA number of different structures pass through the gland. \n\nFrom
    lateral to medial, these are:\n\nFacial nerve\nRetromandibular vein\nExternal
    carotid artery\nSuperficial temporal artery\nBranches of the great auricular
    nerve\nMaxillary arterySometimes accessory parotid glands are found as an anatomic
    variation. \n\nThese are close to the main glands and consist of ectopic salivary
    gland tissue.\n\nCapsule of parotid gland\n\nCapsule of the parotid gland is
    formed from the investing layer of the deep cervical fascia. \n\nIt is supplied
    by great auricular nerve. \n\nThe fascia splits to enclose the gland. \n\nThis
    splitting occurs between the angle of the mandible and the mastoid process. \n\nThe
    superficial lamina (parotidomassetric fascia) is thick and is attached to zygomatic
    arch. \n\nThe deep lamina is thin and is attached to styloid process, tympanic
    plate and the ramus of the mandible. \n\nThe part of deep lamina extending between
    the styloid process and the mandible is thickened to form stylomastoid ligament.
    \n\nThe stylomandibular ligament separates parotid gland from the superficial
    lobe of the submandibular gland.\n\n\n=== Location ===\n\nSuperficial or lateral
    relations: \n    The gland is situated deep to the skin, superficial fascia,
    superficial lamina of investing layer of deep cervical fascia and great auricular
    nerve (anterior ramus of C2 and C3).\n\nAnteromedial relations: \n    The gland
    is situated posterolaterally to the mandibular ramus, masseter and medial pterygoid
    muscles. \n\nA part of the gland may extend between the ramus and medial pterygoid,
    as the pterygoid process. \n\nBranches of facial nerve and parotid duct emerge
    through this surface.\n\nPosteromedial relations: \n    The gland is situated
    anterolaterally to mastoid process of temporal bone with its attached sternocleidomastoid
    and digastric muscles, styloid process of temporal bone with its three attached
    muscles (stylohyoid, stylopharyngeus, and styloglossus) and carotid sheath with
    its contained neurovasculature (internal carotid artery, internal jugular vein,
    and 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th cranial nerves).\n\nMedial relations: \n    The
    parotid gland comes into contact with the superior pharyngeal constrictor muscle
    at the medial border, where the anteromedial and posteromedial surfaces meet.
    \n\nHence, a need exists to examine the fauces in parotitis.\n\n\n=== Blood supply
    ===\n\nThe external carotid artery and its terminal branches within the gland,
    namely, the superficial temporal and the maxillary artery, also the posterior
    auricular artery supply the parotid gland. \n\nVenous return is to the retromandibular
    veins.\n\n\n=== Lymphatic drainage ===\n\nThe gland is mainly drained into the
    preauricular or parotid lymph nodes which ultimately drain to the deep cervical
    chain.\n\n\n=== Nerve supply ===\n\nThe parotid gland receives both sensory and
    autonomic innervation. \n\nGeneral sensory innervation to the parotid gland,
    its sheath, and the overlying skin is provided by the auriculotemporal nerve.
    \n\nThe autonomic innervation controls the rate of saliva production and is supplied
    by the glossopharyngeal nerve.\n\nThe cell bodies of the preganglionic sympathetic
    fibres usually lie in the lateral horns of upper thoracic spinal segments (T1-T3).
    \n\nPostganglionic sympathetic fibers from superior cervical sympathetic ganglion
    reach the gland as periarterial nerve plexuses around the external carotid artery
    and their function is mainly vasoconstriction. \n\nPreganglionic parasympathetic
    fibers leave the brain stem from inferior salivatory nucleus in the glossopharyngeal
    nerve and then through its tympanic and then the lesser petrosal branch pass
    into the otic ganglion. \n\nThere, they synapse with postganglionic fibers which
    reach the gland by hitch-hiking via the auriculotemporal nerve, a branch of the
    mandibular nerve.:\u200A255\u200A\n\n\n=== Histology ===\n\n\nThe gland has a
    capsule of its own of dense connective tissue, but is also provided with a false
    capsule by the investing layer of the deep cervical fascia. \n\nThe fascia at
    the imaginary line between the angle of the mandible and the mastoid process
    splits into a superficial and a deep lamina to enclose the gland. \n\nThe risorius
    is a small muscle embedded with this capsule substance.\nThe gland has short,
    striated ducts and long, intercalated ducts. \n\nThe intercalated ducts are also
    numerous and lined with cuboidal epithelial cells, and have lumina larger than
    those of the acini. \n\nThe striated ducts are also numerous and consist of simple
    columnar epithelium, having striations that represent the infolded basal cell
    membranes and mitochondria.\n\nThough the parotid gland is the largest, it provides
    only 25% of the total salivary volume. \n\nThe serous cell predominates in the
    parotid, making the gland secrete a mainly serous secretory product.\n\nThe parotid
    gland also secretes salivary alpha-amylase (sAA), which is the first step in
    the decomposition of starches during mastication. \n\nIt is the main exocrine
    gland to secrete this. \n\nIt breaks down amylose (straight chain starch) and
    amylopectin (branched starch) by hydrolyzing alpha 1,4 bonds. \n\nAdditionally,
    the alpha amylase has been suggested to prevent bacterial attachment to oral
    surfaces and to enable bacterial clearance from the mouth.\n\n\n== Development
    ==\n\nThe parotid salivary glands appear early in the sixth week of the prenatal
    development and are the first major salivary glands formed. \n\nThe epithelial
    buds of these glands are located on the inner part of the cheek, near the labial
    commissures of the primitive mouth (from ectodermal lining near angles of the
    stomodeum in the 1st/2nd pharyngeal arches; the stomodeum itself is created from
    the rupturing of the oropharyngeal membrane at about 26 days.) \n\nThese buds
    grow posteriorly toward the otic placodes of the ears and branch to form solid
    cords with rounded terminal ends near the developing facial nerve. \n\nLater,
    at around 10 weeks of prenatal development, these cords are canalized and form
    ducts, with the largest becoming the parotid duct for the parotid gland. \n\nThe
    rounded terminal ends of the cords form the acini of the glands. \n\nSecretion
    by the parotid glands via the parotid duct begins at about 18 weeks of gestation.
    \n\nAgain, the supporting connective tissue of the gland develops from the surrounding
    mesenchyme.\n\n\n== Parotid gland swellings ==\n\n=== Causes ===\n\n==== Mumps
    ====\n\nMumps is seen to be a common cause of parotid gland swelling \u2013 85%
    of cases occur in children younger than 15 years. \n\nThe disease is highly contagious
    and spreads by airborne droplets from salivary, nasal, and urinary secretions.
    \n\nSymptoms include oedema in the area, trismus as well as otalgia. \n\nThe
    lesion tends to begin on one side of the face and eventually becomes bilateral.
    \n\nThe transmission of the paramyxovirus is by contact with the infected persons
    saliva. \n\nInitial symptoms tend to be a headache and fever. \n\nMumps is not
    fatal, however further complications can include swelling of the ovaries or the
    testes. \n\nDiagnosis of mumps is confirmed through viral serology, management
    of the condition includes hydration and good oral hygiene of the patient requiring
    excellent motivation. \n\nHowever, since the development of the mumps vaccine,
    given at the age of between 4\u20136 years, the incidence of this viral infection
    has greatly reduced. \n\nThis vaccine has reduced the incidence by 99%.\n\n\n====
    Neoplasms ====\n\n===== Benign =====\n\nNeoplastic lesions of the parotid salivary
    gland can either be benign or malignant. \n\nWithin the parotid gland, nearly
    80% of tumours are benign. \n\nBenign lesions tend to be painless, asymptomatic
    and slow-growing. \n\nThe most common salivary gland neoplasms in children are
    hemangiomas, lymphatic malformations, and pleomorphic adenomas. \n\nDiagnosis
    of benign lesions require a fine-needle-like aspiration biopsy. \n\nWith various
    benign lesions, most commonly the pleomorphic adenoma, there is a risk of developing
    malignancy over time. \n\nAs a result, these lesions are typically resected.\n\nPleomorphic
    adenoma is seen to be a common benign neoplasm of the salivary gland and has
    an overall incidence of 54\u201368%. \n\nThe Warthin tumour has a lower incidence
    of 6\u201310%; this tumour is associated with smoking and is more common in older
    men. \n\nBenign lesions of the parotid gland have a significantly higher incidence
    than malignant lesions.\n\n\n===== Malignant =====\n\nMalignant salivary gland
    lesions are rare. \n\nHowever, when a tumour extends to the submandibular, sublingual
    and the minor salivary glands, they tend to be malignant. \n\nDistinguishing
    a malignant lesion from a benign one may be difficult as they both present as
    painless lesions. \n\nA biopsy is crucial in aiding diagnosis. \n\nThere are
    common signs that can highlight the presence of a malignant lesion. \n\nThese
    include facial nerve weakness, rapid increase of the size of the lump as well
    as ulceration of the mucosa of the skin.\n\nMucoepidermoid carcinoma is a common
    malignant tumour of the salivary glands and has a low incidence of 4\u201313%.
    \n\nAdenoid cystic carcinoma is also a common malignant salivary gland lesion
    and has an incidence of 4\u20138%. \n\nThis carcinoma tends to invade nerves
    and can re-occur post-treatment.\n\n\n==== Polycystic Parotid Disease ====\n\nA
    developmental polycystic disease of the salivary gland is seen to be extremely
    rare and is seen to be independent of recurrent parotitis. \n\nThe cause is thought
    to be a defect in the interactions between activin, follistatin and TGF-\u03B2,
    leading to a developmental disorder of glandular tissue.\n\n\n== Clinical significance
    ==\n\n=== Parotitis ===\n\nInflammation of one or both parotid glands is known
    as parotitis. \n\nThe most common cause of parotitis is mumps. \n\nWidespread
    vaccination against mumps has markedly reduced the incidence of mumps parotitis.
    \n\nThe pain of mumps is due to the swelling of the gland within its fibrous
    capsule.\n\nApart from viral infection, other infections, such as bacterial,
    can cause parotitis (acute suppurative parotitis or chronic parotitis). \n\nThese
    infections may cause blockage of the duct by salivary duct calculi or external
    compression. \n\nParotid gland swellings can also be due to benign lymphoepithelial
    lesions caused by Mikulicz disease and Sj\xF6gren syndrome. \n\nSwelling of the
    parotid gland may also indicate the eating disorder bulimia nervosa, creating
    the look of a heavy jaw line. \n\nWith the inflammation of mumps or obstruction
    of the ducts, increased levels of the salivary alpha amylase secreted by the
    parotid gland can be detected in the blood stream.\n\n\n=== Fibrous reactions
    ===\n\nTuberculosis and syphilis can cause granuloma formation in the parotid
    glands.\n\n\n=== Salivary stones ===\n\nSalivary stones mainly occur within the
    main confluence of the ducts and within the main parotid duct. \n\nThe patient
    usually complains of intense pain when salivating and tends to avoid foods which
    produce this symptom. \n\nIn addition, the parotid gland may become enlarged
    upon trying to eat. \n\nThe pain can be reproduced in clinic by squirting lemon
    juice into the mouth. \n\nSurgery depends upon the site of the stone: if within
    the anterior aspect of the duct, a simple incision into the buccal mucosa with
    sphinterotomy may allow removal; however, if situated more posteriorly within
    the main duct, complete gland excision may be necessary.\n\n\n=== Injury ===\n\nThe
    parotid salivary gland can also be pierced and the facial nerve temporarily traumatized
    when an inferior alveolar local anesthesia nerve block is incorrectly administered,
    causing transient facial paralysis.\n\n\n=== Cancer and tumours ===\n\nAbout
    80% of tumors of the parotid gland are benign. \n\nThe most common of these include
    pleomorphic adenoma (70% of tumors, of which 60% occur in females) and Warthin
    tumor (i.e. adenolymphoma, which is more common in males than in females). \n\nTheir
    importance is in relation to their anatomical position and tendency to grow over
    time. \n\nThe tumorous growth can also change the consistency of the gland and
    cause facial pain on the involved side.\n\nAround 20% of parotid tumors are malignant,
    with the most common tumors being mucoepidermoid carcinoma and adenoid cystic
    carcinoma. \n\nOther malignant tumors of the parotid gland include acinic cell
    carcinoma, carcinoma expleomorphic adenoma, adenocarcinoma (arising from ductal
    epithelium of parotid gland), squamous cell carcinoma (arising from parenchyma
    of parotid gland), and undifferentiated carcinoma. \n\nMetastasis from other
    sites like phyllodes tumour of breast presenting as parotid swelling have also
    been described. \n\nCritically, the relationship of the tumor to the branches
    of the facial nerve (CN VII) must be defined because resection may damage the
    nerves, resulting in paralysis of the muscles of facial expression.\n\n\n===
    Surgery ===\n\nSurgical treatment of parotid gland tumors is sometimes difficult
    because of the anatomical relations of the facial nerve parotid lodge, as well
    as the increased potential for postoperative relapse. \n\nThus, detection of
    early stages of a parotid tumor is extremely important in terms of postoperative
    prognosis. \n\nOperative technique is laborious, because of relapses and incomplete
    previous treatment made in other border specialties. \n\nSurgical techniques
    in parotid surgery have evolved in the last years with the use of neuromonitoring
    of the facial nerve and have become safer and less invasive.\n\nAfter surgical
    removal of the parotid gland (Parotidectomy), the auriculotemporal nerve is liable
    to damage and upon recovery it fuses with sweat glands. \n\nThis can cause sweating
    on the cheek on the side of the face of the affected gland. \n\nThis condition
    is known as Frey's syndrome.\n\n\n== Infections ==\n\n=== Bacterial infections
    ===\n\n==== Acute bacterial parotitis ====\n\nCommonly caused by a retrograde
    bacterial infection as a result of illness, sepsis, trauma, surgery, reduced
    salivary flow due to medications, diabetes, malnutrition and dehydration. \n\nClassically
    symptoms of painful swelling in the parotid region when eating seen. \n\nManagement
    is based upon antibacterials, rehydration combined with gentle massage to encourage
    salivary flow.\n\n\n==== Chronic bacterial parotitis ====\n\nA latent infection
    despite clinical resolution of the disease resulting in impaired function. \n\nHistologically
    glandular duct dilation, abscess formation and atrophy may be seen. \n\nParotid
    secretions are viscous. \n\nDisease course shows pain and swelling, waxing and
    waning. \n\nRadiographic screening should be undertaken to rule out sialolith.
    \n\nManagement with palliative care with parotidectomy as a last resort.\n\n\n\n===
    Viral infections ===\n\n==== Mumps ====\n\nAcute non-suppurative disease that
    often occurs in epidemics. \n\nPrevented by MMR vaccine. \n\nCaused by paramyxovirus
    that is transmitted by infected saliva and urine. \n\nA prodromal period of 24\u201328
    hours is experienced, followed by rapid and painful swelling of the parotid gland.
    \n\nTreatment is supportive (bedrest, hydration) as spontaneous resolution occurs
    within 5\u201310 days.\n\n\n==== HIV / AIDS ====\n\nDiffuse gland enlargement
    is seen, and may affect patients throughout all stages of the infection. \n\nLymphoepithelial
    cysts seen via imaging help aid diagnosis. \n\nPathogenic process occurs due
    to circulating CD8 lymphocytes within the salivary gland. \n\nMedical management
    via use of antiretrovirals, excellent oral hygiene measures and sialogogues.\n\n\n===
    Autoimmune related ===\n\n==== Systemic lupus erythematosus ====\n\nMost commonly
    seen in fourth and fifth decades in women, and can affect any salivary gland.
    \n\nPresentation is a slowly enlarging gland, with diagnosis made by identification
    of the underlying systemic disorder and measurements of salivary chemical levels.
    \n\nSodium and chloride ion levels will be elevated two or three times normal
    levels. \n\nTreatment is by addressing the underlying systemic condition.\n\n\n====
    Sarcoidosis ====\n\nSarcoidosis is a chronic systemic disease characterised by
    the production of non-caseating granulomas of unknown aetiology. \n\nIt can affect
    any organ of the body, depressing cellular immunity and enhancing humoral immunity.\n\nSalivary
    gland involvement primarily involves the parotid gland, causing enlargement and
    swelling. \n\nSalivary gland biopsy with histopathologic examination is needed
    to make the distinction between whether Sjoren\u2019s syndrome or sarcoidosis
    is the cause of this.\n\n\n==== Sjogren's syndrome ====\n\nSalivary gland enlargement
    occurs in up to 30% of patients with Sjogren\u2019s syndrome, with the parotid
    gland being most often enlarged, and bilateral parotid gland enlargement seen
    in 25\u201360% of patients. \n\nHowever, the parotid glands have a longer-lasting
    secretory capacity in Sjogren\u2019s syndrome patient and therefore are the last
    glands to manifest hyposalivation in the disease. \n\nHistopathology shows clustering
    of lymphocytic infiltrates and epimyoepithelial islands.\n\n\n=== Mycobacterial
    infection ===\n\n\nThe most common head and neck manifestation of tuberculosis
    mycobacterial disease is infection of cervical lymph nodes. \n\nThe infection
    is thought to originate in the tonsils or gingiva, ascending to the parotid gland.
    \n\nTwo clinical forms; acute and chronic lesions. \n\nAcute lesions have diffuse
    glandular edema, easily confused with acute sialdentitis or abscess. \n\nThe
    chronic lesions occur as slow growing masses mimicking tumors.\n\n\n== Examination
    of the salivary gland ==\n\n\n\n=== History and examination ===\n\nA patient
    with parotid swelling may complain of swelling, pain, xerostomia, bad taste and
    sometimes sialorrhoea.\n\nThe most common presenting symptom of neoplasms (both
    benign and malignant) is an asymptomatic swelling. \n\nPain is more common in
    patients with parotid cancer (10\u201329% feel pain) than those with benign neoplasms
    (only 2.5\u20134%), but pain itself it not diagnostic of malignancy.\n\nEpisodic
    swelling of major salivary glands accompanied by pain and related to salivary
    stimuli suggests duct obstruction.\n\nAlso need to assess the facial nerve. \n\nThe
    facial nerve passes through the parotid so may be affected if there is a change
    in the parotid gland. \n\nFacial nerve paralysis in a previously untreated patient
    usually indicates that a tumour is malignant.\n\n\n=== Physical examination ===\n\nThe
    superficial location of the salivary glands allows palpation and visual inspection.
    \n\nThe inspection must be systematic, both intraorally and extraorally, so no
    area is missed.\n\nFor extraoral examination the patients head should be inclined
    forwards in order to maximally expose the parotid and submandibular glands. \n\nA
    normal parotid gland is barely palpable and a normal sublingual gland is not
    palpable.Intra-oral examination should include observations for asymmetry, discolouration,
    pulsation and obstructions in the duct orifices. \n\nSwelling of the deep lobe
    of the parotid gland may be seen intra-orally, and may also displace the tonsil.
    \n\nThe minor salivary glands should be examined. \n\nThe labial, buccal and
    posterior palatal mucosa should be dried with an air blower or tissue and pressed
    to assess the flow of saliva.\n\n\n=== Salivary testing ===\n\nSalivary stimulation\n\nThis
    can be done by palpating the parotid gland, thus stimulating it. \n\nAssess to
    see whether there is saliva flowing from the parotid papilla.Sialography\n\nSialograms
    can identify changes in salivary gland architecture and are useful in the evaluation
    of major gland swellings.\n\nIt involves the instillation of a radio-opaque fluid
    into the major gland ductal system. \n\nThis outlines the major and minor ductal
    systems, and also gives an outline of the glandular tissue.\n\nFor example, sialadenitis
    creates an appearance known as \u201Cpruning of the tree\u201D on a sialogram,
    where there are less branches visible from the duct system. \n\nAlso, a space
    occupying lesion that occurs within or adjacent to a salivary gland can displace
    the normal anatomy of the gland. \n\nThis may create an appearance known as \u201Cball
    in hand\u201D on a sialogram, where the ducts are curved around the mass of the
    lesion.Sialochemistry\n\nThe composition of saliva changes in disease states,
    and analysis of saliva for enzymes, electrolytes, hormones, drugs and immunisation
    status can be performed.Radioisotope scintigraphy \n\nGives an objective measure
    of isotope uptake and excretion using a gamma scintillation camera. \n\nAfter
    about 20 minutes, a salivary stimulant will be given to promote salivary flow
    through the gland. \n\nThey are used to assess patients with persistent symptoms
    of dry mouth and also to evaluate salivary gland swelling due to infection, inflammation
    or obstruction.\n\n\n=== Further tests ===\n\n-Imagining techniques\n\n-Ultrasounds,
    CT Scans or MRIs can aid with disease localisation\n\n-Sialoendoscopy\n\n-A camera
    is inserted into the duct of a salivary gland to assess blockages\n\n-Biopsy\n\n-This
    can be done by fine needle aspiration biopsy, which provides an opportunity to
    obtain information about the histology of a salivary tumour prior to initiation
    of treatment.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parotid_gland"

  descriptionText: "\n\nSUBMANDIBULAR DUCT\n\n\nThe submandibular duct or Wharton
    duct or submaxillary duct, is one of the salivary excretory ducts. \n\nIt is
    about 5 cm. long, and its wall is much thinner than that of the parotid duct.
    \n\nIt drains saliva from each bilateral submandibular gland and sublingual gland
    to the sublingual caruncle at the base of the tongue.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\n\nThe
    submandibular duct arises from deep part of submandibular gland, a salivary gland.
    \n\nIt begins by numerous branches from the superficial surface of the gland,
    and runs forward between the mylohyoid, hyoglossus, and genioglossus muscles.
    \n\nIt then passes between the sublingual gland and the genioglossus and opens
    by a narrow opening on the summit of a small papilla (the \"sublingual caruncle\")
    at the side of the frenulum of the tongue. \n\nIt lies superior to lingual and
    hypoglossal nerves.\n\n\n=== Variation ===\n\nThe submandibular duct may be duplicated
    on one side or both sides, creating an accessory submandibular duct. \n\nRarely,
    it may not perforate into the mouth.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\nThe submandibular
    ducts drain saliva from the submandibular gland, and the sublingual glands to
    the sublingual caruncles at the base of the tongue.\n\n\n== Clinical significance
    ==\n\n\n=== Sialolithiasis ===\n\nThe submandibular duct may be affected by stones,
    known as sialolithiasis. \n\nThese may grow large, requiring surgery to remove.
    \n\nSimple palpation may be used to identify the location of any stones before
    surgery.\n\n\n=== Imperforate ===\n\nRarely, the submandibular duct may not perforate
    into the mouth. \n\nSurgery may be used to repair this birth defect.\n\n\n===
    Drooling ===\n\nThe exit of the submandibular gland into the mouth may be realigned
    in patients who drool. \n\nThis redirects the exiting saliva away from the vestibule
    and the lips. \n\nThis surgery has a fairly high success rate. \n\nRarely, the
    submandibular gland may need to be removed on one or both sides.\n\n\n== History
    ==\n\nThe submandibular duct was initially described by the English anatomist
    Thomas Wharton ( 1614-73) and is sometimes referred to by his name.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submandibular_duct"

  descriptionText: "\n\nVERMIFORM APPENDIX/\nAPPENDIX\n\n\nThe appendix (or vermiform
    appendix; also cecal [or caecal] appendix; vermix; or vermiform process) is a
    finger-like, blind-ended tube connected to the cecum, from which it develops
    in the embryo. \n\nThe cecum is a pouch-like structure of the large intestine,
    located at the junction of the small and the large intestines. \n\nThe term \"vermiform\"
    comes from Latin and means \"worm-shaped.\" The appendix used to be considered
    a vestigial organ, but this view has changed over the past decades. \n\nResearch
    suggests that the appendix may serve an important purpose. \n\nIn particular,
    it may serve as a reservoir for beneficial gut bacteria.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe
    human appendix averages 9 cm (3.5 in) in length but can range from 5 to 35 cm
    (2.0 to 13.8 in). \n\nThe diameter of the appendix is 6 mm (0.24 in), and more
    than 6 mm (0.24 in) is considered a thickened or inflamed appendix. \n\nThe longest
    appendix ever removed was 26 cm (10 in) long. \n\nThe appendix is usually located
    in the lower right quadrant of the abdomen, near the right hip bone. \n\nThe
    base of the appendix is located 2 cm (0.79 in) beneath the ileocecal valve that
    separates the large intestine from the small intestine. \n\nIts position within
    the abdomen corresponds to a point on the surface known as McBurney's point.\n\nThe
    appendix is connected to the mesentery in the lower region of the ileum, by a
    short region of the mesocolon known as the mesoappendix.\n\n\n=== Variation ===\n\nSome
    identical twins\u2014known as mirror image twins\u2014can have a mirror-imaged
    anatomy, a congenital condition with the appendix located in the lower left quadrant
    of the abdomen instead of the lower right. \n\nIntestinal malrotation may also
    cause displacement of the appendix to the left side.\n\nWhile the base of the
    appendix is typically located 2 cm (0.79 in) below the ileocecal valve, the tip
    of the appendix can be variably located\u2014in the pelvis, outside the peritoneum
    or behind the cecum. \n\nThe prevalence of the different positions varies amongst
    populations with the retrocecal position being most common in Ghana and Sudan,
    with 67.3% and 58.3% occurrence respectively, in comparison to Iran and Bosnia
    where the pelvic position is most common, with 55.8% and 57.7% occurrence respectively.\n\nIn
    very rare cases, the appendix may not be present at all (laparotomies for suspected
    appendicitis have given a frequency of 1 in 100,000).Sometimes there is a semi-circular
    fold of mucous membrane at the opening of the appendix. \n\nThis valve of the
    vermiform appendix is also called Gerlach's valve.\n\n\n== Functions ==\n\n===
    Maintaining gut flora ===\n\nAlthough it has been long accepted that the immune
    tissue surrounding the appendix and elsewhere in the gut\u2014called gut-associated
    lymphoid tissue\u2014carries out a number of important functions, explanations
    were lacking for the distinctive shape of the appendix and its apparent lack
    of specific importance and function as judged by an absence of side effects following
    its removal. \n\nTherefore, the notion that the appendix is only vestigial became
    widely held.\nWilliam Parker, Randy Bollinger, and colleagues at Duke University
    proposed in 2007 that the appendix serves as a haven for useful bacteria when
    illness flushes the bacteria from the rest of the intestines. \n\nThis proposition
    is based on an understanding that emerged by the early 2000s of how the immune
    system supports the growth of beneficial intestinal bacteria, in combination
    with many well-known features of the appendix, including its architecture, its
    location just below the normal one-way flow of food and germs in the large intestine,
    and its association with copious amounts of immune tissue. \n\nResearch performed
    at Winthrop\u2013University Hospital showed that individuals without an appendix
    were four times as likely to have a recurrence of Clostridium difficile colitis.
    \n\nThe appendix, therefore, may act as a \"safe house\" for beneficial bacteria.
    \n\nThis reservoir of bacteria could then serve to repopulate the gut flora in
    the digestive system following a bout of dysentery or cholera or to boost it
    following a milder gastrointestinal illness.\n\n\n=== Immune and lymphatic systems
    ===\n\nThe appendix has been identified as an important component of mammalian
    mucosal immune function, particularly B cell-mediated immune responses and extrathymically
    derived T cells. \n\nThis structure helps in the proper movement and removal
    of waste matter in the digestive system, contains lymphatic vessels that regulate
    pathogens, and lastly, might even produce early defences that prevent deadly
    diseases. \n\nAdditionally, it is thought that this may provide more immune defences
    from invading pathogens and getting the lymphatic system's B and T cells to fight
    the viruses and bacteria that infect that portion of the bowel and training them
    so that immune responses are targeted and more able to reliably and less dangerously
    fight off pathogens. \n\nIn addition, there are different immune cells called
    innate lymphoid cells that function in the gut in order to help the appendix
    maintain digestive health. \n\nResearch also shows a positive correlation between
    the existence of appendix and the concentration of cecal lymphoid tissue, which
    supports that not only does the appendix evolve as a complex with the cecum but
    also has major immune benefits. \n\n\n== Clinical significance ==\n\nCommon diseases
    of the appendix (in humans) are appendicitis and carcinoid tumors (appendiceal
    carcinoid). \n\nAppendix cancer accounts for about 1 in 200 of all gastrointestinal
    malignancies. \n\nIn rare cases, adenomas are also present.\n\n\n=== Appendicitis
    ===\n\n\nAppendicitis is a condition characterized by inflammation of the appendix.
    \n\nPain often begins in the center of the abdomen, corresponding to the appendix's
    development as part of the embryonic midgut. \n\nThis pain is typically a dull,
    poorly localized, visceral pain.As the inflammation progresses, the pain begins
    to localize more clearly to the right lower quadrant, as the peritoneum becomes
    inflamed. \n\nThis peritoneal inflammation, or peritonitis, results in rebound
    tenderness (pain upon removal of pressure rather than application of pressure).
    \n\nIn particular, it presents at McBurney's point, 1/3 of the way along a line
    drawn from the anterior superior iliac spine to the umbilicus. \n\nTypically,
    point (skin) pain is not present until the parietal peritoneum is inflamed, as
    well. \n\nFever and an immune system response are also characteristic of appendicitis.
    \n\nOther signs and symptoms may include nausea and vomiting, low-grade fever
    that may get worse, constipation or diarrhea, abdominal bloating, or flatulence.Appendicitis
    usually requires the removal of the inflamed appendix, in an appendectomy either
    by laparotomy or laparoscopy. \n\nUntreated, the appendix may rupture, leading
    to peritonitis, followed by shock, and, if still untreated, death.Recently, practitioners
    reported good results in treating appendicitis without appendectomy. \n\nManaging
    appendicitis using only antibiotic treatment and cooling of the appendix was
    successful in first occurrence acute appendicitis without complication.\n\n\n===
    Surgery ===\n\n\nThe surgical removal of the appendix is called an appendectomy.
    \n\nThis removal is normally performed as an emergency procedure when the patient
    is suffering from acute appendicitis. \n\nIn the absence of surgical facilities,
    intravenous antibiotics are used to delay or avoid the onset of sepsis. \n\nIn
    some cases, the appendicitis resolves completely; more often, an inflammatory
    mass forms around the appendix. \n\nThis is a relative contraindication to surgery.\nThe
    appendix is also used for the construction of an efferent urinary conduit, in
    an operation known as the Mitrofanoff procedure, in people with a neurogenic
    bladder.\n\nThe appendix is also used as a means to access the colon in children
    with paralysed bowels or major rectal sphincter problems. \n\nThe appendix is
    brought out to the skin surface and the child/parent can then attach a catheter
    and easily wash out the colon (via normal defaecation) using an appropriate solution.\n\n\n==
    History ==\n\nCharles Darwin suggested that the appendix was mainly used by earlier
    hominids for digesting fibrous vegetation, then evolved to take on a new purpose
    over time. \n\nThe very long cecum of some herbivorous animals, such as in the
    horse or the koala, appears to support this hypothesis. \n\nThe koala's cecum
    enables it to host bacteria that specifically help to break down cellulose. \n\nHuman
    ancestors may have also relied upon this system when they lived on a diet rich
    in foliage. \n\nAs people began to eat more easily digested foods, they may have
    become less reliant on cellulose-rich plants for energy. \n\nAs the cecum became
    less necessary for digestion, mutations that were previously deleterious (and
    would have hindered evolutionary progress) were no longer important, so the mutations
    survived. \n\nIt is suggested that these alleles became more frequent and the
    cecum continued to shrink. \n\nAfter millions of years, the once-necessary cecum
    degraded to be the appendix of modern humans.Dr. \n\nHeather F. \n\nSmith of
    Midwestern University and colleagues explained:\n\nRecently ... improved understanding
    of gut immunity has merged with current thinking in biological and medical science,
    pointing to an apparent function of the mammalian cecal appendix as a safe-house
    for symbiotic gut microbes, preserving the flora during times of gastrointestinal
    infection in societies without modern medicine. \n\nThis function is potentially
    a selective force for the evolution and maintenance of the appendix.\n\nThree
    morphotypes of cecal-appendices can be described among mammals based primarily
    on the shape of the cecum: a distinct appendix branching from a rounded or sac-like
    cecum (as in many primate species), an appendix located at the apex of a long
    and voluminous cecum (as in the rabbit, greater glider and Cape dune mole rat),
    and an appendix in the absence of a pronounced cecum (as in the wombat). \n\nIn
    addition, long narrow appendix-like structures are found in mammals that either
    lack an apparent cecum (as in monotremes) or lack a distinct junction between
    the cecum and appendix-like structure (as in the koala). \n\nA cecal appendix
    has evolved independently at least twice, and apparently represents yet another
    example of convergence in morphology between Australian marsupials and placentals
    in the rest of the world. \n\nAlthough the appendix has apparently been lost
    by numerous species, it has also been maintained for more than 80 million years
    in at least one clade.\n\nIn a 2013 paper, the appendix was found to have evolved
    at least 32 times (and perhaps as many as 38 times) and to have been lost no
    more than six times. \n\nA more recent study using similar methods on an updated
    database yielded similar, though less spectacular results, with at least 29 gains
    and at the most 12 losses (all of which were ambiguous), and this is still significantly
    asymmetrical. \n\nThis suggests that the cecal appendix has a selective advantage
    in many situations and argues strongly against its vestigial nature. \n\nThis
    complex evolutionary history of the appendix, along with a great heterogeneity
    in its evolutionary rate in various taxa, suggests that it is a recurrent trait.\n\nSuch
    a function may be useful in a culture lacking modern sanitation and healthcare
    practice, where diarrhea may be prevalent. \n\nCurrent epidemiological data on
    the cause of death in developed countries collected by the World Health Organization
    in 2001 show that acute diarrhea is now the fourth leading cause of disease-related
    death in developing countries (data summarized by The Bill and Melinda Gates
    Foundation). \n\nTwo of the other leading causes of death are expected to have
    exerted limited or no selection pressure.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appendix_(anatomy)"

  descriptionText: "\n\nDUCTUS DEFERENS/VAS DEFERENS\n\n\nThe vas deferens, or ductus
    deferens, is part of the male reproductive system of many vertebrates. \n\nThe
    ducts transport sperm from the epididymis to the ejaculatory ducts in anticipation
    of ejaculation. \n\nThe vas deferens is a partially coiled tube which exits the
    abdominal cavity through the inguinal canal.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nVas deferens
    is Latin, meaning \"carrying-away vessel\"; the plural version is vasa deferentia.
    \n\nDuctus deferens is also Latin, meaning \"carrying-away duct\"; the plural
    version is ductus deferentes.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThere are two vasa deferentia,
    connecting the left and right epididymis with the seminal vesicles to form the
    ejaculatory duct in order to move sperm. \n\nIn humans, each tube is about 30
    centimeters (1 ft) long, 3 to 5 mm (0.118 to 0.197 inches) in diameter and is
    muscular (surrounded by smooth muscle). \n\nIts epithelium is pseudostratified
    columnar epithelium lined by stereocilia.\nThey are part of the spermatic cords.\n\n\n===
    Blood supply ===\n\nThe vas deferens is supplied by an accompanying artery (artery
    of vas deferens). \n\nThis artery normally arises from the superior (sometimes
    inferior) vesical artery, a branch of the internal iliac artery.\n\n\n=== Nerve
    supply ===\n\nThe vas deferens is innervated by a variety of different types
    of nerve ending. \n\nAdrenergic synapses are found in the smooth muscle layers.
    \n\nCholinergic synapses and vasoactive intestinal peptide synapses are found
    in the connective tissue of the mucosa. \n\nNoradrenergic synapses may also be
    present in the vas deferens.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\nDuring ejaculation, the smooth
    muscle in the walls of the vas deferens contracts reflexively, thus propelling
    the sperm forward. \n\nThis is also known as peristalsis. \n\nThe sperm is transferred
    from each vas deferens into the urethra, partially mixing with secretions from
    the male accessory sex glands such as the seminal vesicles, prostate gland and
    the bulbourethral glands, which form the bulk of semen.\n\n\n== Clinical significance
    ==\n\n\n\n=== Contraception ===\n\nA vasectomy is a method of contraception in
    which the vasa deferentia are permanently cut, though in some cases it can be
    reversed. \n\nA modern variation, which is also known as a vasectomy even though
    it does not include cutting the vas, involves injecting an obstructive material
    into the ductus to block the flow of sperm.\n\nInvestigational attempts for male
    contraception have focused on the vas with the use of the intra vas device and
    reversible inhibition of sperm under guidance.\n\n\n=== Disease ===\n\nThe vas
    deferens may be obstructed, or it may be completely absent in a condition known
    as congenital absence of the vas deferens (CAVD, a potential feature of cystic
    fibrosis), causing male infertility. \n\nAcquired obstructions can occur due
    to infections. \n\nTo treat these causes of male infertility, sperm can be harvested
    by testicular sperm extraction (TESE), microsurgical epididymal sperm aspiration
    (MESA), or other methods of collecting sperm cells directly from the testicle
    or epididymis.\n\n\n=== Uses in pharmacology and physiology ===\n\nThe vas deferens
    has a dense sympathetic innervation, making it a useful system for studying sympathetic
    nerve function and for studying drugs that modify neurotransmission.It has been
    used:\n\n-as a bioassay for the discovery of enkephalins, the endogenous opiates.\n\n-to
    demonstrate quantal transmission from sympathetic nerve terminals.\n\n-as the
    first direct measure of free Ca2+ concentration in a postganglionic nerve terminal.\n\n-to
    develop an optical method for monitoring packeted transmission (similar to quantal
    transmission).\n\n\n== Other animals ==\n\nMost vertebrates have some form of
    duct to transfer the sperm from the testes to the urethra. \n\nIn cartilaginous
    fish and amphibians, sperm is carried through the archinephric duct, which also
    partially helps to transport urine from the kidneys. \n\nIn teleosts, there is
    a distinct sperm duct, separate from the ureters, and often called the vas deferens,
    although probably not truly homologous with that in humans. \n\nThe vas deferens
    loops over the ureter in placental mammals, but not in marsupial mammals.\n\nIn
    cartilaginous fishes, the part of the archinephric duct closest to the testis
    is coiled up to form an epididymis. \n\nBelow this are a number of small glands
    secreting components of the seminal fluid. \n\nThe final portion of the duct
    also receives ducts from the kidneys in most species.In amniotes, however, the
    archinephric duct has become a true vas deferens, and is used only for conducting
    sperm, never urine. \n\nAs in cartilaginous fish, the upper part of the duct
    forms the epididymis. \n\nIn many species, the vas deferens ends in a small sac
    for storing sperm.The only vertebrates to lack any structure resembling a vas
    deferens are the primitive jawless fishes, which release sperm directly into
    the body cavity, and then into the surrounding water through a simple opening
    in the body wall.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vas_deferens"

    SUPERIOR PARATHYROIF GLAND



    The two parathyroid
    glands on each side which are positioned higher are called the superior parathyroid
    glands, while the lower two are called the inferior parathyroid glands.

  descriptionText: "\n\nJEJUNUM\n\n\nThe jejunum is the second part of the small
    intestine in humans and most higher vertebrates, including mammals, reptiles,
    and birds. \n\nIts lining is specialised for the absorption by enterocytes of
    small nutrient molecules which have been previously digested by enzymes in the
    duodenum.\nThe jejunum lies between the duodenum and the ileum and is considered
    to start at the suspensory muscle of the duodenum, a location called the duodenojejunal
    flexure. \n\nThe division between the jejunum and ileum is not anatomically distinct.
    \n\nIn adult humans, the small intestine is usually 6\u20137 m (20\u201323 ft)
    long (post mortem), about two-fifths of which (about 2.5 m (8.2 ft)) is the jejunum.\n\n\n==
    Structure ==\n\n\nThe interior surface of the jejunum\u2014which is exposed to
    ingested food\u2014is covered in finger\u2013like projections of mucosa, called
    villi, which increase the surface area of tissue available to absorb nutrients
    from ingested foodstuffs. \n\nThe epithelial cells which line these villi have
    microvilli. \n\nThe transport of nutrients across epithelial cells through the
    jejunum and ileum includes the passive transport of sugar fructose and the active
    transport of amino acids, small peptides, vitamins, and most glucose. \n\nThe
    villi in the jejunum are much longer than in the duodenum or ileum.\nThe pH in
    the jejunum is usually between 7 and 8 (neutral or slightly alkaline).\nThe jejunum
    and the ileum are suspended by mesentery which gives the bowel great mobility
    within the abdomen. \n\nIt also contains circular and longitudinal smooth muscle
    which helps to move food along by a process known as peristalsis.\n\n\n=== Histology
    ===\n\nThe jejunum contains very few Brunner's glands (found in the duodenum)
    or Peyer's patches (found in the ileum). \n\nHowever, there are a few jejunal
    lymph nodes suspended in its mesentery. \n\nThe jejunum has many large circular
    folds in its submucosa called plicae circulares that which increase the surface
    area for nutrient absorption. \n\nThe plicae circulares are best developed in
    the jejunum.\nThere is no line of demarcation between the jejunum and the ileum.
    \n\nHowever, there are subtle histological differences:\n\nThe jejunum has less
    fat inside its mesentery than the ileum.\nThe jejunum is typically of larger
    diameter than the ileum.\nThe villi of the jejunum look like long, finger-like
    projections, and are a histologically identifiable structure.\nWhile the length
    of the entire intestinal tract contains lymphoid tissue, only the ileum has abundant
    Peyer's patches, which are unencapsulated lymphoid nodules that contain large
    numbers of lymphocytes and immune cells, like microfold cells.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n==
    Function ==\n\nThe lining of the jejunum is specialized for the absorption by
    enterocytes of small nutrient particles which have been previously digested by
    enzymes in the duodenum. \n\nOnce absorbed, nutrients (with the exception of
    fat, which goes to the lymph) pass from the enterocytes into the enterohepatic
    circulation and enter the liver via the hepatic portal vein, where the blood
    is processed.\n\n\n== Other animals ==\n\nIn fish, the divisions of the small
    intestine are not as clear and the terms middle intestine or mid-gut may be used
    instead of jejunum.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n\n=== Etymology ===\n\nJejunum is
    derived from the Latin word j\u0113j\u016Bnus, meaning \"fasting.\" It was so
    called because this part of the small intestine was frequently found to be void
    of food following death, due to its intensive peristaltic activity relative to
    the duodenum and ileum.\nThe Early Modern English adjective jejune is derived
    from the same root.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jejunum"

  descriptionText: "\n\nEPIGLOTTIS\n\n\nThe epiglottis is a leaf-shaped flap in the
    throat that prevents food from entering the windpipe and the lungs. \n\nIt stays
    open during breathing, allowing air into the larynx. \n\nDuring swallowing, it
    closes to prevent aspiration of food into the lungs, forcing the swallowed liquids
    or food to go along the esophagus toward the stomach instead. \n\nIt is thus
    the valve that diverts passage to either the trachea or the esophagus. \n\nThe
    epiglottis is made of elastic cartilage covered with a mucous membrane, attached
    to the entrance of the larynx. \n\nIt projects upwards and backwards behind the
    tongue and the hyoid bone. \n\nThe epiglottis may be inflamed in a condition
    called epiglottitis, which is most commonly due to the vaccine-preventable bacteria
    Haemophilus influenzae. \n\nDysfunction may cause the inhalation of food, called
    aspiration, which may lead to pneumonia or airway obstruction. \n\nThe epiglottis
    is also an important landmark for intubation. \nThe epiglottis has been identified
    as early as Aristotle, and gets its name from being above the glottis (epi- +
    glottis).\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\n\nThe epiglottis sits at the entrance of the
    larynx. \n\nIt is shaped like a leaf of purslane and has a free upper part that
    rests behind the tongue, and a lower stalk (Latin: petiolus). \n\nThe stalk originates
    from the back surface of the thyroid cartilage, connected by a thyroepiglottic
    ligament. \n\nAt the sides, the stalk is connected to the arytenoid cartilages
    at the walls of the larynx by folds.The epiglottis originates at the entrance
    of the larynx, and is attached to the hyoid bone. \n\nFrom there, it projects
    upwards and backwards behind the tongue. \n\nThe space between the epiglottis
    and the tongue is called the vallecula.\n\n\n=== Microanatomy ===\n\nThe epiglottis
    has two surfaces; a forward-facing anterior surface, and a posterior surface
    facing the larynx. \n\nThe forward-facing surface is covered with several layers
    of thin cells (stratified squamous epithelium), and is not covered with keratin,
    the same surface as the back of the tongue. \n\nThe back surface is covered in
    a layer of column-shaped cells with cilia, similar to the rest of the respiratory
    tract. \n\nIt also has mucous-secreting goblet cells. \n\nThere is an intermediate
    zone between these surfaces that contains cells that transition in shape. \n\nThe
    body of the epiglottis consists of elastic cartilage.\n\n\n=== Development ===\n\nThe
    epiglottis arises from the fourth pharyngeal arch. \n\nIt can be seen as a distinct
    structure later than the other cartilage of the pharynx, visible around the fifth
    month of development. \n\nThe position of the epiglottis also changes with ageing.
    \n\nIn infants, it touches the soft palate, whereas in adults, its position is
    lower.\n\n\n=== Variation ===\n\n\nA high-rising epiglottis is a normal anatomical
    variation, visible during an examination of the mouth. \n\nIt does not cause
    any serious problem apart from maybe a mild sensation of a foreign body in the
    throat. \n\nIt is seen more often in children than adults and does not need any
    medical or surgical intervention. \n\nThe front surface of the epiglottis is
    occasionally notched.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\nThe epiglottis is normally pointed
    upward during breathing with its underside functioning as part of the pharynx.
    \n\nThere are taste buds on the epiglottis.\n\n\n=== Swallowing ===\n\nDuring
    swallowing, the epiglottis bends backwards, folding over the entrance to the
    trachea, and preventing food from going into it. \n\nThe folding backwards is
    a complex movement the causes of which are not completely understood. \n\nIt
    is likely that during swallowing the hyoid bone and the larynx move upwards and
    forwards, which increases passive pressure from the back of the tongue; because
    the aryepiglottic muscles contract; because of the passive weight of the food
    pushing down; and because of contraction of laryngeal and because of contraction
    of thyroarytenoid muscles. \n\nThe consequence of this is that during swallowing
    the bent epiglottis blocks off the trachea, preventing food from going into it;
    food instead travels down the esophagus, which is behind it.\n\n\n=== Speech
    sounds ===\n\nIn many languages, the epiglottis is not essential for producing
    sounds. \n\nIn some languages, the epiglottis is used to produce epiglottal consonant
    speech sounds, though this sound-type is rather rare.\n\n\n== Clinical significance
    ==\n\n\n\n=== Inflammation ===\n\n\nInflammation of the epiglottis is known as
    epiglottitis. \n\nEpiglottitis is mainly caused by Haemophilus influenzae. \n\nA
    person with epiglottitis may have a fever, sore throat, difficulty swallowing,
    and difficulty breathing. \n\nFor this reason, acute epiglottitis is considered
    a medical emergency, because of the risk of obstruction of the pharynx. \n\nEpiglottitis
    is often managed with antibiotics, inhaled aerosolised epinephrine to act as
    a bronchodilator, and may require tracheal intubation or a tracheostomy if breathing
    is difficult.\n\nThe incidence of epiglottitis has decreased significantly in
    countries where vaccination against Haemophilus influenzae is administered.\n\n\n===
    Aspiration ===\n\nWhen food or other objects travel down the respiratory tract
    rather than down the esophagus to the stomach, this is called aspiration. \n\nThis
    can lead to airway obstruction, inflammation of lung tissue, and aspiration pneumonia;
    and in the long term, atelectasis and bronchiectasis. \n\nOne reason aspiration
    can occur is because of failure of the epiglottis to close completely.\n\nShould
    food or liquid enter the airway due to the epiglottis failing to close properly,
    throat clearing or the cough reflex may occur to protect the respiratory system
    and expel material from the airway. \n\nWhere there is impairment in laryngeal
    vestibule sensation, silent aspiration (entry of material to the airway that
    does not result in a cough reflex) may occur.\n\n\n=== Other ===\n\nThe epiglottis
    and vallecula are important anatomical landmarks in intubation. \n\nAbnormal
    positioning of the epiglottis is a rare cause of obstructive sleep apnoea.\n\n\n==
    Other animals ==\n\nThe epiglottis is present in mammals, including land mammals
    and cetaceans, also as a cartilaginous structure. \n\nLike in humans, it functions
    to prevent entry of food into the trachea during swallowing. \n\nThe position
    of the larynx is flat in mice and other rodents, including rabbits. \n\nFor this
    reason, because the epiglottis is located behind the soft palate in rabbits,
    they are obligate nose breathers, as are mice and other rodents. \n\nIn rodents
    and mice, there is a unique pouch in front of the epiglottis, and the epiglottis
    is commonly injured by inhaled substances, particularly at the transition zone
    between the flattened and cuboidal epithelium. \n\nIt is also common to see taste
    buds on the epiglottis in these species.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe epiglottis
    was noted by Aristotle, although the epiglottis' function was first defined by
    Vesalius in 1543. \n\nThe word has Greek roots. \n\nThe epiglottis gets its name
    from being above (Ancient Greek: \u1F10\u03C0\u03AF, romanized: epi-) the glottis
    (Ancient Greek: \u03B3\u03BB\u03C9\u03C4\u03C4\u03AF\u03C2, romanized: glottis,
    lit.\u2009'tongue').\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epiglottis"

  descriptionText: "\n\nPANCREATIC DUCT\n\n\nThe pancreatic duct, or duct of Wirsung
    (also, the major pancreatic duct due to the existence of an accessory pancreatic
    duct), is a duct joining the pancreas to the common bile duct. \n\nThis supplies
    it with pancreatic juice from the exocrine pancreas, which aids in digestion.\n\n\n==
    Structure ==\n\nThe pancreatic duct joins the common bile duct just prior to
    the ampulla of Vater, after which both ducts perforate the medial side of the
    second portion of the duodenum at the major duodenal papilla. \n\nThere are many
    anatomical variants reported, but these are quite rare.\n\n\n=== Accessory pancreatic
    duct ===\n\nMost people have just one pancreatic duct. \n\nHowever, some have
    an additional accessory pancreatic duct, also called the Duct of Santorini. \n\nAn
    accessory pancreatic duct can be functional or non-functional. \n\nIt may open
    separately into the second part of the duodenum, which is dorsal, and usually
    (in 70% of people) drains into the duodenum via the minor duodenal papilla. \n\nIn
    the other 30% of people, it drains into the main pancreatic duct, which drains
    into the duodenum via the major duodenal papilla. \n\nThe main pancreatic duct
    and the accessory duct both eventually\u2014either directly or indirectly\u2014connect
    to the second part ('D2', the vertical segment) of the duodenum.\nIt is named
    for Giovanni Domenico Santorini.\n\n\n== Clinical significance ==\n\nCompression,
    obstruction or inflammation of the pancreatic duct may lead to acute pancreatitis.
    \n\nThe most common cause for obstruction is the presence of gallstones in the
    common bile duct, a condition called choledocholithiasis. \n\nObstruction can
    also be due to duodenal inflammation in Crohn's disease. \n\nA gallstone may
    get lodged in the constricted distal end of the ampulla of Vater, where it blocks
    the flow of both bile and pancreatic juice into the duodenum. \n\nBile backing
    up into the pancreatic duct may initiate pancreatitis. \n\nThe pancreatic duct
    is generally regarded as abnormally enlarged if being over 3 mm in the head and
    2 mm in the body or tail.Pancreatic ductal carcinoma is a common form of pancreatic
    cancer.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe pancreatic duct is also called the duct of
    Wirsung. \n\nThis is named after its discoverer, the German anatomist Johann
    Georg Wirsung (1589\u20131643).\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_duct"

  descriptionText: "\n\nSUBMANDIBULAR DUCT\n\n\nThe submandibular duct or Wharton
    duct or submaxillary duct, is one of the salivary excretory ducts. \n\nIt is
    about 5 cm. long, and its wall is much thinner than that of the parotid duct.
    \n\nIt drains saliva from each bilateral submandibular gland and sublingual gland
    to the sublingual caruncle at the base of the tongue.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\n\nThe
    submandibular duct arises from deep part of submandibular gland, a salivary gland.
    \n\nIt begins by numerous branches from the superficial surface of the gland,
    and runs forward between the mylohyoid, hyoglossus, and genioglossus muscles.
    \n\nIt then passes between the sublingual gland and the genioglossus and opens
    by a narrow opening on the summit of a small papilla (the \"sublingual caruncle\")
    at the side of the frenulum of the tongue. \n\nIt lies superior to lingual and
    hypoglossal nerves.\n\n\n=== Variation ===\n\nThe submandibular duct may be duplicated
    on one side or both sides, creating an accessory submandibular duct. \n\nRarely,
    it may not perforate into the mouth.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\nThe submandibular
    ducts drain saliva from the submandibular gland, and the sublingual glands to
    the sublingual caruncles at the base of the tongue.\n\n\n== Clinical significance
    ==\n\n\n=== Sialolithiasis ===\n\nThe submandibular duct may be affected by stones,
    known as sialolithiasis. \n\nThese may grow large, requiring surgery to remove.
    \n\nSimple palpation may be used to identify the location of any stones before
    surgery.\n\n\n=== Imperforate ===\n\nRarely, the submandibular duct may not perforate
    into the mouth. \n\nSurgery may be used to repair this birth defect.\n\n\n===
    Drooling ===\n\nThe exit of the submandibular gland into the mouth may be realigned
    in patients who drool. \n\nThis redirects the exiting saliva away from the vestibule
    and the lips. \n\nThis surgery has a fairly high success rate. \n\nRarely, the
    submandibular gland may need to be removed on one or both sides.\n\n\n== History
    ==\n\nThe submandibular duct was initially described by the English anatomist
    Thomas Wharton ( 1614-73) and is sometimes referred to by his name.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submandibular_duct"

  descriptionText: "\n\nSUBMANDIBULAR GLAND\n\n\nThe paired submandibular glands
    (historically known as submaxillary glands) are major salivary glands located
    beneath the floor of the mouth. \n\nThey each weigh about 15 grams and contribute
    some 60\u201367% of unstimulated saliva secretion; on stimulation their contribution
    decreases in proportion as the parotid secretion rises to 50%. \n\nThe average
    length of the normal human submandibular salivary gland is approximately 27mm,
    while the average width is approximately 14.3mm.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\n\nLying
    superior to the digastric muscles, each submandibular gland is divided into superficial
    and deep lobes, which are separated by the mylohyoid muscle:\nThe superficial
    lobe comprises most of the gland, with the mylohyoid muscle runs under it\nThe
    deep lobe is the smaller partSecretions are delivered into the submandibular
    duct on the deep portion after which they hook around the posterior edge of the
    mylohyoid muscle and proceed on the superior surface laterally. \n\nThe excretory
    ducts are then crossed by the lingual nerve, and ultimately drain into the sublingual
    caruncles \u2013 small prominences on either side of the lingual frenulum along
    with the major sublingual duct. \n\nThe gland can be bilaterally palpated (felt)
    inferior and posterior to the body of the mandible, moving inward from the inferior
    border of the mandible near its angle with the head tilted forwards.\n\n\n===
    Microanatomy ===\n\n\nLobes contain smaller lobules, which contain adenomeres,
    the secretory units of the gland. \n\nEach adenomer contains one or more acini,
    or alveoli, which are small clusters of cells that secrete their products into
    a duct. \n\nThe acini of each adenomere are composed of either serous or mucous
    cells, with serous adenomeres predominating. \n\nSome mucous adenomeres may also
    be capped with a serous demilune, a layer of lysozyme-secreting serous cells
    resembling a half moon.\nLike other exocrine glands, the submandibular gland
    can be classified by the microscopic anatomy of its secretory cells and how they
    are arranged. \n\nBecause the glands are branched, and because the tubules forming
    the branches contain secretory cells, submandibular glands are classified as
    branched tubuloacinar glands. \n\nFurther, because the secretory cells are of
    both serous and mucous types, the submandibular gland is a mixed gland, and though
    most of the cells are serous, the exudate is chiefly mucous. \n\nIt has long
    striated ducts and short intercalated ducts.The secretory acinar cells of the
    submandibular gland have distinct functions. \n\nThe mucous cells are the most
    active and therefore the major product of the submandibular glands is saliva
    which is mucoid in nature. \n\nMucous cells secrete mucin which aids in the lubrication
    of the food bolus as it travels through the esophagus. \n\nIn addition, the serous
    cells produce salivary amylase, which aids in the breakdown of starches in the
    mouth. \n\nThe submandibular gland's highly active acini account for most of
    the salivary volume. \n\nThe parotid and sublingual glands account for the remaining.\n\n\n===
    Blood supply ===\n\nThe gland receives its blood supply from the facial and lingual
    arteries. \n\nThe gland is supplied by sublingual and submental arteries and
    drained by common facial and lingual veins.\n\n\n=== Lymphatic drainage ===\n\nThe
    lymphatics from submandibular gland first drain into submandibular lymph nodes
    and subsequently into jugulo - digastric lymph nodes.\n\n\n=== Nerve supply ===\n\n\nTheir
    secretions, like the secretions of other salivary glands, are regulated directly
    by the parasympathetic nervous system and indirectly by the sympathetic nervous
    system.\n\nParasympathetic innervation to the submandibular glands is provided
    by the superior salivatory nucleus via the chorda tympani, a branch of the facial
    nerve, that becomes part of the trigeminal nerve's lingual nerve prior to synapsing
    on the submandibular ganglion. \n\nIncreased parasympathetic activity promotes
    the secretion of saliva.\nThe sympathetic nervous system regulates submandibular
    secretions through vasoconstriction of the arteries that supply it. \n\nIncreased
    sympathetic activity reduces glandular bloodflow, thereby decreasing the volume
    of fluid in salivary secretions, producing an enzyme rich mucous saliva. \n\nNevertheless,
    direct stimulation of sympathetic nerves will cause an increase in salivary enzymatic
    secretions. \n\nIn sum, the volume decreases, but the secretions are increased
    by parasympathetic and sympathetic innervation.\n\n\n=== Development ===\n\nThe
    submandibular salivary glands develop later than the parotid glands and appear
    late in the sixth week of prenatal development. \n\nThey develop bilaterally
    from epithelial buds in the sulcus surrounding the sublingual folds on the floor
    of the primitive mouth. \n\nSolid cords branch from the buds and grow posteriorly,
    lateral to the developing tongue. \n\nThe cords of the submandibular gland later
    branch further and then become canalized to form the ductal part. \n\nThe submandibular
    gland acini develop from the cords\u2019 rounded terminal ends at 12 weeks, and
    secretory activity via the submandibular duct begins at 16 weeks. \n\nGrowth
    of the submandibular gland continues after birth with the formation of more acini.
    \n\nLateral to both sides of the tongue, a linear groove develops and closes
    over to form the submandibular duct.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\nThe submandibular
    gland releases a host of factors which regulate systemic inflammatory responses
    and modulate systemic immune and inflammatory reactions. \n\nEarly work in identifying
    factors that played a role in the cervical sympathetic trunk-submandibular gland
    (CST-SMG) axis lead to the discovery of a seven amino acid peptide, called the
    submandibular gland peptide-T. \n\nSGP-T was demonstrated to have biological
    activity and thermoregulatory properties related to endotoxin exposure. \n\nSGP-T,
    an isolate of the submandibular gland, demonstrated its immunoregulatory properties
    and potential role in modulating the CST-SMG axis, and subsequently was shown
    to play an important role in the control of inflammation. \n\n\n== Clinical significance
    ==\n\n\nThe submandibular gland accounts for 80% of all salivary duct calculi
    (salivary stones or sialolith), possibly due to the different nature of the saliva
    that it produces and the tortuous travel of the submandibular duct to its ductal
    opening for a considerable upward distance. \n\nThe submandibular gland is one
    of the major three glands that provide the mouth with saliva. \n\nThe\ntwo other
    types of salivary glands are parotid and sublingual glands.\n\n\n=== Dissection

  descriptionText: "\n\nCORPUS CAVERNOSUM OF PENIS\n\n\nA corpus cavernosum penis
    (singular) (literally \"cave-like body\" of the penis, plural corpora cavernosa)
    is one of a pair of sponge-like regions of erectile tissue, which contain most
    of the blood in the penis during an erection.\n\nSuch a corpus is homologous
    to the corpus cavernosum clitoridis in the female; the body of the clitoris that
    contains erectile tissue in a pair of corpora cavernosa with a recognisably similar
    structure.\n\n\n== Anatomy ==\n\nThe two corpora cavernosa and corpus spongiosum
    (also known as the corpus cavernosum urethrae in older texts and in the adjacent
    diagram) are three expandable erectile tissues along the length of the penis,
    which fill with blood during penile erection. \n\nThe two corpora cavernosa lie
    along the penis shaft, from the pubic bones to the head of the penis, where they
    join. \n\nThese formations are made of a sponge-like tissue containing trabeculae,
    irregular blood-filled spaces lined by endothelium and separated by septum of
    the penis.\n\nThe male anatomy has no vestibular bulbs, but instead a corpus
    spongiosum, a smaller region along the bottom of the penis, which contains the
    urethra and forms the glans penis.\n\n\n== Physiology ==\n\nIn some circumstances,
    release of nitric oxide precedes relaxation of muscles in the corpora cavernosa
    and corpus spongiosum, in a process similar to female arousal. \n\nThe spongy
    tissue fills with blood, from arteries down the length of the penis. \n\nA little
    blood enters the corpus spongiosum; the remainder engorges the corpora cavernosa,
    which expand to hold 90% of the blood involved in an erection, increasing both
    in length and in diameter. \n\nThe function of the corpus spongiosum is to prevent
    compression of the urethra during erection.\n\nBlood can leave the erectile tissue
    only through a drainage system of veins around the outside wall of the corpus
    cavernosum. \n\nThe expanding spongy tissue presses against a surrounding dense
    tissue (tunica albuginea) constricting these veins, preventing blood from leaving.
    \n\nThe penis becomes rigid as a result. \n\nThe glans penis, the expanded cap
    of the corpus spongiosum, remains more malleable during erection because its
    tunica albuginea is much thinner than elsewhere in the penis.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpus_cavernosum_penis"

  descriptionText: "\n\nASCENDING COLON/\nLARGE INTESTINE\n\n\nThe large intestine,
    also known as the large bowel, is the last part of the gastrointestinal tract
    and of the digestive system in vertebrates. \n\nWater is absorbed here and the
    remaining waste material is stored as feces before being removed by defecation.\n\nThe
    colon is the largest portion of the large intestine, so many mentions of the
    large intestine and colon overlap in meaning whenever precision is not the focus.
    \n\nMost sources define the large intestine as the combination of the cecum,
    colon, rectum, and anal canal. \n\nSome other sources exclude the anal canal.\n\nIn
    humans, the large intestine begins in the right iliac region of the pelvis, just
    at or below the waist, where it is joined to the end of the small intestine at
    the cecum, via the ileocecal valve. \n\nIt then continues as the colon ascending
    the abdomen, across the width of the abdominal cavity as the transverse colon,
    and then descending to the rectum and its endpoint at the anal canal. \n\nOverall,
    in humans, the large intestine is about 1.5 metres (5 ft) long, which is about
    one-fifth of the whole length of the gastrointestinal tract.\n\n\n== Structure
    ==\n\nThe colon is the last part of the digestive system. \n\nIt has a segmented
    appearance due to a series of saccules called haustra. \n\nIt extracts water
    and salt from solid wastes before they are eliminated from the body and is the
    site in which flora-aided (largely bacterial) fermentation of unabsorbed material
    occurs. \n\nUnlike the small intestine, the colon does not play a major role
    in absorption of foods and nutrients. \n\nAbout 1.5 litres or 45 ounces of water
    arrives in the colon each day.The length of the average adult human colon is
    65 inches or 166 cm (range of 80 to 313 cm) for males, and 61 inches or 155 cm
    (range of 80 to 214 cm) for females.\n\n\n=== Sections ===\n\n\nIn mammals, the
    colon consists of six sections: the cecum, the ascending colon, the transverse
    colon, the descending colon, the sigmoid colon, and the rectum.Sections of the
    colon are:\n\nThe cecum including the appendix\nThe ascending colon\nThe transverse
    colon including the colic flexures and transverse mesocolon\nThe descending colon\nThe
    sigmoid colon \u2013 the s-shaped region of the large intestine\nThe rectumThe
    parts of the colon are either intraperitoneal or behind it in the retroperitoneum.
    \n\nRetroperitoneal organs, in general, do not have a complete covering of peritoneum,
    so they are fixed in location. \n\nIntraperitoneal organs are completely surrounded
    by peritoneum and are therefore mobile. \n\nOf the colon, the ascending colon,
    descending colon and rectum are retroperitoneal, while the cecum, appendix, transverse
    colon and sigmoid colon are intraperitoneal. \n\nThis is important as it affects
    which organs can be easily accessed during surgery, such as a laparotomy.\n\nIn
    terms of diameter, the cecum is the widest, averaging slightly less than 9 cm
    in healthy individuals, and the transverse colon averages less than 6 cm in diameter.
    \n\nThe descending and sigmoid colon are slightly smaller, with the sigmoid colon
    averaging 4\u20135 cm (1.6\u20132.0 in) in diameter. \n\nDiameters larger than
    certain thresholds for each colonic section can be diagnostic for megacolon.\n\n\n====
    Cecum and appendix ====\n\nThe cecum is the first section of the colon and involved
    in the digestion, while the appendix which develops embryologically from it,
    is a structure of the colon, not involved in digestion and considered to be part
    of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue. \n\nThe function of the appendix is uncertain,
    but some sources believe that the appendix has a role in housing a sample of
    the colon's microflora, and is able to help to repopulate the colon with bacteria
    if the microflora has been damaged during the course of an immune reaction. \n\nThe
    appendix has also been shown to have a high concentration of lymphatic cells.\n\n\n====
    Ascending colon ====\n\nThe ascending colon is the first of four main sections
    of the large intestine. \n\nIt is connected to the small intestine by a section
    of bowel called the cecum. \n\nThe ascending colon runs upwards through the abdominal
    cavity toward the transverse colon for approximately eight inches (20 cm).\n\nOne
    of the main functions of the colon is to remove the water and other key nutrients
    from waste material and recycle it. \n\nAs the waste material exits the small
    intestine through the ileocecal valve, it will move into the cecum and then to
    the ascending colon where this process of extraction starts. \n\nThe waste material
    is pumped upwards toward the transverse colon by peristalsis. \n\nThe ascending
    colon is sometimes attached to the appendix via Gerlach's valve. \n\nIn ruminants,
    the ascending colon is known as the spiral colon.\nTaking into account all ages
    and sexes, colon cancer occurs here most often (41%).\n\n\n==== Transverse colon
    ====\n\nThe transverse colon is the part of the colon from the hepatic flexure,
    also known as the right colic, (the turn of the colon by the liver) to the splenic
    flexure also known as the left colic, (the turn of the colon by the spleen).
    \n\nThe transverse colon hangs off the stomach, attached to it by a large fold
    of peritoneum called the greater omentum. \n\nOn the posterior side, the transverse
    colon is connected to the posterior abdominal wall by a mesentery known as the
    transverse mesocolon.\n\nThe transverse colon is encased in peritoneum, and is
    therefore mobile (unlike the parts of the colon immediately before and after
    it).\n\nThe proximal two-thirds of the transverse colon is perfused by the middle
    colic artery, a branch of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA), while the latter
    third is supplied by branches of the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA). \n\nThe
    \"watershed\" area between these two blood supplies, which represents the embryologic
    division between the midgut and hindgut, is an area sensitive to ischemia.\n\n\n====
    Descending colon ====\n\nThe descending colon is the part of the colon from the
    splenic flexure to the beginning of the sigmoid colon. \n\nOne function of the
    descending colon in the digestive system is to store feces that will be emptied
    into the rectum. \n\nIt is retroperitoneal in two-thirds of humans. \n\nIn the
    other third, it has a (usually short) mesentery. \n\nThe arterial supply comes
    via the left colic artery. \n\nThe descending colon is also called the distal
    gut, as it is further along the gastrointestinal tract than the proximal gut.
    \n\nGut flora are very dense in this region.\n\n\n==== Sigmoid colon ====\n\nThe
    sigmoid colon is the part of the large intestine after the descending colon and
    before the rectum. \n\nThe name sigmoid means S-shaped (see sigmoid; cf. sigmoid
    sinus). \n\nThe walls of the sigmoid colon are muscular and contract to increase
    the pressure inside the colon, causing the stool to move into the rectum.\n\nThe
    sigmoid colon is supplied with blood from several branches (usually between 2
    and 6) of the sigmoid arteries, a branch of the IMA. \n\nThe IMA terminates as
    the superior rectal artery.\n\nSigmoidoscopy is a common diagnostic technique
    used to examine the sigmoid colon.\n\n\n==== Rectum ====\n\nThe rectum is the
    last section of the large intestine. \n\nIt holds the formed feces awaiting elimination
    via defecation.\nIt is about 12 cm long.\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\n\nThe cecum
    \u2013 the first part of the large intestine\n\nTaeniae coli \u2013 three bands
    of smooth muscle\nHaustra \u2013 bulges caused by contraction of taeniae coli\nEpiploic
    appendages \u2013 small fat accumulations on the visceraThe taenia coli run the
    length of the large intestine. \n\nBecause the taenia coli are shorter than the
    large bowel itself, the colon becomes sacculated, forming the haustra of the
    colon which are the shelf-like intraluminal projections.\n\n\n=== Blood supply
    ===\n\nArterial supply to the colon comes from branches of the superior mesenteric
    artery (SMA) and inferior mesenteric artery (IMA). \n\nFlow between these two
    systems communicates via the marginal artery of the colon that runs parallel
    to the colon for its entire length. \n\nHistorically, a structure variously identified
    as the arc of Riolan or meandering mesenteric artery (of Moskowitz) was thought
    to connect the proximal SMA to the proximal IMA. \n\nThis variably present structure
    would be important if either vessel were occluded. \n\nHowever, at least one
    review of the literature questions the existence of this vessel, with some experts
    calling for the abolition of these terms from future medical literature.\n\nVenous
    drainage usually mirrors colonic arterial supply, with the inferior mesenteric
    vein draining into the splenic vein, and the superior mesenteric vein joining
    the splenic vein to form the hepatic portal vein that then enters the liver.\n\n\n===
    Lymphatic drainage ===\n\nLymphatic drainage from the ascending colon and proximal
    two-thirds of the transverse colon is to the colic lymph nodes and the superior
    mesenteric lymph nodes, which drain into the cisterna chyli. \n\nThe lymph from
    the distal one-third of the transverse colon, the descending colon, the sigmoid
    colon, and the upper rectum drain into the inferior mesenteric and colic lymph
    nodes. \n\nThe lower rectum to the anal canal above the pectinate line drain
    to the internal iliac nodes. \n\nThe anal canal below the pectinate line drains
    into the superficial inguinal nodes. \n\nThe pectinate line only roughly marks
    this transition.\n\n\n=== Nerve supply ===\n\nSympathetic supply : Superior &
    inferior mesenteric ganglia\nParasympathetic supply : Vagus & pelvic nerves\n\n\n===
    Development ===\n\n=== Variation ===\n\nOne variation on the normal anatomy of
    the colon occurs when extra loops form, resulting in a colon that is up to five
    metres longer than normal. \n\nThis condition, referred to as redundant colon,
    typically has no direct major health consequences, though rarely volvulus occurs,
    resulting in obstruction and requiring immediate medical attention. \n\nA significant
    indirect health consequence is that use of a standard adult colonoscope is difficult
    and in some cases impossible when a redundant colon is present, though specialized
    variants on the instrument (including the pediatric variant) are useful in overcoming
    this problem.\n\n\n== Microanatomy ==\n\n=== Colonic crypts ===\n\n\nThe wall
    of the large intestine is lined with simple columnar epithelium with invaginations.
    \n\nThe invaginations are called the intestinal glands or colonic crypts.\n\n\t\t\nThe
    colon crypts are shaped like microscopic thick walled test tubes with a central
    hole down the length of the tube (the crypt lumen). \n\nFour tissue sections
    are shown here, two cut across the long axes of the crypts and two cut parallel
    to the long axes. \n\nIn these images the cells have been stained by immunohistochemistry
    to show a brown-orange color if the cells produce a mitochondrial protein called
    cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (CCOI). \n\nThe nuclei of the cells (located at
    the outer edges of the cells lining the walls of the crypts) are stained blue-gray
    with haematoxylin. \n\nAs seen in panels C and D, crypts are about 75 to about
    110 cells long. \n\nBaker et al. found that the average crypt circumference is
    23 cells. \n\nThus, by the images shown here, there are an average of about 1,725
    to 2,530 cells per colonic crypt. \n\nNooteboom et al. measuring the number of
    cells in a small number of crypts reported a range of 1,500 to 4,900 cells per
    colonic crypt. \n\nCells are produced at the crypt base and migrate upward along
    the crypt axis before being shed into the colonic lumen days later. \n\nThere
    are 5 to 6 stem cells at the bases of the crypts.As estimated from the image
    in panel A, there are about 100 colonic crypts per square millimeter of the colonic
    epithelium. \n\nSince the average length of the human colon is 160.5 cm and the
    average inner circumference of the colon is 6.2 cm, the inner surface epithelial
    area of the human colon has an average area of about 995 cm2, which includes
    9,950,000 (close to 10 million) crypts.\n\nIn the four tissue sections shown
    here, many of the intestinal glands have cells with a mitochondrial DNA mutation
    in the CCOI gene and appear mostly white, with their main color being the blue-gray
    staining of the nuclei. \n\nAs seen in panel B, a portion of the stem cells of
    three crypts appear to have a mutation in CCOI, so that 40% to 50% of the cells
    arising from those stem cells form a white segment in the cross cut area.\n\nOverall,
    the percent of crypts deficient for CCOI is less than 1% before age 40, but then
    increases linearly with age. \n\nColonic crypts deficient for CCOI in women reaches,
    on average, 18% in women and 23% in men by 80\u201384 years of age.Crypts of
    the colon can reproduce by fission, as seen in panel C, where a crypt is fissioning
    to form two crypts, and in panel B where at least one crypt appears to be fissioning.
    \n\nMost crypts deficient in CCOI are in clusters of crypts (clones of crypts)
    with two or more CCOI-deficient crypts adjacent to each other (see panel D).\n\n\n====
    Mucosa ====\n\nAbout 150 of the many thousands of protein coding genes expressed
    in the large intestine, some are specific to the mucous membrane in different
    regions and include CEACAM7.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\n\nThe large intestine absorbs
    water and any remaining absorbable nutrients from the food before sending the
    indigestible matter to the rectum. \n\nThe colon absorbs vitamins that are created
    by the colonic bacteria, such as thiamine, riboflavin, and vitamin K (especially
    important as the daily ingestion of vitamin K is not normally enough to maintain
    adequate blood coagulation). \n\nIt also compacts feces, and stores fecal matter
    in the rectum until it can be discharged via the anus in defecation.\n\nThe large
    intestine also secretes K+ and Cl-. \n\nChloride secretion increases in cystic
    fibrosis.\nRecycling of various nutrients takes place in colon. \n\nExamples
    include fermentation of carbohydrates, short chain fatty acids, and urea cycling.\n\nThe
    appendix contains a small amount of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue which gives
    the appendix an undetermined role in immunity. \n\nHowever, the appendix is known
    to be important in fetal life as it contains endocrine cells that release biogenic
    amines and peptide hormones important for homeostasis during early growth and
    development. \n\nThe appendix can be removed with no apparent damage or consequence
    to the patient.By the time the chyme has reached this tube, most nutrients and
    90% of the water have been absorbed by the body. \n\nAt this point some electrolytes
    like sodium, magnesium, and chloride are left as well as indigestible parts of
    ingested food (e.g., a large part of ingested amylose, starch which has been
    shielded from digestion heretofore, and dietary fiber, which is largely indigestible
    carbohydrate in either soluble or insoluble form). \n\nAs the chyme moves through
    the large intestine, most of the remaining water is removed, while the chyme
    is mixed with mucus and bacteria (known as gut flora), and becomes feces. \n\nThe
    ascending colon receives fecal material as a liquid. \n\nThe muscles of the colon
    then move the watery waste material forward and slowly absorb all the excess
    water, causing the stools to gradually solidify as they move along into the descending
    colon.\n\nThe bacteria break down some of the fiber for their own nourishment
    and create acetate, propionate, and butyrate as waste products, which in turn
    are used by the cell lining of the colon for nourishment. \n\nNo protein is made
    available. \n\nIn humans, perhaps 10% of the undigested carbohydrate thus becomes
    available, though this may vary with diet; in other animals, including other
    apes and primates, who have proportionally larger colons, more is made available,
    thus permitting a higher portion of plant material in the diet. \n\nThe large
    intestine produces no digestive enzymes \u2014 chemical digestion is completed
    in the small intestine before the chyme reaches the large intestine. \n\nThe
    pH in the colon varies between 5.5 and 7 (slightly acidic to neutral).\n\n\n===
    Standing gradient osmosis ===\n\nWater absorption at the colon typically proceeds
    against a transmucosal osmotic pressure gradient. \n\nThe standing gradient osmosis
    is the reabsorption of water against the osmotic gradient in the intestines.
    \n\nCells occupying the intestinal lining pump sodium ions into the intercellular
    space, raising the osmolarity of the intercellular fluid. \n\nThis hypertonic
    fluid creates an osmotic pressure that drives water into the lateral intercellular
    spaces by osmosis via tight junctions and adjacent cells, which then in turn
    moves across the basement membrane and into the capillaries, while more sodium
    ions are pumped again into the intercellular fluid. \n\nAlthough water travels
    down an osmotic gradient in each individual step, overall, water usually travels
    against the osmotic gradient due to the pumping of sodium ions into the intercellular
    fluid. \n\nThis allows the large intestine to absorb water despite the blood
    in capillaries being hypotonic compared to the fluid within the intestinal lumen.\n\n\n===
    Gut flora ===\n\n\nThe large intestine houses over 700 species of bacteria that
    perform a variety of functions, as well as fungi, protozoa, and archaea. \n\nSpecies
    diversity varies by geography and diet. \n\nThe microbes in a human distal gut
    often number in the vicinity of 100 trillion, and can weigh around 200 grams
    (0.44 pounds). \n\nThis mass of mostly symbiotic microbes has recently been called
    the latest human organ to be \"discovered\" or in other words, the \"forgotten
    organ\".\n\nThe large intestine absorbs some of the products formed by the bacteria
    inhabiting this region. \n\nUndigested polysaccharides (fiber) are metabolized
    to short-chain fatty acids by bacteria in the large intestine and absorbed by
    passive diffusion. \n\nThe bicarbonate that the large intestine secretes helps
    to neutralize the increased acidity resulting from the formation of these fatty
    acids.\n\nThese bacteria also produce large amounts of vitamins, especially vitamin
    K and biotin (a B vitamin), for absorption into the blood. \n\nAlthough this
    source of vitamins, in general, provides only a small part of the daily requirement,
    it makes a significant contribution when dietary vitamin intake is low. \n\nAn
    individual who depends on absorption of vitamins formed by bacteria in the large
    intestine may become vitamin-deficient if treated with antibiotics that inhibit
    the vitamin producing species of bacteria as well as the intended disease-causing
    bacteria.Other bacterial products include gas (flatus), which is a mixture of
    nitrogen and carbon dioxide, with small amounts of the gases hydrogen, methane,
    and hydrogen sulfide. \n\nBacterial fermentation of undigested polysaccharides
    produces these. \n\nSome of the fecal odor is due to indoles, metabolized from
    the amino acid tryptophan. \n\nThe normal flora is also essential in the development
    of certain tissues, including the cecum and lymphatics.\n\nThey are also involved
    in the production of cross-reactive antibodies. \n\nThese are antibodies produced
    by the immune system against the normal flora, that are also effective against
    related pathogens, thereby preventing infection or invasion.\n\nThe two most
    prevalent phyla of the colon are firmicutes and bacteroidetes. \n\nThe ratio
    between the two seems to vary widely as reported by the Human Microbiome Project.
    \n\nBacteroides are implicated in the initiation of colitis and colon cancer.
    \n\nBifidobacteria are also abundant, and are often described as 'friendly bacteria'.A
    mucus layer protects the large intestine from attacks from colonic commensal
    bacteria.\n\n\n== Clinical significance ==\n\n=== Disease ===\n\n\nFollowing
    are the most common diseases or disorders of the colon:\n\n\n=== Colonoscopy
    ===\n\n\nColonoscopy is the endoscopic examination of the large intestine and
    the distal part of the small bowel with a CCD camera or a fiber optic camera
    on a flexible tube passed through the anus. \n\nIt can provide a visual diagnosis
    (e.g. ulceration, polyps) and grants the opportunity for biopsy or removal of
    suspected colorectal cancer lesions. \n\nColonoscopy can remove polyps as small
    as one millimetre or less. \n\nOnce polyps are removed, they can be studied with
    the aid of a microscope to determine if they are precancerous or not. \n\nIt
    takes 15 years or less for a polyp to turn cancerous.\nColonoscopy is similar
    to sigmoidoscopy\u2014the difference being related to which parts of the colon
    each can examine. \n\nA colonoscopy allows an examination of the entire colon
    (1200\u20131500 mm in length). \n\nA sigmoidoscopy allows an examination of the
    distal portion (about 600 mm) of the colon, which may be sufficient because benefits
    to cancer survival of colonoscopy have been limited to the detection of lesions
    in the distal portion of the colon.\n\nA sigmoidoscopy is often used as a screening
    procedure for a full colonoscopy, often done in conjunction with a stool-based
    test such as a fecal occult blood test (FOBT), fecal immunochemical test (FIT),
    or multi-target stool DNA test (Cologuard) or blood-based test, SEPT9 DNA methylation
    test (Epi proColon). \n\nAbout 5% of these screened patients are referred to
    colonoscopy.\n\nVirtual colonoscopy, which uses 2D and 3D imagery reconstructed
    from computed tomography (CT) scans or from nuclear magnetic resonance (MR) scans,
    is also possible, as a totally non-invasive medical test, although it is not
    standard and still under investigation regarding its diagnostic abilities. \n\nFurthermore,
    virtual colonoscopy does not allow for therapeutic maneuvers such as polyp/tumour
    removal or biopsy nor visualization of lesions smaller than 5 millimeters. \n\nIf
    a growth or polyp is detected using CT colonography, a standard colonoscopy would
    still need to be performed. \n\nAdditionally, surgeons have lately been using
    the term pouchoscopy to refer to a colonoscopy of the ileo-anal pouch.\n\n\n==
    Other animals ==\n\nThe large intestine is truly distinct only in tetrapods,
    in which it is almost always separated from the small intestine by an ileocaecal
    valve. \n\nIn most vertebrates, however, it is a relatively short structure running
    directly to the anus, although noticeably wider than the small intestine. \n\nAlthough
    the caecum is present in most amniotes, only in mammals does the remainder of
    the large intestine develop into a true colon.\n\nIn some small mammals, the
    colon is straight, as it is in other tetrapods, but, in the majority of mammalian
    species, it is divided into ascending and descending portions; a distinct transverse
    colon is typically present only in primates. \n\nHowever, the taeniae coli and
    accompanying haustra are not found in either carnivorans or ruminants. \n\nThe
    rectum of mammals (other than monotremes) is derived from the cloaca of other
    vertebrates, and is, therefore, not truly homologous with the \"rectum\" found
    in these species.\n\nIn fish, there is no true large intestine, but simply a
    short rectum connecting the end of the digestive part of the gut to the cloaca.
    \n\nIn sharks, this includes a rectal gland that secretes salt to help the animal
    maintain osmotic balance with the seawater. \n\nThe gland somewhat resembles
    a caecum in structure but is not a homologous structure.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_intestine"

  descriptionText: "\n\nLESSER OMENTUM\n\n\nThe lesser omentum (small omentum or
    gastrohepatic omentum) is the double layer of peritoneum that extends from the
    liver to the lesser curvature of the stomach, and to the first part of the duodenum.
    \n\nThe lesser omentum is usually divided into these two connecting parts: the
    hepatogastric ligament, and the hepatoduodenal ligament.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\n\nThe
    lesser omentum is extremely thin, and is continuous with the two layers of peritoneum
    which cover respectively the antero-superior and postero-inferior surfaces of
    the stomach and first part of the duodenum.\nWhen these two layers reach the
    lesser curvature of the stomach and the upper border of the duodenum, they join
    together and ascend as a double fold to the porta hepatis.\nTo the left of the
    porta, the fold is attached to the bottom of the fossa for the ductus venosus,
    along which it is carried to the diaphragm, where the two layers separate to
    embrace the end of the esophagus.\nAt the right border of the lesser omentum,
    the two layers are continuous, and form a free margin which constitutes the anterior
    boundary of the omental foramen.\n\n\n== Divisions ==\n\nAnatomically, the lesser
    omentum is divided into ligaments, each starting with the prefix \"hepato\" to
    indicate that it connects to the liver at one end.\nMost sources divide it into
    two parts:\nhepatogastric ligament: the portion connecting to the lesser curvature
    of the stomach\nhepatoduodenal ligament: the portion connecting to the duodenumIn
    some cases, the following ligaments are considered part of the lesser omentum:\n\nhepatophrenic
    ligament: the portion connecting to the thoracic diaphragm\nhepatoesophageal
    ligament: the portion connecting to the esophagus\nhepatocolic ligament: the
    portion connecting to the colon\n\n\n== Contents ==\n\nBetween the two layers
    of the lesser omentum, close to the right free margin, are the hepatic artery
    proper, the common bile duct, the portal vein, lymphatics, and the hepatic plexus
    of nerves\u2014all these structures being enclosed in a fibrous capsule (Glisson's
    capsule).\nBetween the layers of the lesser omentum, where they are attached
    to the stomach, run the right and left gastric arteries, as well as the gastric
    veins.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesser_omentum"

  descriptionText: The accessory parotid gland is a normal, but less common, salivary
    gland tissue located near the main parotid gland, typically anterior and separate
    from it. It's usually found along an imaginary line extending from the tragus
    of the ear to a point midway between the ala of the nose and the vermilion border
    of the lip, lying on the masseter muscle. This gland has its own duct that empties
    into the main parotid duct (Stensen's duct). While the accessory parotid gland
    itself is a common anatomical variant, tumors arising from it

  descriptionText: "\n\nEJACULATORY DUCT\n\n\nThe ejaculatory ducts (ductus ejaculatorii)
    are paired structures in male anatomy. \n\nEach ejaculatory duct is formed by
    the union of the vas deferens with the duct of the seminal vesicle. \n\nThey
    pass through the prostate, and open into the urethra above the seminal colliculus.
    \n\nDuring ejaculation, semen passes through the prostate gland, enters the urethra
    and exits the body via the urinary meatus.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\n\n\n=== Ejaculation
    ===\n\n\nEjaculation occurs in two stages, the emission stage and the expulsion
    stage. \n\nThe emission stage involves the workings of several structures of
    the ejaculatory duct; contractions of the prostate gland, the seminal vesicles,
    the bulbourethral gland and the vas deferens push fluids into the prostatic urethra.
    \n\nThe semen is stored here until ejaculation occurs. \n\nMuscles at the base
    of the penis contract in order to propel the seminal fluid trapped in the prostatic
    urethra through the penile urethra and expel it through the urinary meatus. \n\nThe
    ejaculate is expelled in spurts, due to the movement of the muscles propelling
    it. \n\nThese muscle contractions are related to the sensations of orgasm for
    the male.Sperm is produced in the testes and enters the ejaculatory ducts via
    the vas deferens. \n\nAs it passes by the seminal vesicles, a fluid rich in fructose
    combines with sperm. \n\nThis addition nourishes the sperm in order to keep it
    active and motile. \n\nSeminal fluid continues down the ejaculatory duct into
    the prostate gland, where an alkaline prostatic fluid is added. \n\nThis addition
    provides the texture and odor associated with semen. \n\nThe alkalinity of the
    prostatic fluid serves to neutralize the acidity of the female vaginal tract
    in order to prolong the survival of sperm in this harsh environment. \n\nSemen
    is now a fructose-rich, alkaline fluid containing sperm as it enters the bulbourethral
    glands below the prostate. \n\nThe bulbourethral glands secrete a small amount
    of clear fluid into the urethra before the ejaculate is expelled. \n\nThe functions
    of this fluid are not entirely known but are suggested to aid in lubricating
    the male urethra in preparation for the semen during ejaculation. \n\nThe amount
    of semen produced and expelled during ejaculation corresponds to the length of
    time that the male is sexually aroused before ejaculation occurs. \n\nGenerally,
    the longer the period of arousal, the larger the amount of seminal fluid.Ejaculation
    and orgasm may occur simultaneously, however they are not coupled, in that one
    may occur without the other. \n\nFor example, a man may have a dry orgasm (termed
    Retrograde ejaculation); there is no expulsion of ejaculate however the man still
    experiences orgasm. \n\nAlso, paraplegics may ejaculate seminal fluid but not
    experience the sensation of orgasm.\n\n\n== Clinical relevance ==\n\n\n\n===
    Ejaculatory duct obstruction ===\n\n\nEjaculatory duct obstruction is an acquired
    or congenital pathological condition in which one or both ejaculatory ducts are
    obstructed. \n\nIn the case that both ejaculatory ducts are obstructed, this
    illness presents with the symptoms of aspermia and male infertility.,\n\n\n===
    Benign prostatic hyperplasia ===\n\n\nSurgery to correct benign prostatic hyperplasia
    may destroy these ducts resulting in retrograde ejaculation. \n\nRetrograde ejaculation
    empties the seminal fluid formed in the emission phase into the bladder of the
    male instead of expelling it through the urethra and out the tip of the penis.
    \n\nThis results in a dry orgasm, where orgasm may still be experienced but without
    expulsion of semen from the ejaculatory ducts.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejaculatory_duct"

  descriptionText: "\n\nPINEAL GLAND\n\n\nThe pineal gland, conarium, or epiphysis
    cerebri, is a small endocrine gland in the brain of most vertebrates. \n\nThe
    pineal gland produces melatonin, a serotonin-derived hormone which modulates
    sleep patterns in both circadian and seasonal cycles. \n\nThe shape of the gland
    resembles a pine cone, which gives it its name. \n\nThe pineal gland is located
    in the epithalamus, near the center of the brain, between the two hemispheres,
    tucked in a groove where the two halves of the thalamus join. \n\nThe pineal
    gland is one of the neuroendocrine secretory circumventricular organs in which
    capillaries are mostly permeable to solutes in the blood.Nearly all vertebrate
    species possess a pineal gland. \n\nThe most important exception is a primitive
    vertebrate, the hagfish. \n\nEven in the hagfish, however, there may be a \"pineal
    equivalent\" structure in the dorsal diencephalon. \n\nThe lancelet Branchiostoma
    lanceolatum, the nearest existing relative to vertebrates, also lacks a recognizable
    pineal gland. \n\nThe lamprey (another primitive vertebrate), however, does possess
    one. \n\nA few more complex vertebrates have lost pineal glands over the course
    of their evolution.The results of various scientific research in evolutionary
    biology, comparative neuroanatomy and neurophysiology have explained the evolutionary
    history (phylogeny) of the pineal gland in different vertebrate species. \n\nFrom
    the point of view of biological evolution, the pineal gland is a kind of atrophied
    photoreceptor. \n\nIn the epithalamus of some species of amphibians and reptiles,
    it is linked to a light-sensing organ, known as the parietal eye, which is also
    called the pineal eye or third eye.Ren\xE9 Descartes believed the human pineal
    gland to be the \"principal seat of the soul.\" Academic philosophy among his
    contemporaries considered the pineal gland as a neuroanatomical structure without
    special metaphysical qualities; science studied it as one endocrine gland among
    many.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe word pineal, from Latin pinea (pine-cone),
    was first used in the late 17th century to refer to the cone shape of the brain
    gland.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe pineal gland is a midline brain structure
    that is unpaired. \n\nIt takes its name from its pine-cone shape. \n\nThe gland
    is reddish-gray and about the size of a grain of rice (5\u20138 mm) in humans.
    \n\nThe pineal gland, also called the pineal body, is part of the epithalamus,
    and lies between the laterally positioned thalamic bodies and behind the habenular
    commissure. \n\nIt is located in the quadrigeminal cistern near to the corpora
    quadrigemina. \n\nIt is also located behind the third ventricle and is bathed
    in cerebrospinal fluid supplied through a small pineal recess of the third ventricle
    which projects into the stalk of the gland.\n\n\n=== Blood supply ===\n\nUnlike
    most of the mammalian brain, the pineal gland is not isolated from the body by
    the blood\u2013brain barrier system; it has profuse blood flow, second only to
    the kidney, supplied from the choroidal branches of the posterior cerebral artery.\n\n\n===
    Nerve supply ===\n\nThe pineal gland receives a sympathetic innervation from
    the superior cervical ganglion. \n\nA parasympathetic innervation from the pterygopalatine
    and otic ganglia is also present. \n\nFurther, some nerve fibers penetrate into
    the pineal gland via the pineal stalk (central innervation). \n\nAlso, neurons
    in the trigeminal ganglion innervate the gland with nerve fibers containing the
    neuropeptide PACAP.\n\n\n=== Microanatomy ===\n\n\nThe pineal body in humans
    consists of a lobular parenchyma of pinealocytes surrounded by connective tissue
    spaces. \n\nThe gland's surface is covered by a pial capsule.\nThe pineal gland
    consists mainly of pinealocytes, but four other cell types have been identified.
    \n\nAs it is quite cellular (in relation to the cortex and white matter), it
    may be mistaken for a neoplasm.\n\n\n=== Development ===\n\nThe human pineal
    gland grows in size until about 1\u20132 years of age, remaining stable thereafter,
    although its weight increases gradually from puberty onwards. \n\nThe abundant
    melatonin levels in children are believed to inhibit sexual development, and
    pineal tumors have been linked with precocious puberty. \n\nWhen puberty arrives,
    melatonin production is reduced.\n\n\n=== Symmetry ===\n\nIn the zebrafish the
    pineal gland does not straddle the midline, but shows a left-sided bias. \n\nIn
    humans, functional cerebral dominance is accompanied by subtle anatomical asymmetry.\n\n\n==
    Function ==\n\nOne function of the pineal gland is to produce melatonin. \n\nMelatonin
    has various functions in the central nervous system, the most important of which
    is to help modulate sleep patterns. \n\nMelatonin production is stimulated by
    darkness and inhibited by light. \n\nLight sensitive nerve cells in the retina
    detect light and send this signal to the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), synchronizing
    the SCN to the day-night cycle. \n\nNerve fibers then relay the daylight information
    from the SCN to the paraventricular nuclei (PVN), then to the spinal cord and
    via the sympathetic system to superior cervical ganglia (SCG), and from there
    into the pineal gland.\nThe compound pinoline is also claimed to be produced
    in the pineal gland; it is one of the beta-carbolines. \n\nThis claim is subject
    to some controversy.\n\n\n=== Regulation of the pituitary gland ===\n\nStudies
    on rodents suggest that the pineal gland influences the pituitary gland's secretion
    of the sex hormones, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinizing hormone
    (LH). \n\nPinealectomy performed on rodents produced no change in pituitary weight,
    but caused an increase in the concentration of FSH and LH within the gland. \n\nAdministration
    of melatonin did not return the concentrations of FSH to normal levels, suggesting
    that the pineal gland influences pituitary gland secretion of FSH and LH through
    an undescribed transmitting molecule.The pineal gland contains receptors for
    the regulatory neuropeptide, endothelin-1, which, when injected in picomolar
    quantities into the lateral cerebral ventricle, causes a calcium-mediated increase
    in pineal glucose metabolism.\n\n\n=== Regulation of bone metabolism ===\n\nStudies
    in mice suggest that the pineal-derived melatonin regulates new bone deposition.
    \n\nPineal-derived melatonin mediates its action on the bone cells through MT2
    receptors. \n\nThis pathway could be a potential new target for osteoporosis
    treatment as the study shows the curative effect of oral melatonin treatment
    in a postmenopausal osteoporosis mouse model.\n\n\n== Clinical significance ==\n\n\n\n===
    Calcification ===\n\nCalcification of the pineal gland is typical in young adults,
    and has been observed in children as young as two years of age. \n\nThe internal
    secretions of the pineal gland are known to inhibit the development of the reproductive
    glands because when it is severely damaged in children, development of the sexual
    organs and the skeleton are accelerated. \n\nPineal gland calcification is detrimental
    to its ability to synthesize melatonin and scientific literature presents inconclusive
    findings on whether it causes sleep problems.The calcified gland is often seen
    in skull x-rays. \n\nCalcification rates vary widely by country and correlate
    with an increase in age, with calcification occurring in an estimated 40% of
    Americans by age seventeen. \n\nCalcification of the pineal gland is associated
    with corpora arenacea, also known as \"brain sand\".\n\n\n=== Tumors ===\n\nTumors
    of the pineal gland are called pinealomas. \n\nThese tumors are rare and 50%
    to 70% are germinomas that arise from sequestered embryonic germ cells. \n\nHistologically
    they are similar to testicular seminomas and ovarian dysgerminomas.A pineal tumor
    can compress the superior colliculi and pretectal area of the dorsal midbrain,
    producing Parinaud's syndrome. \n\nPineal tumors also can cause compression of
    the cerebral aqueduct, resulting in a noncommunicating hydrocephalus. \n\nOther
    manifestations are the consequence of their pressure effects and consist of visual
    disturbances, headache, mental deterioration, and sometimes dementia-like behaviour.These
    neoplasms are divided into three categories: pineoblastomas, pineocytomas, and
    mixed tumors, based on their level of differentiation, which, in turn, correlates
    with their neoplastic aggressiveness. \n\nThe clinical course of patients with
    pineocytomas is prolonged, averaging up to several years. \n\nThe position of
    these tumors makes them difficult to remove surgically.\n\n\n=== Other conditions
    ===\n\nThe morphology of the pineal gland differs markedly in different pathological
    conditions. \n\nFor instance, it is known that its volume is reduced both in
    obese patients as well as patients with primary insomnia.\n\n\n== Other animals
    ==\n\nMost living vertebrates have pineal glands. \n\nIt is likely that the common
    ancestor of all vertebrates had a pair of photosensory organs on the top of its
    head, similar to the arrangement in modern lampreys. \n\nSome extinct Devonian
    fishes have two parietal foramina in their skulls, suggesting an ancestral bilaterality
    of parietal eyes. \n\nThe parietal eye and the pineal gland of living tetrapods
    are probably the descendants of the left and right parts of this organ, respectively.During
    embryonic development, the parietal eye and the pineal organ of modern lizards
    and tuataras form together from a pocket formed in the brain ectoderm. \n\nThe
    loss of parietal eyes in many living tetrapods is supported by developmental
    formation of a paired structure that subsequently fuses into a single pineal
    gland in developing embryos of turtles, snakes, birds, and mammals.The pineal
    organs of mammals fall into one of three categories based on shape. \n\nRodents
    have more structurally complex pineal glands than other mammals.Crocodilians
    and some tropical lineages of mammals (some xenarthrans (sloths), pangolins,
    sirenians (manatees and dugongs), and some marsupials (sugar gliders)) have lost
    both their parietal eye and their pineal organ. \n\nPolar mammals, such as walruses
    and some seals, possess unusually large pineal glands.All amphibians have a pineal
    organ, but some frogs and toads also have what is called a \"frontal organ\",
    which is essentially a parietal eye.Pinealocytes in many non-mammalian vertebrates
    have a strong resemblance to the photoreceptor cells of the eye. \n\nEvidence
    from morphology and developmental biology suggests that pineal cells possess
    a common evolutionary ancestor with retinal cells.Pineal cytostructure seems
    to have evolutionary similarities to the retinal cells of the lateral eyes. \n\nModern
    birds and reptiles express the phototransducing pigment melanopsin in the pineal
    gland. \n\nAvian pineal glands are thought to act like the suprachiasmatic nucleus
    in mammals. \n\nThe structure of the pineal eye in modern lizards and tuatara
    is analogous to the cornea, lens, and retina of the lateral eyes of vertebrates.In
    most vertebrates, exposure to light sets off a chain reaction of enzymatic events
    within the pineal gland that regulates circadian rhythms. \n\nIn humans and other
    mammals, the light signals necessary to set circadian rhythms are sent from the
    eye through the retinohypothalamic system to the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN)
    and the pineal gland.\nThe fossilized skulls of many extinct vertebrates have
    a pineal foramen (opening), which in some cases is larger than that of any living
    vertebrate. \n\nAlthough fossils seldom preserve deep-brain soft anatomy, the
    brain of the Russian fossil bird Cerebavis cenomanica from Melovatka, about 90
    million years old, shows a relatively large parietal eye and pineal gland.Rick
    Strassman, an author and Clinical Associate Professor of Psychiatry at the University
    of New Mexico School of Medicine, has theorised that the human pineal gland is
    capable of producing the hallucinogen N,N-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT) under certain
    circumstances. \n\nIn 2013 he and other researchers first reported DMT in the
    pineal gland microdialysate of rodents.\n\n\n== Society and culture ==\n\n\nSeventeenth-century
    philosopher and scientist Ren\xE9 Descartes was highly interested in anatomy
    and physiology. \n\nHe discussed the pineal gland both in his first book, the
    Treatise of Man (written before 1637, but only published posthumously 1662/1664),
    and in his last book, The Passions of the Soul (1649) and he regarded it as \"the
    principal seat of the soul and the place in which all our thoughts are formed.\"
    In the Treatise of Man, Descartes described conceptual models of man, namely
    creatures created by God, which consist of two ingredients, a body and a soul.
    \n\nIn the Passions, Descartes split man up into a body and a soul and emphasized
    that the soul is joined to the whole body by \"a certain very small gland situated
    in the middle of the brain's substance and suspended above the passage through
    which the spirits in the brain's anterior cavities communicate with those in
    its posterior cavities\". \n\nDescartes attached significance to the gland because
    he believed it to be the only section of the brain to exist as a single part
    rather than one-half of a pair. \n\nSome of Descartes's basic anatomical and
    physiological assumptions were totally mistaken, not only by modern standards,
    but also in light of what was already known in his time.The notion of a \"pineal-eye\"
    is central to the philosophy of the French writer Georges Bataille, which is
    analyzed at length by literary scholar Denis Hollier in his study Against Architecture.
    \n\nIn this work Hollier discusses how Bataille uses the concept of a \"pineal-eye\"
    as a reference to a blind-spot in Western rationality, and an organ of excess
    and delirium. \n\nThis conceptual device is explicit in his surrealist texts,
    The Jesuve and The Pineal Eye.In the late 19th century Madame Blavatsky (who
    founded theosophy) identified the pineal gland with the Hindu concept of the
    third eye, or the Ajna chakra. \n\nThis association is still popular today.In
    the short story \"From Beyond\" by H. \n\nP. \n\nLovecraft, a scientist creates
    an electronic device that emits a resonance wave, which stimulates an affected
    person's pineal gland, thereby allowing them to perceive planes of existence
    outside the scope of accepted reality, a translucent, alien environment that
    overlaps our own recognized reality. \n\nIt was adapted as a film of the same
    name in 1986. \n\nThe 2013 horror film Banshee Chapter is heavily influenced
    by this short story.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe secretory activity of the pineal
    gland is only partially understood. \n\nIts location deep in the brain suggested
    to philosophers throughout history that it possesses particular importance. \n\nThis
    combination led to its being regarded as a \"mystery\" gland with mystical, metaphysical,
    and occult theories surrounding its perceived functions.\nThe pineal gland was
    originally believed to be a \"vestigial remnant\" of a larger organ. \n\nIn 1917,
    it was known that extract of cow pineals lightened frog skin. \n\nDermatology
    professor Aaron B. \n\nLerner and colleagues at Yale University, hoping that
    a substance from the pineal might be useful in treating skin diseases, isolated
    and named the hormone melatonin in 1958. \n\nThe substance did not prove to be
    helpful as intended, but its discovery helped solve several mysteries such as
    why removing the rat's pineal accelerated ovary growth, why keeping rats in constant
    light decreased the weight of their pineals, and why pinealectomy and constant
    light affect ovary growth to an equal extent; this knowledge gave a boost to
    the then new field of chronobiology.Of the endocrine organs, the function of
    the pineal gland was the last discovered.\nLocated deep in the center of the
    brain, the pineal gland was once known as the \u201Cthird eye.\u201D\nThe pineal
    gland produces melatonin, which helps maintain circadian rhythm and regulate
    reproductive hormones.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pineal_gland"

  descriptionText: "\n\nTESTIS/\nTESTICLE\n\n\nTesticle or testis (plural testes)
    is the male reproductive gland or gonad in all animals, including humans. \n\nIt
    is homologous to the female ovary. \n\nThe functions of the testes are to produce
    both sperm and androgens, primarily testosterone. \n\nTestosterone release is
    controlled by the anterior pituitary luteinizing hormone, whereas sperm production
    is controlled both by the anterior pituitary follicle-stimulating hormone and
    gonadal testosterone.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\n=== Appearance ===\n\nMales have
    two testicles of similar size contained within the scrotum, which is an extension
    of the abdominal wall. \n\nScrotal asymmetry is not unusual: one testicle extends
    farther down into the scrotum than the other due to differences in the anatomy
    of the vasculature.\n\n\n=== Measurement ===\n\nThe volume of the testicle can
    be estimated by palpating it and comparing it to ellipsoids of known sizes. \n\nAnother
    method is to use calipers (an orchidometer) or a ruler either on the person or
    on an ultrasound image to obtain the three measurements of the x, y, and z axes
    (length, depth and width). \n\nThese measurements can then be used to calculate
    the volume, using the formula for the volume of an ellipsoid: \n\nAn average
    adult testicle measures up to 5 cm \xD7 2 cm \xD7 3 cm (2 in \xD7 3\u20444 in
    \xD7 1+1\u20444 in). \n\nThe Tanner scale for the maturity of male genitals assigns
    a maturity stage to the calculated volume ranging from stage I, a volume of less
    than 1.5 cm3; to stage V, a volume greater than 20 cm3. \n\nNormal volume is
    15 to 25 cm3; the average is 18 cm3 per testis (range 12\u201330 cm3).\n\n\n===
    Internal structure ===\n\n==== Duct system ====\n\nThe testes are covered by
    a tough membranous shell called the tunica albuginea. \n\nWithin the testes are
    very fine coiled tubes called seminiferous tubules. \n\nThe tubules are lined
    with a layer of cells (germ cells) that develop from puberty through old age
    into sperm cells (also known as spermatozoa or male gametes). \n\nThe developing
    sperm travel through the seminiferous tubules to the rete testis located in the
    mediastinum testis, to the efferent ducts, and then to the epididymis where newly
    created sperm cells mature (see spermatogenesis). \n\nThe sperm move into the
    vas deferens, and are eventually expelled through the urethra and out of the
    urethral orifice through muscular contractions.\n\n\n==== Primary cell types
    ====\n\nWithin the seminiferous tubules, the germ cells develop into spermatogonia,
    spermatocytes, spermatids and spermatozoon through the process of spermatogenesis.
    \n\nThe gametes contain DNA for fertilization of an ovum Sertoli cells \u2013
    the true epithelium of the seminiferous epithelium, critical for the support
    of germ cell development into spermatozoa. \n\nSertoli cells secrete inhibin.
    \n\nPeritubular myoid cells surround the seminiferous tubules.Between tubules
    (interstitial cells), exist Leydig cells \u2013 cells localized between seminiferous
    tubules that produce and secrete testosterone and other androgens important for
    sexual development and puberty, secondary sexual characteristics like facial
    hair, sexual behavior and libido. \n\nThey also support spermatogenesis and erectile
    function. \n\nTestosterone controls testicular volume. \nImmature Leydig cells
    and interstitial macrophages and epithelial cells are also present.\n\n\n====
    Blood supply and lymphatic drainage ====\n\nBlood supply and lymphatic drainage
    of the testes and scrotum are distinct:\n\nThe paired testicular arteries arise
    directly from the abdominal aorta and descend through the inguinal canal, while
    the scrotum and the rest of the external genitalia is supplied by the internal
    pudendal artery (itself a branch of the internal iliac artery).\n\nThe testis
    has collateral blood supply from \n1. the cremasteric artery (a branch of the
    inferior epigastric artery, which is a branch of the external iliac artery),
    \nand \n2. the artery to the ductus deferens (a branch of the inferior vesical
    artery, which is a branch of the internal iliac artery). \n\nTherefore, if the
    testicular artery is ligated, e.g., during a Fowler-Stevens orchiopexy for a
    high undescended testis, the testis will usually survive on these other blood
    supplies.\n\nLymphatic drainage of the testes follows the testicular arteries
    back to the paraaortic lymph nodes, while lymph from the scrotum drains to the
    inguinal lymph nodes.\n\n\n==== Layers ====\n\nMany anatomical features of the
    adult testis reflect its developmental origin in the abdomen. \n\nThe layers
    of tissue enclosing each testicle are derived from the layers of the anterior
    abdominal wall. \n\nNotably, the cremasteric muscle arises from the internal
    oblique muscle.\n\n\n==== The blood\u2013testis barrier ====\n\nLarge molecules
    cannot pass from the blood into the lumen of a seminiferous tubule due to the
    presence of tight junctions between adjacent Sertoli cells. \n\nThe spermatogonia
    are in the basal compartment (deep to the level of the tight junctions) and the
    more mature forms such as primary and secondary spermatocytes and spermatids
    are in the adluminal compartment.\n\nThe function of the blood\u2013testis barrier
    may be to prevent an auto-immune reaction. \n\nMature sperm (and their antigens)
    arise long after immune tolerance is established in infancy. \n\nSince sperm
    are antigenically different from self tissue, a male animal can react immunologically
    to his own sperm. \n\nHe is capable of making antibodies against them.\n\nInjection
    of sperm antigens causes inflammation of the testis (auto-immune orchitis) and
    reduced fertility. \n\nThe blood\u2013testis barrier may reduce the likelihood
    that sperm proteins will induce an immune response, reducing fertility and so
    progeny.\n\n\n=== Temperature regulation ===\n\nSpermatogenesis is enhanced at
    temperatures slightly less than core body temperature. \n\nThe spermatogenesis
    is less efficient at lower and higher temperatures than 33 \xB0C. \n\nBecause
    the testes are located outside the body, the smooth tissue of the scrotum can
    move them closer or further away from the body. \n\nThe temperature of the testes
    is maintained at 35 degrees Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit), i.e. two degrees
    below the body temperature of 37 degrees Celsius (98.6 degrees Fahrenheit). \n\nHigher
    temperatures affect spermatogenesis. \n\nThere are a number of mechanisms to
    maintain the testes at the optimum temperature.\n\nThe cremasteric muscle is
    part of the spermatic cord. \n\nWhen this muscle contracts, the cord is shortened
    and the testicle is moved closer up toward the body, which provides slightly
    more warmth to maintain optimal testicular temperature. \n\nWhen cooling is required,
    the cremasteric muscle relaxes and the testicle is lowered away from the warm
    body and is able to cool. \n\nContraction also occurs in response to stress (the
    testicles rise up toward the body in an effort to protect them in a fight).\n\nThe
    cremaster muscle can reflexively raise each testicle individually if properly
    triggered. \n\nThis phenomenon is known as the cremasteric reflex. \n\nThe testicles
    can also be lifted voluntarily using the pubococcygeus muscle, which partially
    activates related muscles.\n\n\n=== Gene and protein expression ===\n\n\nThe
    human genome includes approximately 20,000 protein coding genes: 80% of these
    genes are expressed in adult testes. \n\nThe testes have the highest fraction
    of tissue type-specific genes compared to other organs and tissues: about 1000
    of them are highly specific for the testes, and about 2,200 show an elevated
    pattern of expression here. \n\nA majority of these genes encode for proteins
    that are expressed in the seminiferous tubules and have functions related to
    spermatogenesis. \n\nSperm cells express proteins that result in the development
    of flagella; these same proteins are expressed in the female in cells lining
    the fallopian tube, and cause the development of cilia. \n\nIn other words, sperm
    cell flagella and Fallopian tube cilia are homologous structures. \n\nThe testis-specific
    proteins that show the highest level of expression are protamines.\n\n\n== Development
    ==\n\nThere are two phases in which the testes grow substantially; namely in
    embryonic and pubertal age.\n\n\n=== Embryonic ===\n\n\nDuring mammalian development,
    the gonads are at first capable of becoming either ovaries or testes. \n\nIn
    humans, starting at about week 4 the gonadal rudiments are present within the
    intermediate mesoderm adjacent to the developing kidneys. \n\nAt about week 6,
    sex cords develop within the forming testes. \n\nThese are made up of early Sertoli
    cells that surround and nurture the germ cells that migrate into the gonads shortly
    before sex determination begins. \n\nIn males, the sex-specific gene SRY that
    is found on the Y-chromosome initiates sex determination by downstream regulation
    of sex-determining factors, (such as GATA4, SOX9 and AMH), which leads to development
    of the male phenotype, including directing development of the early bipotential
    gonad down the male path of development.\n\nTestes follow the \"path of descent\"
    from high in the posterior fetal abdomen to the inguinal ring and beyond to the
    inguinal canal and into the scrotum. \n\nIn most cases (97% full-term, 70% preterm),
    both testes have descended by birth. \n\nIn most other cases, only one testis
    fails to descend (cryptorchidism) and that will probably express itself within
    a year.\n\n\n=== Pubertal ===\n\nThe testes grow in response to the start of
    spermatogenesis. \n\nSize depends on lytic function, sperm production (amount
    of spermatogenesis present in testis), interstitial fluid, and Sertoli cell fluid
    production. \n\nAfter puberty, the volume of the testes can be increased by over
    500% as compared to the pre-pubertal size. \n\nTesticles are fully descended
    before one reaches puberty.\n\n\n== Clinical significance ==\n\n=== Protection
    and injury ===\n\n\nThe testicles are well known to be very sensitive to impact
    and injury. \n\nThe pain involved travels up from each testicle into the abdominal
    cavity, via the spermatic plexus, which is the primary nerve of each testicle.
    \n\nThis will cause pain in the hip and the back. \nThe pain usually goes away
    in a few minutes.\n\nTesticular torsion is a medical emergency.\n\nTesticular
    rupture is a medical emergency caused by blunt force impact, sharp edge, or piercing
    impact to one or both testicles, which can lead to necrosis of the testis in
    as little as 30 minutes.\n\nPenetrating injuries to the scrotum may cause castration,
    or physical separation or destruction of the testes, possibly along with part
    or all of the penis, which results in total sterility if the testicles are not
    reattached quickly.\n\nSome jockstraps are designed to provide support to the
    testicles.\n\n\n=== Diseases and conditions ===\n\n-Testicular cancer and other
    neoplasms \u2013 \n\nTo improve the chances of catching possible cases of testicular
    cancer or other health issues early, regular testicular self-examination is recommended.\n\n-Varicocele,
    swollen vein(s) from the testes, usually affecting the left side, the testis
    usually being normal.\n\n-Hydrocele testis, swelling around testes caused by
    accumulation of clear liquid within a membranous sac, the testis usually being
    normal\n\n-Spermatocele, a retention cyst of a tubule of the rete testis or the
    head of the epididymis distended with barely watery fluid that contains spermatozoa.\n\n-Endocrine
    disorders can also affect the size and function of the testis.\n\n-Certain inherited
    conditions involving mutations in key developmental genes also impair testicular
    descent, resulting in abdominal or inguinal testes which remain nonfunctional
    and may become cancerous. \n\n-Other genetic conditions can result in the loss
    of the Wolffian ducts and allow for the persistence of M\xFCllerian ducts. \n\n-Both
    excess and deficient levels of estrogens can disrupt spermatogenesis and cause
    infertility.\n\n-Bell-clapper deformity is a deformity in which the testicle
    is not attached to the scrotal walls, and can rotate freely on the spermatic
    cord within the tunica vaginalis. \n\nIt is the most common underlying cause
    of testicular torsion.\n\n-Orchitis inflammation of the testicles\n-Epididymitis,
    a painful inflammation of the epididymis or epididymides frequently caused by
    bacterial infection but sometimes of unknown origin.\n-Anorchia, the absence
    of one or both testicles.\n-Cryptorchidism or \"undescended testicles\", when
    the testicle does not descend into the scrotum of the infant boy.\n-Testicular
    enlargement is an unspecific sign of various testicular diseases, and can be
    defined as a testicular size of more than 5 cm (long axis) \xD7 3 cm (short axis).\n-Blue
    balls is a slang term for a temporary fluid congestion in the testicles and prostate
    region caused by prolonged sexual arousal.\n-Testicular prostheses are available
    to mimic the appearance and feel of one or both testicles, when absent as from
    injury or as treatment in association to gender dysphoria. \n\nThere have also
    been some instances of their implantation in dogs.\n\n\n=== Effects of exogenous
    hormones ===\n\nTo some extent, it is possible to change testicular size. \n\nShort
    of direct injury or subjecting them to adverse conditions, e.g., higher temperature
    than they are normally accustomed to, they can be shrunk by competing against
    their intrinsic hormonal function through the use of externally administered
    steroidal hormones. \n\nSteroids taken for muscle enhancement (especially anabolic
    steroids) often have the undesired side effect of testicular shrinkage.\n\nSimilarly,
    stimulation of testicular functions via gonadotropic-like hormones may enlarge
    their size. \n\nTestes may shrink or atrophy during hormone replacement therapy
    or through chemical castration.\n\nIn all cases, the loss in testes volume corresponds
    with a loss of spermatogenesis.\n\n\n== Society and culture ==\n\n\nThe testicles
    of calves, lambs, roosters, turkeys, and other animals are eaten in many parts
    of the world, often under euphemistic culinary names. \n\nTesticles are a by-product
    of the castration of young animals raised for meat, so they were probably a late-spring
    seasonal specialty, though nowadays they are generally frozen and available year-round.\n\nAs
    early as 330 BC, Aristotle prescribed the ligation (tying off) of the left testicle
    in men wishing to have boys. \n\nIn the Middle Ages, men who wanted a boy sometimes
    had their left testicle removed. \n\nThis was because people believed that the
    right testicle made \"boy\" sperm and the left made \"girl\" sperm.\n\n\n== Etymology
    and slang ==\n\nOne theory about the etymology of the word testis is based on
    Roman law. \n\nThe original Latin word testis, \"witness\", was used in the firmly
    established legal principle \"Testis unus, testis nullus\" (one witness [equals]
    no witness), meaning that testimony by any one person in court was to be disregarded
    unless corroborated by the testimony of at least another. \n\nThis led to the
    common practice of producing two witnesses, bribed to testify the same way in
    cases of lawsuits with ulterior motives. \n\nSince such \"witnesses\" always
    came in pairs, the meaning was accordingly extended, often in the diminutive
    (testiculus, testiculi).\n\nAnother theory says that testis is influenced by
    a loan translation, from Greek parastat\u0113s \"defender (in law), supporter\"
    that is \"two glands side by side\".In slang, the testes are usually referred
    to as \"balls\" as a reference to blue balls. \n\nFrequently, \"nuts\" (sometimes
    intentionally misspelled as \"nutz\") are also a slang term for the testes due
    to the geometric resemblance, as evidenced by the various usages of the term
    \"Deez Nuts\", which include a satirical political candidate in 2016.\n\n\n==
    Other animals ==\n\n=== External appearance ===\n\nIn sharks, the testicle on
    the right side is usually larger, and in many bird and mammal species, the left
    may be the larger. \n\nThe primitive jawless fish have only a single testis,
    located in the midline of the body, although even this forms from the fusion
    of paired structures in the embryo.\n\nIn seasonal breeders, the weight of the
    testes often increases during the breeding season. \n\nThe testicles of a dromedary
    camel are 7\u201310 cm (2.8\u20133.9 in) long, 4.5 cm (1.8 in) deep and 5 cm
    (2.0 in) in width. \n\nThe right testicle is often smaller than the left.\n\n\n===
    Location ===\n\n==== Internal ====\n\nThe basal condition for mammals is to have
    internal testes. \n\nThe testes of monotremes, xenarthrans, and elephants remain
    within the abdomen. \n\nThere are also some marsupials with external testes and
    Boreoeutherian mammals with internal testes, such as the rhinoceros. \n\nCetaceans
    such as whales and dolphins also have internal testes. \n\nAs external testes
    would increase drag in the water they have internal testes which are kept cool
    by special circulatory systems that cool the arterial blood going to the testes
    by placing the arteries near veins bringing cooled venous blood from the skin.
    \n\nIn odobenids and phocids, the location of the testes is para-abdominal, though
    otariids have scrotal testes.\n\n\n==== External ====\n\nBoreoeutherian land
    mammals, the large group of mammals that includes humans, have externalized testes.
    \n\nTheir testes function best at temperatures lower than their core body temperature.
    \n\nTheir testes are located outside of the body, suspended by the spermatic
    cord within the scrotum.\n\nThere are several hypotheses why most boreotherian
    mammals have external testes which operate best at a temperature that is slightly
    less than the core body temperature, e.g. that it is stuck with enzymes evolved
    in a colder temperature due to external testes evolving for different reasons,
    that the lower temperature of the testes simply is more efficient for sperm production.\n\n   
    1) More efficient. \n\nThe classic hypothesis is that cooler temperature of the
    testes allows for more efficient fertile spermatogenesis. \n\nIn other words,
    there are no possible enzymes operating at normal core body temperature that
    are as efficient as the ones evolved, at least none appearing in our evolution
    so far.\n\nThe early mammals had lower body temperatures and thus their testes
    worked efficiently within their body. \n\nHowever it is argued that boreotherian
    mammals have higher body temperatures than the other mammals and had to develop
    external testes to keep them cool. \n\nIt is argued that those mammals with internal
    testes, such as the monotremes, armadillos, sloths, elephants, and rhinoceroses,
    have a lower core body temperatures than those mammals with external testes.\n\nHowever,
    the question remains why birds despite having very high core body temperatures
    have internal testes and did not evolve external testes. \n\nIt was once theorized
    that birds used their air sacs to cool the testes internally, but later studies
    revealed that birds' testes are able to function at core body temperature.\n\nSome
    mammals which have seasonal breeding cycles keep their testes internal until
    the breeding season at which point their testes descend and increase in size
    and become external.\n\n    2) Irreversible adaptation to sperm competition.
    \n\nIt has been suggested that the ancestor of the boreoeutherian mammals was
    a small mammal that required very large testes (perhaps rather like those of
    a hamster) for sperm competition and thus had to place its testes outside the
    body. \n\nThis led to enzymes involved in spermatogenesis, spermatogenic DNA
    polymerase beta and recombinase activities evolving a unique temperature optimum,
    slightly less than core body temperature. \n\nWhen the boreoeutherian mammals
    then diversified into forms that were larger and/or did not require intense sperm
    competition they still produced enzymes that operated best at cooler temperatures
    and had to keep their testes outside the body. \n\nThis position is made less
    parsimonious by the fact that the kangaroo, a non-boreoeutherian mammal, has
    external testicles. \n\nThe ancestors of kangaroos might, separately from boreotherian
    mammals, have also been subject to heavy sperm competition and thus developed
    external testes, however, kangaroo external testes are suggestive of a possible
    adaptive function for external testes in large animals.\n\n    3) Protection
    from abdominal cavity pressure changes. \n\nOne argument for the evolution of
    external testes is that it protects the testes from abdominal cavity pressure
    changes caused by jumping and galloping.\n\n    4) Protection against DNA damage.
    \n\nMild, transient scrotal heat stress causes DNA damage, reduced fertility
    and abnormal embryonic development in mice. \n\nDNA strand breaks were found
    in spermatocytes recovered from testicles subjected to 40 \xB0C or 42 \xB0C for
    30 minutes. \n\nThese findings suggest that the external location of the testicles
    provides the adaptive benefit of protecting spermatogenic cells from heat-induced
    DNA damage that could otherwise lead to infertility and germline mutation.\n\n\n===
    Size ===\n\nThe relative size of testes is often influenced by mating systems.
    \n\nTesticular size as a proportion of body weight varies widely. \n\nIn the
    mammalian kingdom, there is a tendency for testicular size to correspond with
    multiple mates (e.g., harems, polygamy). \n\nProduction of testicular output
    sperm and spermatic fluid is also larger in polygamous animals, possibly a spermatogenic
    competition for survival. \n\nThe testes of the right whale are likely to be
    the largest of any animal, each weighing around 500 kg (1,100 lb).\n\nAmong the
    Hominidae, gorillas have little female promiscuity and sperm competition and
    the testes are small compared to body weight (0.03%). \n\nChimpanzees have high
    promiscuity and large testes compared to body weight (0.3%). \n\nHuman testicular
    size falls between these extremes (0.08%).Testis weight also varies in seasonal
    breeders like red foxes, golden jackals and coyotes.\n\n\n=== Internal structure
    ===\n\nUnder a tough membranous shell called the tunica albuginea, the testis
    of amniotes, as well as some teleost fish, contains very fine coiled tubes called
    seminiferous tubules.\n\nAmphibians and most fish do not possess seminiferous
    tubules. \n\nInstead, the sperm are produced in spherical structures called sperm
    ampullae. \n\nThese are seasonal structures, releasing their contents during
    the breeding season, and then being reabsorbed by the body. \n\nBefore the next
    breeding season, new sperm ampullae begin to form and ripen. \n\nThe ampullae
    are otherwise essentially identical to the seminiferous tubules in higher vertebrates,
    including the same range of cell types.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testicle"

  descriptionText: "\n\nRENAL PELVIS\n\n\nThe renal pelvis or pelvis of the kidney
    is the funnel-like dilated part of the ureter in the kidney. \n\nIn humans, the
    renal pelvis is the point where the two or three major calyces join. \n\nIt has
    a mucous membrane and is covered with transitional epithelium and an underlying
    lamina propria of loose-to-dense connective tissue.\nThe renal pelvis functions
    as a funnel for urine flowing to the ureter.\nThe renal pelvis is the location
    of several kinds of kidney cancer and is affected by infection in pyelonephritis.\n\n\n==
    Clinical significance ==\n\nThe renal pelvis is the location of several kinds
    of kidney cancer and is affected by infection in pyelonephritis. \n\nA large
    \"staghorn\" kidney stone may block all or part of the renal pelvis.\nThe size
    of the renal pelvis plays a major role in the grading of hydronephrosis. \n\nNormally,
    the anteroposterior diameter of the renal pelvis is less than 4 mm in fetuses
    up to 32 weeks of gestational age and 7 mm afterwards. \n\nIn adults, 13% of
    the normal population have a transverse pelvic diameter of over 10 mm.\n\n\n==
    Etymology and pronunciation ==\n\nLike the bony pelvis, the renal pelvis () gets
    its English name via New Latin from the older Latin word pelvis, \"basin\", as
    in \"wash basin\". \n\nIn both cases the name reflects the shape of the structure,
    and in the case of the renal pelvis, it also reflects the function. \n\nThe name
    reflects that each renal pelvis collects urine from the calyces and funnels it
    into the ureter like a wash basin collects water and funnels it into a drain
    pipe. \n\nThe renal pelvis is occasionally called the pyelum (from Greek \u03C0\u03CD\u03B5\u03BB\u03BF\u03C2
    p\xFDelos, \"trough\", \u2018anything hollow\u2019), and the combining form pyelo-
    denotes the renal pelvis (pyelo- is not to be confused with pyo-). \n\nThe words
    infundibulum and choana are other words for funnel-shaped cavities (which medical
    English got from the Latin and Greek words for \"funnel\", respectively), and
    the renal pelvis is sometimes called the renal infundibulum. \n\nThe form *renal
    choana is logical but is not used.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_pelvis"

  descriptionText: "\n\nPAROTID GLAND\n\n\nThe parotid gland is a major salivary
    gland in many animals. \n\nIn humans, the two parotid glands are present on either
    side of the mouth and in front of both ears. \n\nThey are the largest of the
    salivary glands. \n\nEach parotid is wrapped around the mandibular ramus, and
    secretes serous saliva through the parotid duct into the mouth, to facilitate
    mastication and swallowing and to begin the digestion of starches. \n\nThere
    are also two other types of salivary glands; they are submandibular and sublingual
    glands. \n\nSometimes accessory parotid glands are found close to the main parotid
    glands.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe word parotid literally means \"beside the
    ear\". \n\nFrom Greek \u03C0\u03B1\u03C1\u03C9\u03C4\u03AF\u03C2 (stem \u03C0\u03B1\u03C1\u03C9\u03C4\u03B9\u03B4-)
    : (gland) behind the ear < \u03C0\u03B1\u03C1\u03AC - par\xE1 : in front, and
    \u03BF\u1F56\u03C2 - ous (stem \u1F60\u03C4-, \u014Dt-) : ear.\n\n\n== Structure
    ==\n\nThe parotid glands are a pair of mainly serous salivary glands located
    below and in front of each ear canal, draining their secretions into the vestibule
    of the mouth through the parotid duct. \n\nEach gland lies behind the mandibular
    ramus and in front of the mastoid process of the temporal bone. \n\nThe gland
    can be felt on either side, by feeling in front of each ear, along the cheek,
    and below the angle of the mandible.\n\nThe parotid duct, a long excretory duct,
    emerges from the front of each gland, superficial to the masseter muscle. \n\nThe
    duct pierces the buccinator muscle, then opens into the mouth on the inner surface
    of the cheek, usually opposite the maxillary second molar. \n\nThe parotid papilla
    is a small elevation of tissue that marks the opening of the parotid duct on
    the inner surface of the cheek.The gland has four surfaces \u2013 superficial
    or lateral, superior, anteromedial, and posteromedial. \n\nThe gland has three
    borders \u2013 anterior, medial, and posterior. \n\nThe parotid gland has two
    ends \u2013 superior end in the form of small superior surface and an inferior
    end (apex). \n\nA number of different structures pass through the gland. \n\nFrom
    lateral to medial, these are:\n\nFacial nerve\nRetromandibular vein\nExternal
    carotid artery\nSuperficial temporal artery\nBranches of the great auricular
    nerve\nMaxillary arterySometimes accessory parotid glands are found as an anatomic
    variation. \n\nThese are close to the main glands and consist of ectopic salivary
    gland tissue.\n\nCapsule of parotid gland\n\nCapsule of the parotid gland is
    formed from the investing layer of the deep cervical fascia. \n\nIt is supplied
    by great auricular nerve. \n\nThe fascia splits to enclose the gland. \n\nThis
    splitting occurs between the angle of the mandible and the mastoid process. \n\nThe
    superficial lamina (parotidomassetric fascia) is thick and is attached to zygomatic
    arch. \n\nThe deep lamina is thin and is attached to styloid process, tympanic
    plate and the ramus of the mandible. \n\nThe part of deep lamina extending between
    the styloid process and the mandible is thickened to form stylomastoid ligament.
    \n\nThe stylomandibular ligament separates parotid gland from the superficial
    lobe of the submandibular gland.\n\n\n=== Location ===\n\nSuperficial or lateral
    relations: \n    The gland is situated deep to the skin, superficial fascia,
    superficial lamina of investing layer of deep cervical fascia and great auricular
    nerve (anterior ramus of C2 and C3).\n\nAnteromedial relations: \n    The gland
    is situated posterolaterally to the mandibular ramus, masseter and medial pterygoid
    muscles. \n\nA part of the gland may extend between the ramus and medial pterygoid,
    as the pterygoid process. \n\nBranches of facial nerve and parotid duct emerge
    through this surface.\n\nPosteromedial relations: \n    The gland is situated
    anterolaterally to mastoid process of temporal bone with its attached sternocleidomastoid
    and digastric muscles, styloid process of temporal bone with its three attached
    muscles (stylohyoid, stylopharyngeus, and styloglossus) and carotid sheath with
    its contained neurovasculature (internal carotid artery, internal jugular vein,
    and 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th cranial nerves).\n\nMedial relations: \n    The
    parotid gland comes into contact with the superior pharyngeal constrictor muscle
    at the medial border, where the anteromedial and posteromedial surfaces meet.
    \n\nHence, a need exists to examine the fauces in parotitis.\n\n\n=== Blood supply
    ===\n\nThe external carotid artery and its terminal branches within the gland,
    namely, the superficial temporal and the maxillary artery, also the posterior
    auricular artery supply the parotid gland. \n\nVenous return is to the retromandibular
    veins.\n\n\n=== Lymphatic drainage ===\n\nThe gland is mainly drained into the
    preauricular or parotid lymph nodes which ultimately drain to the deep cervical
    chain.\n\n\n=== Nerve supply ===\n\nThe parotid gland receives both sensory and
    autonomic innervation. \n\nGeneral sensory innervation to the parotid gland,
    its sheath, and the overlying skin is provided by the auriculotemporal nerve.
    \n\nThe autonomic innervation controls the rate of saliva production and is supplied
    by the glossopharyngeal nerve.\n\nThe cell bodies of the preganglionic sympathetic
    fibres usually lie in the lateral horns of upper thoracic spinal segments (T1-T3).
    \n\nPostganglionic sympathetic fibers from superior cervical sympathetic ganglion
    reach the gland as periarterial nerve plexuses around the external carotid artery
    and their function is mainly vasoconstriction. \n\nPreganglionic parasympathetic
    fibers leave the brain stem from inferior salivatory nucleus in the glossopharyngeal
    nerve and then through its tympanic and then the lesser petrosal branch pass
    into the otic ganglion. \n\nThere, they synapse with postganglionic fibers which
    reach the gland by hitch-hiking via the auriculotemporal nerve, a branch of the
    mandibular nerve.:\u200A255\u200A\n\n\n=== Histology ===\n\n\nThe gland has a
    capsule of its own of dense connective tissue, but is also provided with a false
    capsule by the investing layer of the deep cervical fascia. \n\nThe fascia at
    the imaginary line between the angle of the mandible and the mastoid process
    splits into a superficial and a deep lamina to enclose the gland. \n\nThe risorius
    is a small muscle embedded with this capsule substance.\nThe gland has short,
    striated ducts and long, intercalated ducts. \n\nThe intercalated ducts are also
    numerous and lined with cuboidal epithelial cells, and have lumina larger than
    those of the acini. \n\nThe striated ducts are also numerous and consist of simple
    columnar epithelium, having striations that represent the infolded basal cell
    membranes and mitochondria.\n\nThough the parotid gland is the largest, it provides
    only 25% of the total salivary volume. \n\nThe serous cell predominates in the
    parotid, making the gland secrete a mainly serous secretory product.\n\nThe parotid
    gland also secretes salivary alpha-amylase (sAA), which is the first step in
    the decomposition of starches during mastication. \n\nIt is the main exocrine
    gland to secrete this. \n\nIt breaks down amylose (straight chain starch) and
    amylopectin (branched starch) by hydrolyzing alpha 1,4 bonds. \n\nAdditionally,
    the alpha amylase has been suggested to prevent bacterial attachment to oral
    surfaces and to enable bacterial clearance from the mouth.\n\n\n== Development
    ==\n\nThe parotid salivary glands appear early in the sixth week of the prenatal
    development and are the first major salivary glands formed. \n\nThe epithelial
    buds of these glands are located on the inner part of the cheek, near the labial
    commissures of the primitive mouth (from ectodermal lining near angles of the
    stomodeum in the 1st/2nd pharyngeal arches; the stomodeum itself is created from
    the rupturing of the oropharyngeal membrane at about 26 days.) \n\nThese buds
    grow posteriorly toward the otic placodes of the ears and branch to form solid
    cords with rounded terminal ends near the developing facial nerve. \n\nLater,
    at around 10 weeks of prenatal development, these cords are canalized and form
    ducts, with the largest becoming the parotid duct for the parotid gland. \n\nThe
    rounded terminal ends of the cords form the acini of the glands. \n\nSecretion
    by the parotid glands via the parotid duct begins at about 18 weeks of gestation.
    \n\nAgain, the supporting connective tissue of the gland develops from the surrounding
    mesenchyme.\n\n\n== Parotid gland swellings ==\n\n=== Causes ===\n\n==== Mumps
    ====\n\nMumps is seen to be a common cause of parotid gland swelling \u2013 85%
    of cases occur in children younger than 15 years. \n\nThe disease is highly contagious
    and spreads by airborne droplets from salivary, nasal, and urinary secretions.
    \n\nSymptoms include oedema in the area, trismus as well as otalgia. \n\nThe
    lesion tends to begin on one side of the face and eventually becomes bilateral.
    \n\nThe transmission of the paramyxovirus is by contact with the infected persons
    saliva. \n\nInitial symptoms tend to be a headache and fever. \n\nMumps is not
    fatal, however further complications can include swelling of the ovaries or the
    testes. \n\nDiagnosis of mumps is confirmed through viral serology, management
    of the condition includes hydration and good oral hygiene of the patient requiring
    excellent motivation. \n\nHowever, since the development of the mumps vaccine,
    given at the age of between 4\u20136 years, the incidence of this viral infection
    has greatly reduced. \n\nThis vaccine has reduced the incidence by 99%.\n\n\n====
    Neoplasms ====\n\n===== Benign =====\n\nNeoplastic lesions of the parotid salivary
    gland can either be benign or malignant. \n\nWithin the parotid gland, nearly
    80% of tumours are benign. \n\nBenign lesions tend to be painless, asymptomatic
    and slow-growing. \n\nThe most common salivary gland neoplasms in children are
    hemangiomas, lymphatic malformations, and pleomorphic adenomas. \n\nDiagnosis
    of benign lesions require a fine-needle-like aspiration biopsy. \n\nWith various
    benign lesions, most commonly the pleomorphic adenoma, there is a risk of developing
    malignancy over time. \n\nAs a result, these lesions are typically resected.\n\nPleomorphic
    adenoma is seen to be a common benign neoplasm of the salivary gland and has
    an overall incidence of 54\u201368%. \n\nThe Warthin tumour has a lower incidence
    of 6\u201310%; this tumour is associated with smoking and is more common in older
    men. \n\nBenign lesions of the parotid gland have a significantly higher incidence
    than malignant lesions.\n\n\n===== Malignant =====\n\nMalignant salivary gland
    lesions are rare. \n\nHowever, when a tumour extends to the submandibular, sublingual
    and the minor salivary glands, they tend to be malignant. \n\nDistinguishing
    a malignant lesion from a benign one may be difficult as they both present as
    painless lesions. \n\nA biopsy is crucial in aiding diagnosis. \n\nThere are
    common signs that can highlight the presence of a malignant lesion. \n\nThese
    include facial nerve weakness, rapid increase of the size of the lump as well
    as ulceration of the mucosa of the skin.\n\nMucoepidermoid carcinoma is a common
    malignant tumour of the salivary glands and has a low incidence of 4\u201313%.
    \n\nAdenoid cystic carcinoma is also a common malignant salivary gland lesion
    and has an incidence of 4\u20138%. \n\nThis carcinoma tends to invade nerves
    and can re-occur post-treatment.\n\n\n==== Polycystic Parotid Disease ====\n\nA
    developmental polycystic disease of the salivary gland is seen to be extremely
    rare and is seen to be independent of recurrent parotitis. \n\nThe cause is thought
    to be a defect in the interactions between activin, follistatin and TGF-\u03B2,
    leading to a developmental disorder of glandular tissue.\n\n\n== Clinical significance
    ==\n\n=== Parotitis ===\n\nInflammation of one or both parotid glands is known
    as parotitis. \n\nThe most common cause of parotitis is mumps. \n\nWidespread
    vaccination against mumps has markedly reduced the incidence of mumps parotitis.
    \n\nThe pain of mumps is due to the swelling of the gland within its fibrous
    capsule.\n\nApart from viral infection, other infections, such as bacterial,
    can cause parotitis (acute suppurative parotitis or chronic parotitis). \n\nThese
    infections may cause blockage of the duct by salivary duct calculi or external
    compression. \n\nParotid gland swellings can also be due to benign lymphoepithelial
    lesions caused by Mikulicz disease and Sj\xF6gren syndrome. \n\nSwelling of the
    parotid gland may also indicate the eating disorder bulimia nervosa, creating
    the look of a heavy jaw line. \n\nWith the inflammation of mumps or obstruction
    of the ducts, increased levels of the salivary alpha amylase secreted by the
    parotid gland can be detected in the blood stream.\n\n\n=== Fibrous reactions
    ===\n\nTuberculosis and syphilis can cause granuloma formation in the parotid
    glands.\n\n\n=== Salivary stones ===\n\nSalivary stones mainly occur within the
    main confluence of the ducts and within the main parotid duct. \n\nThe patient
    usually complains of intense pain when salivating and tends to avoid foods which
    produce this symptom. \n\nIn addition, the parotid gland may become enlarged
    upon trying to eat. \n\nThe pain can be reproduced in clinic by squirting lemon
    juice into the mouth. \n\nSurgery depends upon the site of the stone: if within
    the anterior aspect of the duct, a simple incision into the buccal mucosa with
    sphinterotomy may allow removal; however, if situated more posteriorly within
    the main duct, complete gland excision may be necessary.\n\n\n=== Injury ===\n\nThe
    parotid salivary gland can also be pierced and the facial nerve temporarily traumatized
    when an inferior alveolar local anesthesia nerve block is incorrectly administered,
    causing transient facial paralysis.\n\n\n=== Cancer and tumours ===\n\nAbout
    80% of tumors of the parotid gland are benign. \n\nThe most common of these include
    pleomorphic adenoma (70% of tumors, of which 60% occur in females) and Warthin
    tumor (i.e. adenolymphoma, which is more common in males than in females). \n\nTheir
    importance is in relation to their anatomical position and tendency to grow over
    time. \n\nThe tumorous growth can also change the consistency of the gland and
    cause facial pain on the involved side.\n\nAround 20% of parotid tumors are malignant,
    with the most common tumors being mucoepidermoid carcinoma and adenoid cystic
    carcinoma. \n\nOther malignant tumors of the parotid gland include acinic cell
    carcinoma, carcinoma expleomorphic adenoma, adenocarcinoma (arising from ductal
    epithelium of parotid gland), squamous cell carcinoma (arising from parenchyma
    of parotid gland), and undifferentiated carcinoma. \n\nMetastasis from other
    sites like phyllodes tumour of breast presenting as parotid swelling have also
    been described. \n\nCritically, the relationship of the tumor to the branches
    of the facial nerve (CN VII) must be defined because resection may damage the
    nerves, resulting in paralysis of the muscles of facial expression.\n\n\n===
    Surgery ===\n\nSurgical treatment of parotid gland tumors is sometimes difficult
    because of the anatomical relations of the facial nerve parotid lodge, as well
    as the increased potential for postoperative relapse. \n\nThus, detection of
    early stages of a parotid tumor is extremely important in terms of postoperative
    prognosis. \n\nOperative technique is laborious, because of relapses and incomplete
    previous treatment made in other border specialties. \n\nSurgical techniques
    in parotid surgery have evolved in the last years with the use of neuromonitoring
    of the facial nerve and have become safer and less invasive.\n\nAfter surgical
    removal of the parotid gland (Parotidectomy), the auriculotemporal nerve is liable
    to damage and upon recovery it fuses with sweat glands. \n\nThis can cause sweating
    on the cheek on the side of the face of the affected gland. \n\nThis condition
    is known as Frey's syndrome.\n\n\n== Infections ==\n\n=== Bacterial infections
    ===\n\n==== Acute bacterial parotitis ====\n\nCommonly caused by a retrograde
    bacterial infection as a result of illness, sepsis, trauma, surgery, reduced
    salivary flow due to medications, diabetes, malnutrition and dehydration. \n\nClassically
    symptoms of painful swelling in the parotid region when eating seen. \n\nManagement
    is based upon antibacterials, rehydration combined with gentle massage to encourage
    salivary flow.\n\n\n==== Chronic bacterial parotitis ====\n\nA latent infection
    despite clinical resolution of the disease resulting in impaired function. \n\nHistologically
    glandular duct dilation, abscess formation and atrophy may be seen. \n\nParotid
    secretions are viscous. \n\nDisease course shows pain and swelling, waxing and
    waning. \n\nRadiographic screening should be undertaken to rule out sialolith.
    \n\nManagement with palliative care with parotidectomy as a last resort.\n\n\n\n===
    Viral infections ===\n\n==== Mumps ====\n\nAcute non-suppurative disease that
    often occurs in epidemics. \n\nPrevented by MMR vaccine. \n\nCaused by paramyxovirus
    that is transmitted by infected saliva and urine. \n\nA prodromal period of 24\u201328
    hours is experienced, followed by rapid and painful swelling of the parotid gland.
    \n\nTreatment is supportive (bedrest, hydration) as spontaneous resolution occurs
    within 5\u201310 days.\n\n\n==== HIV / AIDS ====\n\nDiffuse gland enlargement
    is seen, and may affect patients throughout all stages of the infection. \n\nLymphoepithelial
    cysts seen via imaging help aid diagnosis. \n\nPathogenic process occurs due
    to circulating CD8 lymphocytes within the salivary gland. \n\nMedical management
    via use of antiretrovirals, excellent oral hygiene measures and sialogogues.\n\n\n===
    Autoimmune related ===\n\n==== Systemic lupus erythematosus ====\n\nMost commonly
    seen in fourth and fifth decades in women, and can affect any salivary gland.
    \n\nPresentation is a slowly enlarging gland, with diagnosis made by identification
    of the underlying systemic disorder and measurements of salivary chemical levels.
    \n\nSodium and chloride ion levels will be elevated two or three times normal
    levels. \n\nTreatment is by addressing the underlying systemic condition.\n\n\n====
    Sarcoidosis ====\n\nSarcoidosis is a chronic systemic disease characterised by
    the production of non-caseating granulomas of unknown aetiology. \n\nIt can affect
    any organ of the body, depressing cellular immunity and enhancing humoral immunity.\n\nSalivary
    gland involvement primarily involves the parotid gland, causing enlargement and
    swelling. \n\nSalivary gland biopsy with histopathologic examination is needed
    to make the distinction between whether Sjoren\u2019s syndrome or sarcoidosis
    is the cause of this.\n\n\n==== Sjogren's syndrome ====\n\nSalivary gland enlargement
    occurs in up to 30% of patients with Sjogren\u2019s syndrome, with the parotid
    gland being most often enlarged, and bilateral parotid gland enlargement seen
    in 25\u201360% of patients. \n\nHowever, the parotid glands have a longer-lasting
    secretory capacity in Sjogren\u2019s syndrome patient and therefore are the last
    glands to manifest hyposalivation in the disease. \n\nHistopathology shows clustering
    of lymphocytic infiltrates and epimyoepithelial islands.\n\n\n=== Mycobacterial
    infection ===\n\n\nThe most common head and neck manifestation of tuberculosis
    mycobacterial disease is infection of cervical lymph nodes. \n\nThe infection
    is thought to originate in the tonsils or gingiva, ascending to the parotid gland.
    \n\nTwo clinical forms; acute and chronic lesions. \n\nAcute lesions have diffuse
    glandular edema, easily confused with acute sialdentitis or abscess. \n\nThe
    chronic lesions occur as slow growing masses mimicking tumors.\n\n\n== Examination
    of the salivary gland ==\n\n\n\n=== History and examination ===\n\nA patient
    with parotid swelling may complain of swelling, pain, xerostomia, bad taste and
    sometimes sialorrhoea.\n\nThe most common presenting symptom of neoplasms (both
    benign and malignant) is an asymptomatic swelling. \n\nPain is more common in
    patients with parotid cancer (10\u201329% feel pain) than those with benign neoplasms
    (only 2.5\u20134%), but pain itself it not diagnostic of malignancy.\n\nEpisodic
    swelling of major salivary glands accompanied by pain and related to salivary
    stimuli suggests duct obstruction.\n\nAlso need to assess the facial nerve. \n\nThe
    facial nerve passes through the parotid so may be affected if there is a change
    in the parotid gland. \n\nFacial nerve paralysis in a previously untreated patient
    usually indicates that a tumour is malignant.\n\n\n=== Physical examination ===\n\nThe
    superficial location of the salivary glands allows palpation and visual inspection.
    \n\nThe inspection must be systematic, both intraorally and extraorally, so no
    area is missed.\n\nFor extraoral examination the patients head should be inclined
    forwards in order to maximally expose the parotid and submandibular glands. \n\nA
    normal parotid gland is barely palpable and a normal sublingual gland is not
    palpable.Intra-oral examination should include observations for asymmetry, discolouration,
    pulsation and obstructions in the duct orifices. \n\nSwelling of the deep lobe
    of the parotid gland may be seen intra-orally, and may also displace the tonsil.
    \n\nThe minor salivary glands should be examined. \n\nThe labial, buccal and
    posterior palatal mucosa should be dried with an air blower or tissue and pressed
    to assess the flow of saliva.\n\n\n=== Salivary testing ===\n\nSalivary stimulation\n\nThis
    can be done by palpating the parotid gland, thus stimulating it. \n\nAssess to
    see whether there is saliva flowing from the parotid papilla.Sialography\n\nSialograms
    can identify changes in salivary gland architecture and are useful in the evaluation
    of major gland swellings.\n\nIt involves the instillation of a radio-opaque fluid
    into the major gland ductal system. \n\nThis outlines the major and minor ductal
    systems, and also gives an outline of the glandular tissue.\n\nFor example, sialadenitis
    creates an appearance known as \u201Cpruning of the tree\u201D on a sialogram,
    where there are less branches visible from the duct system. \n\nAlso, a space
    occupying lesion that occurs within or adjacent to a salivary gland can displace
    the normal anatomy of the gland. \n\nThis may create an appearance known as \u201Cball
    in hand\u201D on a sialogram, where the ducts are curved around the mass of the
    lesion.Sialochemistry\n\nThe composition of saliva changes in disease states,
    and analysis of saliva for enzymes, electrolytes, hormones, drugs and immunisation
    status can be performed.Radioisotope scintigraphy \n\nGives an objective measure
    of isotope uptake and excretion using a gamma scintillation camera. \n\nAfter
    about 20 minutes, a salivary stimulant will be given to promote salivary flow
    through the gland. \n\nThey are used to assess patients with persistent symptoms
    of dry mouth and also to evaluate salivary gland swelling due to infection, inflammation
    or obstruction.\n\n\n=== Further tests ===\n\n-Imagining techniques\n\n-Ultrasounds,
    CT Scans or MRIs can aid with disease localisation\n\n-Sialoendoscopy\n\n-A camera
    is inserted into the duct of a salivary gland to assess blockages\n\n-Biopsy\n\n-This
    can be done by fine needle aspiration biopsy, which provides an opportunity to
    obtain information about the histology of a salivary tumour prior to initiation
    of treatment.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parotid_gland"

  descriptionText: "\n\nGLANS PENIS\n\n\nThe glans penis, commonly referred to as
    the glans, is a structure at the distal end of the penis in male mammals. \n\nIt
    is the sensitive bulbous structure at the end of the human penis, and is anatomically
    homologous to the clitoral glans of the human female. \n\nThe glans penis may
    be smooth, spiny, elongated, or divided in other mammals.\n\nTypically, the glans
    is completely or partially covered by the foreskin in humans, except in those
    who have been circumcised. \n\nThe foreskin can generally be retracted over and
    past the glans, and may automatically retract during an erection. \n\nThe glans
    is more commonly known as the \"head\" or the \"tip\" of the penis. \n\nThe medical
    name comes from the Latin words glans (\"acorn\") and penis (\"of the penis\").\n\n\n==
    In humans ==\n\n\n=== Structure ===\n\nThe glans penis is the expanded cap of
    the corpus spongiosum. \n\nIt is moulded on the rounded ends of the corpora cavernosa
    penis, extending farther on their upper than on their lower surfaces. \n\nAt
    the summit of the glans is the slit-like vertical external urethral orifice.
    \n\nThe circumference of the base of the glans forms a rounded projecting border,
    the corona glandis, overhanging a deep retroglandular groove known as the coronal
    sulcus, behind which is the neck of the penis. \n\nThe proportional size of the
    glans penis can vary greatly. \n\nOn some penises it is much wider in circumference
    than the shaft, giving the penis a mushroom-like appearance, and on others it
    is narrower and more akin to a probe in shape. \n\nThe soft cushiony texture
    of the glans absorbs impact during rigorous instances of copulation.The foreskin
    maintains the mucosa in a moist environment. \n\nCircumcised penises have a glans
    which is permanently exposed and dry. \n\nSeveral studies have suggested the
    glans is equally sensitive in both circumcised and uncircumcised penises, while
    others have reported it is more sensitive in people who are not circumcised.\n\nHalata
    & Munger (1986) report that the density of genital corpuscles is greatest in
    the corona glandis, while Yang & Bradley's (1998) report \"showed no areas in
    the glans to be more densely innervated than others.\n\n\"Halata & Spathe (1997)
    reported; \"the glans penis contains a predominance of free nerve endings, numerous
    genital end bulbs and rarely Pacinian and Ruffinian corpuscles. \n\nMerkel nerve
    endings and Meissner's corpuscles are not present.\"Yang & Bradley argue; \"the
    distinct pattern of innervation of the glans emphasizes the role of the glans
    as a sensory structure\". \n\nSome researchers have suggested that the glans
    has evolved to become acorn, mushroom or cone shaped so that during copulation
    it acts to remove any semen still there from previous sex partners, but this
    is not supported when looking at primate relatives who have different mating
    behaviors.\n\n\n=== Clinical significance ===\n\nThe meatus (opening) of the
    urethra is located at the tip of the glans penis.\nThe epithelium of the glans
    penis is mucocutaneous tissue. \n\nBirley et al. report that excessive washing
    with soap may dry the mucous membrane which covers the glans penis and cause
    non-specific dermatitis.\n\nInflammation of the glans penis is known as balanitis,
    and, occurs in 3\u201311% of males (up to 35% of diabetic males). \n\nEdwards
    reported that it is generally more common in males who have poor hygiene habits
    or have not been circumcised. \n\nIt has many causes, including irritation, or
    infection with a wide variety of pathogens. \n\nCareful identification of the
    cause with the aid of patient history, physical examination, swabs and cultures,
    and biopsy are essential in order to determine the proper treatment.\n\nMeatal
    stenosis is a late complication of circumcision, which occurs in about 2 to 20
    percent of circumcised boys.\n\n\n== Other animals ==\n\nMale felids are able
    to urinate backwards by curving the tip of the glans penis backward. \n\nIn cats,
    the glans penis is covered with spines, but in dogs, the glans is smooth. \n\nPenile
    spines also occur on the glans of male and female spotted hyenas.In male dogs,
    the glans penis consists of two parts called the bulbus glandis and pars longa
    glandis. \n\nThe glans of a fossa's penis extends about halfway down the shaft
    and is spiny except at the tip. \n\nIn comparison, the glans of felids is short
    and spiny, while that of viverrids is smooth and long.\nThe shape of the glans
    varies among different marsupial species. \n\nIn most marsupials, the glans is
    divided, but male macropods have an undivided glans penis. \n\nThe glans penis
    is also divided into two parts in platypuses and echidnas.\n\nThe glans penis
    of the marsh rice rat is long and robust, averaging 7.3 mm (0.29 in) long and
    4.6 mm (0.18 in) broad.\n\nIn Thomasomys ucucha the glans penis is rounded, short,
    and small and is superficially divided into left and right halves by a trough
    at the top and a ridge at the bottom. \n\nMost of the glans is covered with spines,
    except for an area near the tip.\n\nWinkelmann's mouse can most readily be distinguished
    from its close relatives by its partially corrugated glans penis.\n\nWhen erect,
    the glans of a horse's penis increases by 3 to 4 times. \n\nThe urethra opens
    within the urethral fossa, a small pouch at the distal end of the glans. \n\nUnlike
    the human glans, the glans of a horse's penis extends backwards on its shaft.\n\nMales
    of Racey's pipistrelle bat have a narrow, egg-shaped glans penis.\n\nThe glans
    penis of a male cape ground squirrel is large with a prominent baculum.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glans_penis"

  descriptionText: "\n\nTAENIA COLI\n\n\nThe taeniae coli (also teniae coli or tenia
    coli) are three separate longitudinal ribbons (taeniae meaning ribbon in Latin)
    of smooth muscle on the outside of the ascending, transverse, descending and
    sigmoid colons. \n\nThey are visible and can be seen just below the serosa or
    fibrosa. \n\nThere are three teniae coli: mesocolic, free and omental taeniae
    coli. \n\nThe teniae coli contract lengthwise to produce the haustra, the bulges
    in the colon.\nThe bands converge at the root of the vermiform appendix. \n\nAt
    the rectosigmoid junction, the taeniae spread out and unite to form the longitudinal
    muscle layer. \n\nIn the caecum, the ascending colon, the descending colon and
    sigmoid colon the positions of these bands are fixed. \n\nThe taenia libera,
    is placed anteriorly in the caecum, ascending, descending and sigmoid colon,
    but is placed inferiorly in the transverse colon. \n\nThe taenia mesocolica is
    present on the posteromedial surface of caecum, ascending, descending and sigmoid
    colon, but is placed posteriorly on transverse colon at the site of attachment
    of transverse mesocolon. \n\nThe taenia omentalis is situated posterolaterally
    in caecum, ascending, descending and sigmoid colon, but is situated on the anterosuperior
    surface of transverse colon where layers three and four of the greater omentum
    meet the transverse colon. \n\nThis change in position is due to the twist in
    transverse colon. \n\nThese bands correspond to the outer layer of the muscularis
    externa, in other portions of the digestive tract.\n\nThe teniae coli are regulated
    by the sacral nerves of the spinal cord, which are under control of the parasympathetic
    nervous system.\n\n\n== Diverticulosis ==\n\n\nSpaces between the circular bands
    of taeniae are weak points in the bowel, and are the sites of diverticulosis.
    \n\nMost diverticulosis occur in the sigmoid colon as it is the segment with
    the highest intraluminal pressure. \n\nDiverticulosis does not occur in the rectum
    as the tenia coli become a continuous muscular layer. \n\nDiverticulosis can
    then become diverticulitis if the patient develops inflammation of the diverticulosis,
    this whole spectrum of disease is called diverticular disease.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taenia_coli"

    also known as the large bowel, is the last part of the gastrointestinal tract
    and of the digestive system in vertebrates. \n\nWater is absorbed here and the
    remaining waste material is stored as feces before being removed by defecation.The
    colon is the largest portion of the large intestine, so many mentions of the
    large intestine and colon overlap in meaning whenever precision is not the focus.
    \n\nMost sources define the large intestine as the combination of the cecum,
    colon, rectum, and anal canal. \n\nSome other sources exclude the anal canal.In
    humans, the large intestine begins in the right iliac region of the pelvis, just
    at or below the waist, where it is joined to the end of the small intestine at
    the cecum, via the ileocecal valve. \n\nIt then continues as the colon ascending
    the abdomen, across the width of the abdominal cavity as the transverse colon,
    and then descending to the rectum and its endpoint at the anal canal. \n\nOverall,
    in humans, the large intestine is about 1.5 metres (5 ft) long, which is about
    one-fifth of the whole length of the gastrointestinal tract.\n\n\n== Structure
    ==\n\nThe colon is the last part of the digestive system. \n\nIt has a segmented
    appearance due to a series of saccules called haustra. \n\nIt extracts water
    and salt from solid wastes before they are eliminated from the body and is the
    site in which flora-aided (largely bacterial) fermentation of unabsorbed material
    occurs. \n\nUnlike the small intestine, the colon does not play a major role
    in absorption of foods and nutrients. \n\nAbout 1.5 litres or 45 ounces of water
    arrives in the colon each day.The length of the average adult human colon is
    65 inches or 166 cm (range of 80 to 313 cm) for males, and 61 inches or 155 cm
    (range of 80 to 214 cm) for females.\n\n\n=== Sections ===\n\n\nIn mammals, the
    colon consists of six sections: the cecum, the ascending colon, the transverse
    colon, the descending colon, the sigmoid colon, and the rectum.Sections of the
    colon are:\n\nThe cecum including the appendix\nThe ascending colon\nThe transverse
    colon including the colic flexures and transverse mesocolon\nThe descending colon\nThe
    sigmoid colon \u2013 the s-shaped region of the large intestine\nThe rectumThe
    parts of the colon are either intraperitoneal or behind it in the retroperitoneum.
    \n\nRetroperitoneal organs, in general, do not have a complete covering of peritoneum,
    so they are fixed in location. \n\nIntraperitoneal organs are completely surrounded
    by peritoneum and are therefore mobile. \n\nOf the colon, the ascending colon,
    descending colon and rectum are retroperitoneal, while the cecum, appendix, transverse
    colon and sigmoid colon are intraperitoneal. \n\nThis is important as it affects
    which organs can be easily accessed during surgery, such as a laparotomy.\nIn
    terms of diameter, the cecum is the widest, averaging slightly less than 9 cm
    in healthy individuals, and the transverse colon averages less than 6 cm in diameter.
    \n\nThe descending and sigmoid colon are slightly smaller, with the sigmoid colon
    averaging 4\u20135 cm (1.6\u20132.0 in) in diameter. \n\nDiameters larger than
    certain thresholds for each colonic section can be diagnostic for megacolon.\n\n\n====
    Cecum and appendix ====\nThe cecum is the first section of the colon and involved
    in the digestion, while the appendix which develops embryologically from it,
    is a structure of the colon, not involved in digestion and considered to be part
    of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue. \n\nThe function of the appendix is uncertain,
    but some sources believe that the appendix has a role in housing a sample of
    the colon's microflora, and is able to help to repopulate the colon with bacteria
    if the microflora has been damaged during the course of an immune reaction. \n\nThe
    appendix has also been shown to have a high concentration of lymphatic cells.\n\n\n====
    Ascending colon ====\nThe ascending colon is the first of four main sections
    of the large intestine. \n\nIt is connected to the small intestine by a section
    of bowel called the cecum. \n\nThe ascending colon runs upwards through the abdominal
    cavity toward the transverse colon for approximately eight inches (20 cm).\nOne
    of the main functions of the colon is to remove the water and other key nutrients
    from waste material and recycle it. \n\nAs the waste material exits the small
    intestine through the ileocecal valve, it will move into the cecum and then to
    the ascending colon where this process of extraction starts. \n\nThe waste material
    is pumped upwards toward the transverse colon by peristalsis. \n\nThe ascending
    colon is sometimes attached to the appendix via Gerlach's valve. \n\nIn ruminants,
    the ascending colon is known as the spiral colon.\nTaking into account all ages
    and sexes, colon cancer occurs here most often (41%).\n\n\n==== Transverse colon
    ====\nThe transverse colon is the part of the colon from the hepatic flexure,
    also known as the right colic, (the turn of the colon by the liver) to the splenic
    flexure also known as the left colic, (the turn of the colon by the spleen).
    \n\nThe transverse colon hangs off the stomach, attached to it by a large fold
    of peritoneum called the greater omentum. \n\nOn the posterior side, the transverse
    colon is connected to the posterior abdominal wall by a mesentery known as the
    transverse mesocolon.\nThe transverse colon is encased in peritoneum, and is
    therefore mobile (unlike the parts of the colon immediately before and after
    it).\nThe proximal two-thirds of the transverse colon is perfused by the middle
    colic artery, a branch of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA), while the latter
    third is supplied by branches of the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA). \n\nThe
    \"watershed\" area between these two blood supplies, which represents the embryologic
    division between the midgut and hindgut, is an area sensitive to ischemia.\n\n\n====
    Descending colon ====\nThe descending colon is the part of the colon from the
    splenic flexure to the beginning of the sigmoid colon. \n\nOne function of the
    descending colon in the digestive system is to store feces that will be emptied
    into the rectum. \n\nIt is retroperitoneal in two-thirds of humans. \n\nIn the
    other third, it has a (usually short) mesentery. \n\nThe arterial supply comes
    via the left colic artery. \n\nThe descending colon is also called the distal
    gut, as it is further along the gastrointestinal tract than the proximal gut.
    \n\nGut flora are very dense in this region.\n\n\n==== Sigmoid colon ====\nThe
    sigmoid colon is the part of the large intestine after the descending colon and
    before the rectum. \n\nThe name sigmoid means S-shaped (see sigmoid; cf. sigmoid
    sinus). \n\nThe walls of the sigmoid colon are muscular and contract to increase
    the pressure inside the colon, causing the stool to move into the rectum.\nThe
    sigmoid colon is supplied with blood from several branches (usually between 2
    and 6) of the sigmoid arteries, a branch of the IMA. \n\nThe IMA terminates as
    the superior rectal artery.\nSigmoidoscopy is a common diagnostic technique used
    to examine the sigmoid colon.\n\n\n==== Rectum ====\nThe rectum is the last section
    of the large intestine. \n\nIt holds the formed feces awaiting elimination via
    defecation.\nIt is about 12 cm long.\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\n\nThe cecum \u2013
    the first part of the large intestine\n\nTaeniae coli \u2013 three bands of smooth
    muscle\nHaustra \u2013 bulges caused by contraction of taeniae coli\nEpiploic
    appendages \u2013 small fat accumulations on the visceraThe taenia coli run the
    length of the large intestine. \n\nBecause the taenia coli are shorter than the
    large bowel itself, the colon becomes sacculated, forming the haustra of the
    colon which are the shelf-like intraluminal projections.\n\n\n=== Blood supply
    ===\n\nArterial supply to the colon comes from branches of the superior mesenteric
    artery (SMA) and inferior mesenteric artery (IMA). \n\nFlow between these two
    systems communicates via the marginal artery of the colon that runs parallel
    to the colon for its entire length. \n\nHistorically, a structure variously identified
    as the arc of Riolan or meandering mesenteric artery (of Moskowitz) was thought
    to connect the proximal SMA to the proximal IMA. \n\nThis variably present structure
    would be important if either vessel were occluded. \n\nHowever, at least one
    review of the literature questions the existence of this vessel, with some experts
    calling for the abolition of these terms from future medical literature.Venous
    drainage usually mirrors colonic arterial supply, with the inferior mesenteric
    vein draining into the splenic vein, and the superior mesenteric vein joining
    the splenic vein to form the hepatic portal vein that then enters the liver.\n\n\n===
    Lymphatic drainage ===\n\nLymphatic drainage from the ascending colon and proximal
    two-thirds of the transverse colon is to the colic lymph nodes and the superior
    mesenteric lymph nodes, which drain into the cisterna chyli. \n\nThe lymph from
    the distal one-third of the transverse colon, the descending colon, the sigmoid
    colon, and the upper rectum drain into the inferior mesenteric and colic lymph
    nodes. \n\nThe lower rectum to the anal canal above the pectinate line drain
    to the internal iliac nodes. \n\nThe anal canal below the pectinate line drains
    into the superficial inguinal nodes. \n\nThe pectinate line only roughly marks
    this transition.\n\n\n=== Nerve supply ===\n\nSympathetic supply : Superior &
    inferior mesenteric ganglia\nParasympathetic supply : Vagus & pelvic nerves\n\n\n===
    Development ===\n\n\n\n=== Variation ===\n\nOne variation on the normal anatomy
    of the colon occurs when extra loops form, resulting in a colon that is up to
    five metres longer than normal. \n\nThis condition, referred to as redundant
    colon, typically has no direct major health consequences, though rarely volvulus
    occurs, resulting in obstruction and requiring immediate medical attention. \n\nA
    significant indirect health consequence is that use of a standard adult colonoscope
    is difficult and in some cases impossible when a redundant colon is present,
    though specialized variants on the instrument (including the pediatric variant)
    are useful in overcoming this problem.\n\n\n== Microanatomy ==\n\n\n\n=== Colonic
    crypts ===\n\n\nThe wall of the large intestine is lined with simple columnar
    epithelium with invaginations. \n\nThe invaginations are called the intestinal
    glands or colonic crypts.\n\n        \nThe colon crypts are shaped like microscopic
    thick walled test tubes with a central hole down the length of the tube (the
    crypt lumen). \n\nFour tissue sections are shown here, two cut across the long
    axes of the crypts and two cut parallel to the long axes. \n\nIn these images
    the cells have been stained by immunohistochemistry to show a brown-orange color
    if the cells produce a mitochondrial protein called cytochrome c oxidase subunit
    I (CCOI). \n\nThe nuclei of the cells (located at the outer edges of the cells
    lining the walls of the crypts) are stained blue-gray with haematoxylin. \n\nAs
    seen in panels C and D, crypts are about 75 to about 110 cells long. \n\nBaker
    et al. found that the average crypt circumference is 23 cells. \n\nThus, by the
    images shown here, there are an average of about 1,725 to 2,530 cells per colonic
    crypt. \n\nNooteboom et al. measuring the number of cells in a small number of
    crypts reported a range of 1,500 to 4,900 cells per colonic crypt. \n\nCells
    are produced at the crypt base and migrate upward along the crypt axis before
    being shed into the colonic lumen days later. \n\nThere are 5 to 6 stem cells
    at the bases of the crypts.As estimated from the image in panel A, there are
    about 100 colonic crypts per square millimeter of the colonic epithelium. \n\nSince
    the average length of the human colon is 160.5 cm and the average inner circumference
    of the colon is 6.2 cm, the inner surface epithelial area of the human colon
    has an average area of about 995 cm2, which includes 9,950,000 (close to 10 million)
    crypts.\nIn the four tissue sections shown here, many of the intestinal glands
    have cells with a mitochondrial DNA mutation in the CCOI gene and appear mostly
    white, with their main color being the blue-gray staining of the nuclei. \n\nAs
    seen in panel B, a portion of the stem cells of three crypts appear to have a
    mutation in CCOI, so that 40% to 50% of the cells arising from those stem cells
    form a white segment in the cross cut area.\nOverall, the percent of crypts deficient
    for CCOI is less than 1% before age 40, but then increases linearly with age.
    \n\nColonic crypts deficient for CCOI in women reaches, on average, 18% in women
    and 23% in men by 80\u201384 years of age.Crypts of the colon can reproduce by
    fission, as seen in panel C, where a crypt is fissioning to form two crypts,
    and in panel B where at least one crypt appears to be fissioning. \n\nMost crypts
    deficient in CCOI are in clusters of crypts (clones of crypts) with two or more
    CCOI-deficient crypts adjacent to each other (see panel D).\n\n\n==== Mucosa
    ====\nAbout 150 of the many thousands of protein coding genes expressed in the
    large intestine, some are specific to the mucous membrane in different regions
    and include CEACAM7.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\n\nThe large intestine absorbs water
    and any remaining absorbable nutrients from the food before sending the indigestible
    matter to the rectum. \n\nThe colon absorbs vitamins that are created by the
    colonic bacteria, such as thiamine, riboflavin, and vitamin K (especially important
    as the daily ingestion of vitamin K is not normally enough to maintain adequate
    blood coagulation). \n\nIt also compacts feces, and stores fecal matter in the
    rectum until it can be discharged via the anus in defecation.\nThe large intestine
    also secretes K+ and Cl-. \n\nChloride secretion increases in cystic fibrosis.\nRecycling
    of various nutrients takes place in colon. \n\nExamples include fermentation
    of carbohydrates, short chain fatty acids, and urea cycling.The appendix contains
    a small amount of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue which gives the appendix
    an undetermined role in immunity. \n\nHowever, the appendix is known to be important
    in fetal life as it contains endocrine cells that release biogenic amines and
    peptide hormones important for homeostasis during early growth and development.
    \n\nThe appendix can be removed with no apparent damage or consequence to the
    patient.By the time the chyme has reached this tube, most nutrients and 90% of
    the water have been absorbed by the body. \n\nAt this point some electrolytes
    like sodium, magnesium, and chloride are left as well as indigestible parts of
    ingested food (e.g., a large part of ingested amylose, starch which has been
    shielded from digestion heretofore, and dietary fiber, which is largely indigestible
    carbohydrate in either soluble or insoluble form). \n\nAs the chyme moves through
    the large intestine, most of the remaining water is removed, while the chyme
    is mixed with mucus and bacteria (known as gut flora), and becomes feces. \n\nThe
    ascending colon receives fecal material as a liquid. \n\nThe muscles of the colon
    then move the watery waste material forward and slowly absorb all the excess
    water, causing the stools to gradually solidify as they move along into the descending
    colon.The bacteria break down some of the fiber for their own nourishment and
    create acetate, propionate, and butyrate as waste products, which in turn are
    used by the cell lining of the colon for nourishment. \n\nNo protein is made
    available. \n\nIn humans, perhaps 10% of the undigested carbohydrate thus becomes
    available, though this may vary with diet; in other animals, including other
    apes and primates, who have proportionally larger colons, more is made available,
    thus permitting a higher portion of plant material in the diet. \n\nThe large
    intestine produces no digestive enzymes \u2014 chemical digestion is completed
    in the small intestine before the chyme reaches the large intestine. \n\nThe
    pH in the colon varies between 5.5 and 7 (slightly acidic to neutral).\n\n\n===
    Standing gradient osmosis ===\n\nWater absorption at the colon typically proceeds
    against a transmucosal osmotic pressure gradient. \n\nThe standing gradient osmosis
    is the reabsorption of water against the osmotic gradient in the intestines.
    \n\nCells occupying the intestinal lining pump sodium ions into the intercellular
    space, raising the osmolarity of the intercellular fluid. \n\nThis hypertonic
    fluid creates an osmotic pressure that drives water into the lateral intercellular
    spaces by osmosis via tight junctions and adjacent cells, which then in turn
    moves across the basement membrane and into the capillaries, while more sodium
    ions are pumped again into the intercellular fluid. \n\nAlthough water travels
    down an osmotic gradient in each individual step, overall, water usually travels
    against the osmotic gradient due to the pumping of sodium ions into the intercellular
    fluid. \n\nThis allows the large intestine to absorb water despite the blood
    in capillaries being hypotonic compared to the fluid within the intestinal lumen.\n\n\n===
    Gut flora ===\n\n\nThe large intestine houses over 700 species of bacteria that
    perform a variety of functions, as well as fungi, protozoa, and archaea. \n\nSpecies
    diversity varies by geography and diet. \n\nThe microbes in a human distal gut
    often number in the vicinity of 100 trillion, and can weigh around 200 grams
    (0.44 pounds). \n\nThis mass of mostly symbiotic microbes has recently been called
    the latest human organ to be \"discovered\" or in other words, the \"forgotten
    organ\".The large intestine absorbs some of the products formed by the bacteria
    inhabiting this region. \n\nUndigested polysaccharides (fiber) are metabolized
    to short-chain fatty acids by bacteria in the large intestine and absorbed by
    passive diffusion. \n\nThe bicarbonate that the large intestine secretes helps
    to neutralize the increased acidity resulting from the formation of these fatty
    acids.These bacteria also produce large amounts of vitamins, especially vitamin
    K and biotin (a B vitamin), for absorption into the blood. \n\nAlthough this
    source of vitamins, in general, provides only a small part of the daily requirement,
    it makes a significant contribution when dietary vitamin intake is low. \n\nAn
    individual who depends on absorption of vitamins formed by bacteria in the large
    intestine may become vitamin-deficient if treated with antibiotics that inhibit
    the vitamin producing species of bacteria as well as the intended disease-causing
    bacteria.Other bacterial products include gas (flatus), which is a mixture of
    nitrogen and carbon dioxide, with small amounts of the gases hydrogen, methane,
    and hydrogen sulfide. \n\nBacterial fermentation of undigested polysaccharides
    produces these. \n\nSome of the fecal odor is due to indoles, metabolized from
    the amino acid tryptophan. \n\nThe normal flora is also essential in the development
    of certain tissues, including the cecum and lymphatics.They are also involved
    in the production of cross-reactive antibodies. \n\nThese are antibodies produced
    by the immune system against the normal flora, that are also effective against
    related pathogens, thereby preventing infection or invasion.\nThe two most prevalent
    phyla of the colon are firmicutes and bacteroidetes. \n\nThe ratio between the
    two seems to vary widely as reported by the Human Microbiome Project. \n\nBacteroides
    are implicated in the initiation of colitis and colon cancer. \n\nBifidobacteria
    are also abundant, and are often described as 'friendly bacteria'.A mucus layer
    protects the large intestine from attacks from colonic commensal bacteria.\n\n\n==
    Clinical significance ==\n\n\n\n=== Disease ===\n\n\nFollowing are the most common
    diseases or disorders of the colon:\n\n\n=== Colonoscopy ===\n\n\nColonoscopy
    is the endoscopic examination of the large intestine and the distal part of the
    small bowel with a CCD camera or a fiber optic camera on a flexible tube passed
    through the anus. \n\nIt can provide a visual diagnosis (e.g. ulceration, polyps)
    and grants the opportunity for biopsy or removal of suspected colorectal cancer
    lesions. \n\nColonoscopy can remove polyps as small as one millimetre or less.
    \n\nOnce polyps are removed, they can be studied with the aid of a microscope
    to determine if they are precancerous or not. \n\nIt takes 15 years or less for
    a polyp to turn cancerous.\nColonoscopy is similar to sigmoidoscopy\u2014the
    difference being related to which parts of the colon each can examine. \n\nA
    colonoscopy allows an examination of the entire colon (1200\u20131500 mm in length).
    \n\nA sigmoidoscopy allows an examination of the distal portion (about 600 mm)
    of the colon, which may be sufficient because benefits to cancer survival of
    colonoscopy have been limited to the detection of lesions in the distal portion
    of the colon.A sigmoidoscopy is often used as a screening procedure for a full
    colonoscopy, often done in conjunction with a stool-based test such as a fecal
    occult blood test (FOBT), fecal immunochemical test (FIT), or multi-target stool
    DNA test (Cologuard) or blood-based test, SEPT9 DNA methylation test (Epi proColon).
    \n\nAbout 5% of these screened patients are referred to colonoscopy.Virtual colonoscopy,
    which uses 2D and 3D imagery reconstructed from computed tomography (CT) scans
    or from nuclear magnetic resonance (MR) scans, is also possible, as a totally
    non-invasive medical test, although it is not standard and still under investigation
    regarding its diagnostic abilities. \n\nFurthermore, virtual colonoscopy does
    not allow for therapeutic maneuvers such as polyp/tumour removal or biopsy nor
    visualization of lesions smaller than 5 millimeters. \n\nIf a growth or polyp
    is detected using CT colonography, a standard colonoscopy would still need to
    be performed. \n\nAdditionally, surgeons have lately been using the term pouchoscopy
    to refer to a colonoscopy of the ileo-anal pouch.\n\n\n== Other animals ==\n\nThe
    large intestine is truly distinct only in tetrapods, in which it is almost always
    separated from the small intestine by an ileocaecal valve. \n\nIn most vertebrates,
    however, it is a relatively short structure running directly to the anus, although
    noticeably wider than the small intestine. \n\nAlthough the caecum is present
    in most amniotes, only in mammals does the remainder of the large intestine develop
    into a true colon.In some small mammals, the colon is straight, as it is in other
    tetrapods, but, in the majority of mammalian species, it is divided into ascending
    and descending portions; a distinct transverse colon is typically present only
    in primates. \n\nHowever, the taeniae coli and accompanying haustra are not found
    in either carnivorans or ruminants. \n\nThe rectum of mammals (other than monotremes)
    is derived from the cloaca of other vertebrates, and is, therefore, not truly
    homologous with the \"rectum\" found in these species.In fish, there is no true
    large intestine, but simply a short rectum connecting the end of the digestive
    part of the gut to the cloaca. \n\nIn sharks, this includes a rectal gland that
    secretes salt to help the animal maintain osmotic balance with the seawater.
    \n\nThe gland somewhat resembles a caecum in structure but is not a homologous
    structure.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_intestine"

  descriptionText: "\n\nTONGUE\n\n\nThe tongue is a muscular organ in the mouth of
    a typical tetrapod. \n\nIt manipulates food for mastication and swallowing as
    part of the digestive process, and is the primary organ of taste. \n\nThe tongue's
    upper surface (dorsum) is covered by taste buds housed in numerous lingual papillae.
    \n\nIt is sensitive and kept moist by saliva and is richly supplied with nerves
    and blood vessels. \n\nThe tongue also serves as a natural means of cleaning
    the teeth. \n\nA major function of the tongue is the enabling of speech in humans
    and vocalization in other animals.\nThe human tongue is divided into two parts,
    an oral part at the front and a pharyngeal part at the back. \n\nThe left and
    right sides are also separated along most of its length by a vertical section
    of fibrous tissue (the lingual septum) that results in a groove, the median sulcus,
    on the tongue's surface.\nThere are two groups of muscles of the tongue. \n\nThe
    four intrinsic muscles alter the shape of the tongue and are not attached to
    bone. \n\nThe four paired extrinsic muscles change the position of the tongue
    and are anchored to bone.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe word tongue derives from
    the Old English tunge, which comes from Proto-Germanic *tung\u014Dn. \n\nIt has
    cognates in other Germanic languages\u2014for example tonge in West Frisian,
    tong in Dutch and Afrikaans, Zunge in German, tunge in Danish and Norwegian,
    and tunga in Icelandic, Faroese and Swedish. \n\nThe ue ending of the word seems
    to be a fourteenth-century attempt to show \"proper pronunciation\", but it is
    \"neither etymological nor phonetic\". \n\nSome used the spelling tunge and tonge
    as late as the sixteenth century.\n\n\n== In humans ==\n\n\n\n=== Structure ===\n\n\nThe
    tongue is a muscular hydrostat that forms part of the floor of the oral cavity.
    \n\nThe left and right sides of the tongue are separated by a vertical section
    of fibrous tissue known as the lingual septum. \n\nThis division is along the
    length of the tongue save for the very back of the pharyngeal part and is visible
    as a groove called the median sulcus. \n\nThe human tongue is divided into anterior
    and posterior parts by the terminal sulcus which is a V-shaped groove. \n\nThe
    apex of the terminal sulcus is marked by a blind foramen, the foramen cecum,
    which is a remnant of the median thyroid diverticulum in early embryonic development.
    \n\nThe anterior oral part is the visible part situated at the front and makes
    up roughly two-thirds the length of the tongue. \n\nThe posterior pharyngeal
    part is the part closest to the throat, roughly one-third of its length. \n\nThese
    parts differ in terms of their embryological development and nerve supply.\nThe
    anterior tongue is, at its apex, thin and narrow. \n\nIt is directed forward
    against the lingual surfaces of the lower incisor teeth. \n\nThe posterior part
    is, at its root, directed backward, and connected with the hyoid bone by the
    hyoglossi and genioglossi muscles and the hyoglossal membrane, with the epiglottis
    by three glossoepiglottic folds of mucous membrane, with the soft palate by the
    glossopalatine arches, and with the pharynx by the superior pharyngeal constrictor
    muscle and the mucous membrane. \n\nIt also forms the anterior wall of the oropharynx.\nThe
    average length of the human tongue from the oropharynx to the tip is 10 cm. \n\nThe
    average weight of the human tongue from adult males is 70g and for adult females
    60g.In phonetics and phonology, a distinction is made between the tip of the
    tongue and the blade (the portion just behind the tip). \n\nSounds made with
    the tongue tip are said to be apical, while those made with the tongue blade
    are said to be laminal.\n\n\n==== Upper surface of the tongue ====\n\nThe upper
    surface of the tongue is called the dorsum, and is divided by a groove into symmetrical
    halves by the median sulcus. \n\nThe foramen cecum marks the end of this division
    (at about 2.5 cm from the root of the tongue) and the beginning of the terminal
    sulcus. \n\nThe foramen cecum is also the point of attachment of the thyroglossal
    duct and is formed during the descent of the thyroid diverticulum in embryonic
    development.\nThe terminal sulcus is a shallow groove that runs forward as a
    shallow groove in a V shape from the foramen cecum, forwards and outwards to
    the margins (borders) of the tongue. \n\nThe terminal sulcus divides the tongue
    into a posterior pharyngeal part and an anterior oral part. \n\nThe pharyngeal
    part is supplied by the glossopharyngeal nerve and the oral part is supplied
    by the lingual nerve (a branch of the mandibular branch (V3) of the trigeminal
    nerve) for somatosensory perception and by the chorda tympani (a branch of the
    facial nerve) for taste perception.\nBoth parts of the tongue develop from different
    pharyngeal arches.\n\n\n==== Undersurface of the tongue ====\nOn the undersurface
    of the tongue is a fold of mucous membrane called the frenulum that tethers the
    tongue at the midline to the floor of the mouth. \n\nOn either side of the frenulum
    are small prominences called sublingual caruncles that the major salivary submandibular
    glands drain into.\n\n\n==== Muscles ====\nThe eight muscles of the human tongue
    are classified as either intrinsic or extrinsic. \n\nThe four intrinsic muscles
    act to change the shape of the tongue, and are not attached to any bone. \n\nThe
    four extrinsic muscles act to change the position of the tongue, and are anchored
    to bone.\n\n\n===== Extrinsic =====\n\nThe four extrinsic muscles originate from
    bone and extend to the tongue. \n\nThey are the genioglossus, the hyoglossus
    (often including the chondroglossus) the styloglossus, and the palatoglossus.
    \n\nTheir main functions are altering the tongue's position allowing for protrusion,
    retraction, and side-to-side movement.The genioglossus arises from the mandible
    and protrudes the tongue. \n\nIt is also known as the tongue's \"safety muscle\"
    since it is the only muscle that propels the tongue forward.\nThe hyoglossus,
    arises from the hyoid bone and retracts and depresses the tongue. \n\nThe chondroglossus
    is often included with this muscle.\nThe styloglossus arises from the styloid
    process of the temporal bone and draws the sides of the tongue up to create a
    trough for swallowing.\nThe palatoglossus arises from the palatine aponeurosis,
    and depresses the soft palate, moves the palatoglossal fold towards the midline,
    and elevates the back of the tongue during swallowing.\n\n\n===== Intrinsic =====\n\nFour
    paired intrinsic muscles of the tongue originate and insert within the tongue,
    running along its length. \n\nThey are the superior longitudinal muscle, the
    inferior longitudinal muscle, the vertical muscle, and the transverse muscle.
    \n\nThese muscles alter the shape of the tongue by lengthening and shortening
    it, curling and uncurling its apex and edges as in tongue rolling, and flattening
    and rounding its surface. \n\nThis provides shape and helps facilitate speech,
    swallowing, and eating.The superior longitudinal muscle runs along the upper
    surface of the tongue under the mucous membrane, and elevates, assists in retraction
    of, or deviates the tip of the tongue. \n\nIt originates near the epiglottis,
    at the hyoid bone, from the median fibrous septum.\nThe inferior longitudinal
    muscle lines the sides of the tongue, and is joined to the styloglossus muscle.\nThe
    vertical muscle is located in the middle of the tongue, and joins the superior
    and inferior longitudinal muscles.\nThe transverse muscle divides the tongue
    at the middle, and is attached to the mucous membranes that run along the sides.\n\n\n====
    Blood supply ====\n\nThe tongue receives its blood supply primarily from the
    lingual artery, a branch of the external carotid artery. \n\nThe lingual veins
    drain into the internal jugular vein. \n\nThe floor of the mouth also receives
    its blood supply from the lingual artery. \n\nThere is also a secondary blood
    supply to the root of tongue from the tonsillar branch of the facial artery and
    the ascending pharyngeal artery.\nAn area in the neck sometimes called the Pirogov
    triangle is formed by the intermediate tendon of the digastric muscle, the posterior
    border of the mylohyoid muscle, and the hypoglossal nerve. \n\nThe lingual artery
    is a good place to stop severe hemorrhage from the tongue.\n\n\n==== Nerve supply
    ====\nInnervation of the tongue consists of motor fibers, special sensory fibers
    for taste, and general sensory fibers for sensation.\nMotor supply for all intrinsic
    and extrinsic muscles of the tongue is supplied by efferent motor nerve fibers
    from the hypoglossal nerve (CN XII), with the exception of the palatoglossus,
    which is innervated by the vagus nerve (CN X).Innervation of taste and sensation
    is different for the anterior and posterior part of the tongue because they are
    derived from different embryological structures (pharyngeal arch 1 and pharyngeal
    arches 3 and 4, respectively).\nAnterior two-thirds of tongue (anterior to the
    vallate papillae):\nTaste: chorda tympani branch of the facial nerve (CN VII)
    via special visceral afferent fibers\nSensation: lingual branch of the mandibular
    (V3) division of the trigeminal nerve (CN V) via general visceral afferent fibers\nPosterior
    one third of tongue:\nTaste and sensation: glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX) via
    a mixture of special and general visceral afferent fibers\nBase of tongue\nTaste
    and sensation: internal branch of the superior laryngeal nerve (itself a branch
    of the vagus nerve, CN X)\n\n\n==== Lymphatic drainage ====\nThe tip of tongue
    drains to the submental nodes. \n\nThe left and right halves of the anterior
    two-thirds of the tongue drains to submandibular lymph nodes, while the posterior
    one-third of the tongue drains to the jugulo-omohyoid nodes.\n\n\n==== Microanatomy
    ====\n\nThe upper surface of the tongue is covered in masticatory mucosa, a type
    of oral mucosa which is of keratinized stratified squamous epithelium. \n\nEmbedded
    in this are numerous papillae, some of which house the taste buds and their taste
    receptors. \n\nThe lingual papillae consist of filiform, fungiform, vallate and
    foliate papillae, and only the filiform papillae are not associated with any
    taste buds.\nThe tongue can divide itself in dorsal and ventral surface. \n\nThe
    dorsal surface is a stratified squamous keratinized epithelium which is characterized
    by numerous mucosal projections called papillae. \n\nThe lingual papillae covers
    the dorsal side of the tongue towards the front of the terminal groove. \n\nThe
    ventral surface is stratified squamous non-keratinized epithelium which is smooth.\n\n\n===
    Development ===\n\n\nThe tongue begins to develop in the fourth week of embryonic
    development from a median swelling \u2013 the median tongue bud (tuberculum impar)
    of the first pharyngeal arch.In the fifth week a pair of lateral lingual swellings,
    one on the right side and one on the left, form on the first pharyngeal arch.
    \n\nThese lingual swellings quickly expand and cover the median tongue bud. \n\nThey
    form the anterior part of the tongue that makes up two-thirds of the length of
    the tongue, and continue to develop through prenatal development. \n\nThe line
    of their fusion is marked by the median sulcus.In the fourth week a swelling
    appears from the second pharyngeal arch, in the midline, called the copula. \n\nDuring
    the fifth and sixth weeks the copula is overgrown by a swelling from the third
    and fourth arches (mainly from the third arch) called the hypopharyngeal eminence,
    and this develops into the posterior part of the tongue (the other third). \n\nThe
    hypopharyngeal eminence develops mainly by the growth of endoderm from the third
    pharyngeal arch. \n\nThe boundary between the two parts of the tongue, the anterior
    from the first arch and the posterior from the third arch is marked by the terminal
    sulcus. \n\nThe terminal sulcus is shaped like a V with the tip of the V situated
    posteriorly. \n\nAt the tip of the terminal sulcus is the foramen cecum, which
    is the point of attachment of the thyroglossal duct where the embryonic thyroid
    begins to descend.\n\n\n=== Function ===\n\n\n\n==== Taste ====\n\nChemicals
    that stimulate taste receptor cells are known as tastants. \n\nOnce a tastant
    is dissolved in saliva, it can make contact with the plasma membrane of the gustatory
    hairs, which are the sites of taste transduction.The tongue is equipped with
    many taste buds on its dorsal surface, and each taste bud is equipped with taste
    receptor cells that can sense particular classes of tastes. \n\nDistinct types
    of taste receptor cells respectively detect substances that are sweet, bitter,
    salty, sour, spicy, or taste of umami. \n\nUmami receptor cells are the least
    understood and accordingly are the type most intensively under research.\n\n\n====
    Mastication ====\nThe tongue is an important accessory organ in the digestive
    system. \n\nThe tongue is used for crushing food against the hard palate, during
    mastication and manipulation of food for softening prior to swallowing. \n\nThe
    epithelium on the tongue's upper, or dorsal surface is keratinised. \n\nConsequently,
    the tongue can grind against the hard palate without being itself damaged or
    irritated.\n\n\n==== Speech ====\nThe intrinsic muscles of the tongue enable
    the shaping of the tongue which facilitates speech.\n\n\n==== Intimacy ====\nThe
    tongue plays a role in physical intimacy and sexuality. \n\nThe tongue is part
    of the erogenous zone of the mouth and can be used in intimate contact, as in
    the French kiss and in oral sex. \n\nThe tongue can be used for stimulating the
    clitoris and other areas of the vulva.\n\n\n=== Clinical significance ===\n\n\n\n====
    Disease ====\n\nA congenital disorder of the tongue is that of ankyloglossia
    also known as tongue-tie. \n\nThe tongue is tied to the floor of the mouth by
    a very short and thickened frenulum and this affects speech, eating, and swallowing.\nThe
    tongue is prone to several pathologies including glossitis and other inflammations
    such as geographic tongue, and median rhomboid glossitis; burning mouth syndrome,
    oral hairy leukoplakia, oral candidiasis (thrush), black hairy tongue and fissured
    tongue.\nThere are several types of oral cancer that mainly affect the tongue.
    \n\nMostly these are squamous cell carcinomas.Food debris, desquamated epithelial
    cells and bacteria often form a visible tongue coating. \n\nThis coating has
    been identified as a major factor contributing to bad breath (halitosis), which
    can be managed by using a tongue cleaner.\n\n\n==== Medication delivery ====\nThe
    sublingual region underneath the front of the tongue is an ideal location for
    the administration of certain medications into the body. \n\nThe oral mucosa
    is very thin underneath the tongue, and is underlain by a plexus of veins. \n\nThe
    sublingual route takes advantage of the highly vascular quality of the oral cavity,
    and allows for the speedy application of medication into the cardiovascular system,
    bypassing the gastrointestinal tract. \n\nThis is the only convenient and efficacious
    route of administration (apart from Intravenous therapy) of nitroglycerin to
    a patient suffering chest pain from angina pectoris.\n\n\n== Other animals ==\n\n\nThe
    muscles of the tongue evolved in amphibians from occipital somites. \n\nMost
    amphibians show a proper tongue after their metamorphosis. \n\nAs a consequence
    most vertebrate animals\u2014amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals\u2014have
    tongues (the frog family of pipids lack tongue). \n\nIn mammals such as dogs
    and cats, the tongue is often used to clean the fur and body by licking. \n\nThe
    tongues of these species have a very rough texture which allows them to remove
    oils and parasites. \n\nSome dogs have a tendency to consistently lick a part
    of their foreleg which can result in a skin condition known as a lick granuloma.
    \n\nA dog's tongue also acts as a heat regulator. \n\nAs a dog increases its
    exercise the tongue will increase in size due to greater blood flow. \n\nThe
    tongue hangs out of the dog's mouth and the moisture on the tongue will work
    to cool the bloodflow.Some animals have tongues that are specially adapted for
    catching prey. \n\nFor example, chameleons, frogs, pangolins and anteaters have
    prehensile tongues.\nOther animals may have organs that are analogous to tongues,
    such as a butterfly's proboscis or a radula on a mollusc, but these are not homologous
    with the tongues found in vertebrates and often have little resemblance in function.
    \n\nFor example, butterflies do not lick with their proboscides; they suck through
    them, and the proboscis is not a single organ, but two jaws held together to
    form a tube. \n\nMany species of fish have small folds at the base of their mouths
    that might informally be called tongues, but they lack a muscular structure like
    the true tongues found in most tetrapods.\n\n\n== Society and culture ==\n\n\n\n===
    Figures of speech ===\n\nThe tongue can be used as a metonym for language. \n\nFor
    example, the New Testament of the Bible, in the Book of Acts of the Apostles,
    Jesus' disciples on the Day of Pentecost received a type of spiritual gift: \"there
    appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them.
    \n\nAnd they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other
    tongues ....\", which amazed the crowd of Jewish people in Jerusalem, who were
    from various parts of the Roman Empire but could now understand what was being
    preached. \n\nThe phrase mother tongue is used as a child's first language. \n\nMany
    languages have the same word for \"tongue\" and \"language\".\nA common temporary
    failure in word retrieval from memory is referred to as the tip-of-the-tongue
    phenomenon. \n\nThe expression tongue in cheek refers to a statement that is
    not to be taken entirely seriously \u2013 something said or done with subtle
    ironic or sarcastic humour. \n\nA tongue twister is a phrase made specifically
    to be very difficult to pronounce. \n\nAside from being a medical condition,
    \"tongue-tied\" means being unable to say what you want due to confusion or restriction.
    \n\nThe phrase \"cat got your tongue\" refers to when a person is speechless.
    \n\nTo \"bite one's tongue\" is a phrase which describes holding back an opinion
    to avoid causing offence. \n\nA \"slip of the tongue\" refers to an unintentional
    utterance, such as a Freudian slip. \n\nThe \"gift of tongues\" refers to when
    one is uncommonly gifted to be able to speak in a foreign language, often as
    a type of spiritual gift. \n\nSpeaking in tongues is a common phrase used to
    describe glossolalia, which is to make smooth, language-resembling sounds that
    is no true spoken language itself. \n\nA deceptive person is said to have a forked
    tongue, and a smooth-talking person said to have a silver tongue.\n\n\n=== Gestures
    ===\n\nSticking one's tongue out at someone is considered a childish gesture
    of rudeness or defiance in many countries; the act may also have sexual connotations,
    depending on the way in which it is done. \n\nHowever, in Tibet it is considered
    a greeting. \n\nIn 2009, a farmer from Fabriano, Italy, was convicted and fined
    by the country's highest court for sticking his tongue out at a neighbor with
    whom he had been arguing. \n\nProof of the affront had been captured with a cell
    phone camera.\n\n\n=== Body art ===\n\nTongue piercing and splitting have become
    more common in western countries in recent decades. \n\nIn one study, one-fifth
    of young adults were found to have at least one type of oral piercing, most commonly
    the tongue.\n\n\n=== As food ===\n\n\nThe tongues of some animals are consumed
    and sometimes considered delicacies. \n\nHot tongue sandwiches are frequently
    found on menus in kosher delicatessens in America. \n\nTaco de lengua (lengua
    being Spanish for tongue) is a taco filled with beef tongue, and is especially
    popular in Mexican cuisine. \n\nAs part of Colombian gastronomy, Tongue in Sauce
    (Lengua en Salsa), is a dish prepared by frying the tongue, adding tomato sauce,
    onions and salt. \n\nTongue can also be prepared as birria. \n\nPig and beef
    tongue are consumed in Chinese cuisine. \n\nDuck tongues are sometimes employed
    in Szechuan dishes, while lamb's tongue is occasionally employed in Continental
    and contemporary American cooking. \n\nFried cod \"tongue\" is a relatively common
    part of fish meals in Norway and Newfoundland. \n\nIn Argentina and Uruguay cow
    tongue is cooked and served in vinegar (lengua a la vinagreta). \n\nIn the Czech
    Republic and Poland, a pork tongue is considered a delicacy, and there are many
    ways of preparing it. \n\nIn Eastern Slavic countries, pork and beef tongues
    are commonly consumed, boiled and garnished with horseradish or jelled; beef
    tongues fetch a significantly higher price and are considered more of a delicacy.
    \n\nIn Alaska, cow tongues are among the more common.\nTongues of seals and whales
    have been eaten, sometimes in large quantities, by sealers and whalers, and in
    various times and places have been sold for food on shore.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongue"

  descriptionText: "\n\nRENAL PELVIS\n\n\nThe renal pelvis or pelvis of the kidney
    is the funnel-like dilated part of the ureter in the kidney. \n\nIn humans, the
    renal pelvis is the point where the two or three major calyces join. \n\nIt has
    a mucous membrane and is covered with transitional epithelium and an underlying
    lamina propria of loose-to-dense connective tissue.\nThe renal pelvis functions
    as a funnel for urine flowing to the ureter.\nThe renal pelvis is the location
    of several kinds of kidney cancer and is affected by infection in pyelonephritis.\n\n\n==
    Clinical significance ==\n\nThe renal pelvis is the location of several kinds
    of kidney cancer and is affected by infection in pyelonephritis. \n\nA large
    \"staghorn\" kidney stone may block all or part of the renal pelvis.\nThe size
    of the renal pelvis plays a major role in the grading of hydronephrosis. \n\nNormally,
    the anteroposterior diameter of the renal pelvis is less than 4 mm in fetuses
    up to 32 weeks of gestational age and 7 mm afterwards. \n\nIn adults, 13% of
    the normal population have a transverse pelvic diameter of over 10 mm.\n\n\n==
    Etymology and pronunciation ==\n\nLike the bony pelvis, the renal pelvis () gets
    its English name via New Latin from the older Latin word pelvis, \"basin\", as
    in \"wash basin\". \n\nIn both cases the name reflects the shape of the structure,
    and in the case of the renal pelvis, it also reflects the function. \n\nThe name
    reflects that each renal pelvis collects urine from the calyces and funnels it
    into the ureter like a wash basin collects water and funnels it into a drain
    pipe. \n\nThe renal pelvis is occasionally called the pyelum (from Greek \u03C0\u03CD\u03B5\u03BB\u03BF\u03C2
    p\xFDelos, \"trough\", \u2018anything hollow\u2019), and the combining form pyelo-
    denotes the renal pelvis (pyelo- is not to be confused with pyo-). \n\nThe words
    infundibulum and choana are other words for funnel-shaped cavities (which medical
    English got from the Latin and Greek words for \"funnel\", respectively), and
    the renal pelvis is sometimes called the renal infundibulum. \n\nThe form *renal
    choana is logical but is not used.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_pelvis"

  descriptionText: "\n\nSEMINAL GLANDS/SEMINAL VESICLES\n\n\nThe seminal vesicles
    (also called vesicular glands, or seminal glands) are a pair of two convoluted
    tubular glands that lie behind the urinary bladder of some male mammals. \n\nThey
    secrete fluid that partly composes the semen.\n\nThe vesicles are 5\u201310 cm
    in size, 3\u20135 cm in diameter, and are located between the bladder and the
    rectum. \n\nThey have multiple outpouchings which contain secretory glands, which
    join together with the vas deferens as the ejaculatory duct. \n\nThey receive
    blood from the vesiculodeferential artery, and drain into the vesiculodeferential
    veins. \n\nThe glands are lined with column-shaped and cuboidal cells. \n\nThe
    vesicles are present in many groups of mammals, but not marsupials, monotremes
    or carnivores.\n\nInflammation of the seminal vesicles is called seminal vesiculitis,
    most often is due to bacterial infection as a result of a sexually transmitted
    disease or following a surgical procedure. \n\nSeminal vesiculitis can cause
    pain in the lower abdomen, scrotum, penis or peritoneum, painful ejaculation,
    and blood in the semen. \n\nIt is usually treated with antibiotics, although
    may require surgical drainage in complicated cases. \n\nOther conditions may
    affect the vesicles, including congenital abnormalities such as failure or incomplete
    formation, and, uncommonly, tumours.\n\nThe seminal vesicles have been described
    as early as the second century AD by Galen, although the vesicles only received
    their name much later, as they were initially described using the term from which
    the word prostate is derived.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe seminal vesicles are
    a pair of glands in males that are positioned below the urinary bladder and at
    the end of the vasa deferentia, where they enter the prostate. \n\nEach vesicle
    is a coiled and folded tube, with occasional outpouchings termed diverticula
    in its wall. \n\nThe lower part of the tube ends as a straight tube called the
    excretory duct which joins with the vas deferens of that side of the body to
    form an ejaculatory duct. \n\nThe ejaculatory ducts pass through the prostate
    gland before opening separately into the verumontanum of the prostatic urethra.
    \n\nThe vesicles are between 5\u201310 cm in size, 3\u20135 cm in diameter, and
    have a volume of around 13 mL.The vesicles receive blood supply from the vesiculodeferential
    artery, and also from the inferior vesical artery. \n\nThe vesiculodeferential
    artery arises from the umbilical arteries, which branch directly from the internal
    iliac arteries. \n\nBlood is drained into the vesiculodeferential veins and the
    inferior vesical plexus, which drain into the internal iliac veins. \n\nLymphatic
    drainage occurs along the venous routes, draining into the internal iliac nodes.The
    vesicles lie behind the bladder at the end of the vasa deferentia. \n\nThey lie
    in the space between the bladder and the rectum; the bladder and prostate lie
    in front, the tip of the ureter as it enters the bladder above, and Denonvilliers
    fascia and the rectum behind.\n\n\n=== Development ===\n\n\nIn the developing
    embryo, at the hind end lies a cloaca. \n\nThis, over the fourth to the seventh
    week, divides into a urogenital sinus and the beginnings of the anal canal, with
    a wall forming between these two inpouchings called the urorectal septum. \n\nTwo
    ducts form next to each other that connect to the urogenital sinus; the mesonephric
    duct and the paramesonephric duct, which go on to form the reproductive tracts
    of the male and female respectively.In the male, under the influence of testosterone,
    the mesonephric duct proliferates, forming the epididymis, ductus deferens and,
    via a small outpouching near the developing prostate, the seminal vesicles. \n\nSertoli
    cells secrete anti-mullerian hormone, which causes the paramesonephric duct to
    regress.\n\nThe development and maintenance of the seminal vesicles, as well
    as their secretion and size/weight, are highly dependent on androgens. \n\nThe
    seminal vesicles contain 5\u03B1-reductase, which metabolizes testosterone into
    its much more potent metabolite, dihydrotestosterone (DHT). \n\nThe seminal vesicles
    have also been found to contain luteinizing hormone receptors, and hence may
    also be regulated by the ligand of this receptor, luteinizing hormone.\n\n\n===
    Microanatomy ===\n\nThe inner lining of the seminal vesicles (the epithelium)
    is made of a lining of interspersed column-shaped and cube-shaped cells. \n\nThere
    are varying descriptions of the lining as being pseudostratified and consisting
    of column-shaped cells only. \n\nWhen viewed under a microscope, the cells are
    seen to have large bubbles in their interior. \n\nThis is because their interior,
    called cytoplasm, contains lipid droplets involved in secretion during ejaculation.
    \n\nThe tissue of the seminal vesicles is full of glands, spaced irregularly.
    \n\nAs well as glands, the seminal vesicles contain smooth muscle and connective
    tissue. \n\nThis fibrous and muscular tissue surrounds the glands, helping to
    expel their contents. \n\nThe outer surface of the glands is covered in peritoneum.\n\n\t\t\n==
    Function ==\n\nThe seminal vesicles secrete a significant proportion of the fluid
    that ultimately becomes semen. \n\nFluid is secreted from the ejaculatory ducts
    of the vesicles into the vas deferens, where it becomes part of semen. \n\nThis
    then passes through the urethra, where it is ejaculated during a male sexual
    response.About 70-85% of the seminal fluid in humans originates from the seminal
    vesicles. \n\nThe fluid consists of nutrients including fructose and citric acid,
    prostaglandins, and fibrinogen. \n\nNutrients help support sperm until fertilisation
    occurs; prostaglandins may also assist by softening mucous of the cervix, and
    by causing reverse contractions of parts of the female reproductive tract such
    as the fallopian tubes, to ensure that sperm are less likely to be expelled.\n\n\n==
    Clinical significance ==\n\n\n\n=== Disease ===\n\nSeminal vesiculitis (also
    known as spermatocystitis) is an inflammation of the seminal vesicles, most often
    caused by bacterial infection. \n\nSymptoms can include vague back or lower abdominal
    pain; pain of the penis, scrotum or peritoneum; painful ejaculation; blood in
    the semen on ejaculation; irritative and obstructive voiding symptoms; and impotence.
    \n\nInfection may be due to sexually transmitted infections, as a complication
    of a procedure such as prostate biopsy. \n\nIt is usually treated with antibiotics.
    \n\nIf a person experiences ongoing discomfort, transurethral seminal vesiculoscopy
    may be considered. \n\nIntervention in the form of drainage through the skin
    or surgery may also be required if the infection becomes an abscess. \n\nThe
    seminal vesicles may also be affected by tuberculosis, schistosomiasis and hydatid
    disease. \n\nThese diseases are investigated, diagnosed and treated according
    to the underlying disease.\n\nCongenital anomalies associated with the seminal
    vesicles include failure to develop, either completely (agenesis) or partially
    (hypoplasia), and cysts. \n\nFailure of the vesicles to form is often associated
    with absent vas deferens, or an abnormal connection between the vas deferens
    and the ureter. \n\nThe seminal vesicles may also be affected by cysts, amyloidosis,
    and stones. \n\nStones or cysts that become infected, or obstruct the vas deferens
    or seminal vesicles, may require surgical intervention.\n\nBenign tumours of
    the seminal vesicles are rare. \n\nWhen they do occur, they are usually papillary
    adenomas and cystadenomas. \n\nThey do not cause elevation of tumour markers,
    and are usually diagnosed based examination of tissue that has been removed after
    surgery. \n\nPrimary adenocarcinoma of the seminal vesicles, although rare, constitutes
    the most common malignant cancer of the seminal vesicles; that said, the majority
    of malignant cancers affecting the vesicles are lesions that have extended into
    the vesicles from nearby parts of the body. \n\nWhen adenocarcinoma occurs, it
    can cause blood in the urine, blood in the semen, painful urination, urinary
    retention, or even urinary obstruction. \n\nAdenocarcinomata are usually diagnosed
    after they are excised, based on tissue diagnosis. \n\nSome produce the tumour
    marker Ca-125, which can be used to monitor for reoccurence afterwards. \n\nEven
    rarer neoplasms include sarcoma, squamous cell carcinoma, yolk sac tumor, neuroendocrine
    carcinoma, paraganglioma, epithelial stromal tumors and lymphoma.\n\n\n=== Investigations
    ===\n\nSymptoms due to diseases of the seminal vesicles may be vague and not
    able to be specifically attributable to the vesicles themselves; additionally,
    some conditions such as tumours or cysts may not cause any symptoms at all. \n\nWhen
    diseases is suspected, such as due to pain on ejaculation, blood in the urine,
    infertility, due to urinary tract obstruction, further investigations may be
    conducted.\n\nA digital rectal examination, which involves a finger inserted
    by a medical practitioner through the anus, may cause greater than usual tenderness
    of the prostate gland, or may reveal a large seminal vesicle. \n\nA urine specimen
    may be collected, and is likely to demonstrate blood within the urine. \n\nLaboratory
    examination of seminal vesicle fluid requires a semen sample, e.g. for semen
    culture or semen analysis. \n\nFructose levels provide a measure of seminal vesicle
    function and, if absent, bilateral agenesis or obstruction is suspected.\n\nImaging
    of the vesicles is provided by medical imaging; either by transrectal ultrasound,
    CT or MRI scans. \n\nAn examination using cystoscopy, where a flexible tube is
    inserted in the urethra, may show disease of the vesicles because of changes
    in the normal appearance of the nearby bladder trigone, or prostatic urethra.\n\n\n==
    Other animals ==\n\nThe evolution of seminal vesicles may have been influenced
    by sexual selection. \n\nThey occur in many groups of mammals, but are absent
    in marsupials, monotremes, and carnivores. \n\nThe function is similar in all
    mammals they are present in, which is to secrete a fluid as part of semen that
    is ejaculated during the sexual response.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe action of
    the seminal vesicles has been described as early the second century AD by Galen,
    as \"glandular bodies\" that secrete substances alongside semen during reproduction.
    \n\nBy the time of Herophilus the presence of the glands and associated ducts
    had been described. \n\nAround the time of the early 17th century the word used
    to describe the vesicles, parastatai, eventually and unambiguously was used to
    refer to the prostate gland, rather than the vesicles. \n\nThe first time the
    prostate was portrayed in an individual drawing was by Reiner De Graaf in 1678.\n\nThe
    first described use of laparoscopic surgery on the vesicles was described in
    1993; this is now the preferred approach because of decreased pain, complications,
    and a shorter hospital stay.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seminal_vesicles"

  descriptionText: "\n\nADENOHYPOPHYSIS/ANTERIOR PITUITARY\n\n\nA major organ of
    the endocrine system, the anterior pituitary (also called the adenohypophysis
    or pars anterior) is the glandular, anterior lobe that together with the posterior
    lobe (posterior pituitary, or the neurohypophysis) makes up the pituitary gland
    (hypophysis). \n\nThe anterior pituitary regulates several physiological processes,
    including stress, growth, reproduction, and lactation. \n\nProper functioning
    of the anterior pituitary and of the organs it regulates can often be ascertained
    via blood tests that measure hormone levels.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\n\nThe pituitary
    gland sits in a protective bony enclosure called the sella turcica (Turkish chair/saddle).
    \n\nIt is composed of three lobes: the anterior, intermediate, and posterior
    lobes. \n\nIn many animals, these lobes are distinct. \n\nHowever, in humans,
    the intermediate lobe is but a few cell layers thick and indistinct; as a result,
    it is often considered part of the anterior pituitary. \n\nIn all animals, the
    fleshy, glandular anterior pituitary is distinct from the neural composition
    of the posterior pituitary.\n\nThe anterior pituitary is composed of three regions:\n\nPars
    distalisThe pars distalis (distal part) comprises the majority of the anterior
    pituitary and is where the bulk of pituitary hormone production occurs. \n\nThe
    pars distalis contains two types of cells, including chromophobe cells and chromophil
    cells. \n\nThe chromophils can be further divided into acidophils (alpha cells)
    and basophils (beta cells). \n\nThese cells all together produce hormones of
    the anterior pituitary and release them into the blood stream.\n\nNota bene:
    The terms \"basophil\" and \"acidophil\" are used by some books, whereas others
    prefer not to use these terms. \n\nThis is due to the possible confusion with
    white blood cells, where one may also find basophils and acidophils.\n\n\t\t\nPars
    tuberalis\nThe pars tuberalis (tubular part) forms a part of the sheath extending
    up from the pars distalis, which joins with the pituitary stalk (also known as
    the infundibular stalk or infundibulum), arising from the posterior lobe. \n\n(The
    pituitary stalk connects the hypothalamus to the posterior pituitary.) The function
    of the pars tuberalis is poorly understood. \n\nHowever, it has been seen to
    be important in receiving the endocrine signal in the form of TSHB (a \u03B2
    subunit of TSH), informing the pars tuberalis of the photoperiod (length of day).
    \n\nThe expression of this subunit is regulated by the secretion of melatonin
    in response to light information transmitted to the pineal gland. \n\nEarlier
    studies have shown localization of melatonin receptors in this region.\n\nPars
    intermedia\nThe pars intermedia (intermediate part) sits between the pars distalis
    and the posterior pituitary, forming the boundary between the anterior and posterior
    pituitaries. \n\nIt is very small and indistinct in humans.\n\n\n=== Development
    ===\n\nThe anterior pituitary is derived from the ectoderm, more specifically
    from that of Rathke\u2019s pouch, part of the developing hard palate in the embryo.Rathke\u2019s
    pouch is also ectodermal in origin.\n\nThe pouch eventually loses its connection
    with the pharynx, giving rise to the anterior pituitary. \n\nThe anterior wall
    of Rathke's pouch proliferates, filling most of the pouch to form the pars distalis
    and the pars tuberalis. \n\nThe posterior wall of the anterior pituitary forms
    the pars intermedia. \n\nIts formation from the soft tissues of the upper palate
    contrasts with the posterior pituitary, which originates from neuroectoderm.\n\n\n==
    Function ==\n\nThe anterior pituitary contains five types of endocrine cell,
    and they are defined by the hormones they secrete: somatotropes (GH); Lactotropes
    (PRL); gonadotropes (LH and FSH); corticotropes (ACTH) and thyrotropes (TSH).
    \n\nIt also contains non-endocrine folliculostellate cells which are thought
    to stimulate and support the endocrine cell populations.\n\nHormones secreted
    by the anterior pituitary are trophic hormones (Greek: trophe, \u201Cnourishment\u201D).
    \n\nTrophic hormones directly affect growth either as hyperplasia or hypertrophy
    on the tissue it is stimulating. \n\nTropic hormones are named for their ability
    to act directly on target tissues or other endocrine glands to release hormones,
    causing numerous cascading physiological responses.\n\n\n=== Role in the endocrine
    system ===\n\n\nHypothalamic controlHormone secretion from the anterior pituitary
    gland is regulated by hormones secreted by the hypothalamus. \n\nNeuroendocrine
    cells in the hypothalamus project axons to the median eminence, at the base of
    the brain. \n\nAt this site, these cells can release substances into small blood
    vessels that travel directly to the anterior pituitary gland (the hypothalamo-hypophyseal
    portal vessels).\n\nOther Control MechanismsAside from hypothalamic control of
    the anterior pituitary, other systems in the body have been shown to regulate
    the anterior pituitary\u2019s function. \n\nGABA can either stimulate or inhibit
    the secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH) and growth hormone (GH) and can stimulate
    the secretion of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). \n\nProstaglandins are now
    known to inhibit adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and also to stimulate TSH,
    GH and LH release. \n\nGABA, through action with the hypothalamus, has been shown
    experimentally to influence the level of GH secretion. \n\nClinical evidence
    supports the experimental findings of the excitatory and inhibitory effects GABA
    has on GH secretion, dependent on GABA\u2019s site of action within the hypothalamic-pituitary
    unit.\n\n\n=== Effects of the anterior pituitary ===\n\nThermal homeostasisThe
    homeostatic maintenance of the anterior pituitary is crucial to our physiological
    well being. \n\nIncreased plasma levels of TSH induce hyperthermia through a
    mechanism involving increased metabolism and cutaneous vasodilation. \n\nIncreased
    levels of LH also result in hypothermia but through a decreased metabolism action.
    \n\nACTH increase metabolism and induce cutaneous vasoconstriction, increased
    plasma levels also result in hyperthermia and prolactin decreases with decreasing
    temperature values. \n\nFollicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) also may cause hypothermia
    if increased beyond homeostatic levels through an increased metabolic mechanism
    only.\n\nGonadal function\nGonadotropes, primarily luteinising hormone (LH) secreted
    from the anterior pituitary stimulates the ovulation cycle in female mammals,
    whilst in the males, LH stimulates the synthesis of androgen which drives the
    ongoing will to mate together with a constant production of sperm.\n\nHPA axis\nHypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
    axis\nThe anterior pituitary plays a role in stress response. \n\nCorticotropin
    releasing hormone (CRH) from the hypothalamus stimulates ACTH release in a cascading
    effect that ends with the production of glucocorticoids from the adrenal cortex.\n\n\n===
    Behavioral effects ===\n\nDevelopment\nThe release of GH, LH, and FSH are required
    for correct human development, including gonadal development.\n\nBreast-feeding\nRelease
    of the hormone prolactin is essential for lactation.\nStress\nOperating through
    the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA), the anterior pituitary gland has
    a large role in the neuroendocrine system\u2019s stress response. \n\nStress
    induces a release of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and vasopressin from
    the hypothalamus, which activates the release of adrenocorticotropic hormone
    (ACTH) from the anterior pituitary gland. \n\nThen, this acts on the adrenal
    cortex to produce glucocorticoids such as cortisol. \n\nThese glucocorticoids
    act back on the anterior pituitary gland and the hypothalamus with negative feedback
    to slow the production of CRH and ACTH. \n\nIncreased cortisol under stress conditions
    can cause the following: metabolic effects (mobilization of glucose, fatty acids,
    and amino acids), bone re-absorption (calcium mobilization), activation of the
    sympathetic nervous system response (fight or flight), anti-inflammatory effects,
    and inhibition of reproduction/growth. \n\nWhen the anterior pituitary gland
    is removed (hypophysectomy) in rats, their avoidance learning mechanisms were
    slowed, but injections of ACTH restored their performance. \n\nIn addition, stress
    may delay the release of reproductive hormones such as luteinizing hormone (LH)
    and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). \n\nThis shows that the anterior pituitary
    gland is involved in behavioral functions as well as being part of a larger pathway
    for stress responses. \n\nIt is also known that (HPA) hormones are related to
    certain skin diseases and skin homeostasis. \n\nThere is evidence linking hyperactivity
    of HPA hormones to stress-related skin diseases and skin tumors.\n\nAging\nOperating
    through the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, the anterior pituitary gland
    also affects the reproductive system. \n\nThe hypothalamus releases gonadotropin-releasing
    hormone (GnRH), which stimulates the release of luteinizing hormone (LH) and
    follicle-stimulating hormone. \n\nThen the gonads produce estrogen and testosterone.
    \n\nThe decrease in release of gonadotropins (LH and FSH) caused by normal aging
    may be responsible for impotence and frailty in elderly men because of the eventual
    decrease in production of testosterone. \n\nThis lower level of testosterone
    can have other effects, such as reduced libido, well-being and mood, muscle and
    bone strength, and metabolism.\n\nTactile responding\nIt has been shown that
    infant mice who were stroked with a paintbrush (simulating motherly care) had
    more release and binding of growth hormone (GH) from the anterior pituitary gland.Circadian
    rhythms\n\nLight information received by the eyes is transmitted to the pineal
    gland via the circadian pacemaker (the suprachiasmatic nucleus). \n\nDiminishing
    light stimulates the release of melatonin from the pineal gland which can also
    affect the secretion levels in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. \n\nMelatonin
    can lower levels of LH and FSH, which will decrease levels of estrogen and testosterone.
    \n\nIn addition, melatonin may affect production of prolactin.\n\n\n== Clinical
    significance ==\n\n\n=== Increased activity ===\n\nHyperpituitarism is the condition
    where the pituitary secretes excessive amounts of hormones. \n\nThis hypersecretion
    often results in the formation of a pituitary adenoma (tumour), which are benign
    apart from a tiny fraction. \n\nThere are mainly three types of anterior pituitary
    tumors and their associated disorders. \n\nFor example, acromegaly results from
    excessive secretion of growth hormone (GH) often being released by a pituitary
    adenoma. \n\nThis disorder can cause disfigurement and possibly death and can
    lead to gigantism, a hormone disorder shown in \u201Cgiants\u201D such as Andr\xE9
    the Giant, where it occurs before the epiphyseal plates in bones close in puberty.
    \n\nThe most common type of pituitary tumour is a prolactinoma which hypersecretes
    prolactin. \n\nA third type of pituitary adenoma secretes excess ACTH, which
    in turn, causes an excess of cortisol to be secreted and is the cause of Cushing's
    disease.\n\n\n=== Decreased activity ===\n\n\nHypopituitarism is characterized
    by a decreased secretion of hormones released by the anterior pituitary. \n\nFor
    example, hypo-secretion of GH prior to puberty can be a cause of dwarfism. \n\nIn
    addition, secondary adrenal insufficiency can be caused by hypo-secretion of
    ACTH which, in turn, does not signal the adrenal cortex to produce a sufficient
    amount of cortisol. \n\nThis is a life-threatening condition. \n\nHypopituitarism
    could be caused by the destruction or removal of the anterior pituitary tissue
    through traumatic brain injury, tumor, tuberculosis, or syphilis, among other
    causes. \n\nThis disorder used to be referred to as Simmonds' disease but now
    according to the Diseases Database it is called Sheehan syndrome. \n\nIf the
    hypopituitarism is caused by the blood loss associated with childbirth, the disorder
    is referred to as Sheehan syndrome.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Etymology ===\n\nThe
    anterior pituitary is also known as the adenohypophysis, meaning \"glandular
    undergrowth\", from the Greek adeno- (\"gland\"), hypo (\"under\"), and physis
    (\"growth\").\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_pituitary"

  descriptionText: "\n\nBRONCHUS\n\n\nA bronchus is a passage or airway in the lower
    respiratory tract that conducts air into the lungs. \n\nThe first or primary
    bronchi to branch from the trachea at the carina are the right main bronchus
    and the left main bronchus. \n\nThese are the widest bronchi, and enter the right
    lung, and the left lung at each hilum. \n\nThe main bronchi branch into narrower
    secondary bronchi or lobar bronchi, and these branch into narrower tertiary bronchi
    or segmental bronchi. \n\nFurther divisions of the segmental bronchi are known
    as 4th order, 5th order, and 6th order segmental bronchi, or grouped together
    as subsegmental bronchi.\n\nThe bronchi when too narrow to be supported by cartilage
    are known as bronchioles. \n\nNo gas exchange takes place in the bronchi.\n\n\n==
    Structure ==\n\nThe trachea (windpipe) divides at the carina into two main or
    primary bronchi, the left bronchus and the right bronchus. \n\nThe carina of
    the trachea is located at the level of the sternal angle and the fifth thoracic
    vertebra (at rest).\n\nThe right main bronchus is wider, shorter, and more vertical
    than the left main bronchus, its mean length is 1.09 cm. \n\nIt enters the root
    of the right lung at approximately the fifth thoracic vertebra. \n\nThe right
    main bronchus subdivides into three secondary bronchi (also known as lobar bronchi),
    which deliver oxygen to the three lobes of the right lung\u2014the superior,
    middle and inferior lobe. \n\nThe azygos vein arches over it from behind; and
    the right pulmonary artery lies at first below and then in front of it. \n\nAbout
    2 cm from its commencement it gives off a branch to the superior lobe of the
    right lung, which is also called the eparterial bronchus. \n\nEparterial refers
    to its position above the right pulmonary artery. \n\nThe right bronchus now
    passes below the artery, and is known as the hyparterial branch which divides
    into the two lobar bronchi to the middle and lower lobes.\n\nThe left main bronchus
    is smaller in caliber but longer than the right, being 5 cm long. \n\nIt enters
    the root of the left lung opposite the sixth thoracic vertebra. \n\nIt passes
    beneath the aortic arch, crosses in front of the esophagus, the thoracic duct,
    and the descending aorta, and has the left pulmonary artery lying at first above,
    and then in front of it. \n\nThe left bronchus has no eparterial branch, and
    therefore it has been supposed by some that there is no upper lobe to the left
    lung, but that the so-called upper lobe corresponds to the middle lobe of the
    right lung. \n\nThe left main bronchus divides into two secondary bronchi or
    lobar bronchi, to deliver air to the two lobes of the left lung\u2014the superior
    and the inferior lobe.\n\nThe secondary bronchi divide further into tertiary
    bronchi, (also known as segmental bronchi), each of which supplies a bronchopulmonary
    segment. \n\nA bronchopulmonary segment is a division of a lung separated from
    the rest of the lung by a septum of connective tissue. \n\nThis property allows
    a bronchopulmonary segment to be surgically removed without affecting other segments.
    \n\nInitially, there are ten segments in each lung, but during development with
    the left lung having just two lobes, two pairs of segments fuse to give eight,
    four for each lobe. \n\nThe tertiary bronchi divide further in another three
    branchings known as 4th order, 5th order and 6th order segmental bronchi which
    are also referred to as subsegmental bronchi. \n\nThese branch into many smaller
    bronchioles which divide into terminal bronchioles, each of which then gives
    rise to several respiratory bronchioles, which go on to divide into two to eleven
    alveolar ducts. \n\nThere are five or six alveolar sacs associated with each
    alveolar duct. \n\nThe alveolus is the basic anatomical unit of gas exchange
    in the lung.\nThe main bronchi have relatively large lumens that are lined by
    respiratory epithelium. \n\nThis cellular lining has cilia departing towards
    the mouth which removes dust and other small particles. \n\nThere is a smooth
    muscle layer below the epithelium arranged as two ribbons of muscle that spiral
    in opposite directions. \n\nThis smooth muscle layer contains seromucous glands,
    which secrete mucus, in its wall. \n\nHyaline cartilage is present in the bronchi,
    surrounding the smooth muscle layer. \n\nIn the main bronchi, the cartilage forms
    C-shaped rings like those in the trachea, while in the smaller bronchi, hyaline
    cartilage is present in irregularly arranged crescent-shaped plates and islands.
    \n\nThese plates give structural support to the bronchi and keep the airway open.The
    bronchial wall normally has a thickness of 10% to 20% of the total bronchial
    diameter.\n\n\n=== Microanatomy ===\n\n\nThe cartilage and mucous membrane of
    the main bronchus (primary bronchi) are similar to those in the trachea. \n\nThey
    are lined with respiratory epithelium, which is classified as ciliated pseudostratified
    columnar epithelium. \n\nThe epithelium in the main bronchi contains goblet cells,
    which are glandular, modified simple columnar epithelial cells that produce mucins,
    the main component of mucus. \n\nMucus plays an important role in keeping the
    airways clear in the mucociliary clearance process. \n\nAs branching continues
    through the bronchial tree, the amount of hyaline cartilage in the walls decreases
    until it is absent in the bronchioles. \n\nAs the cartilage decreases, the amount
    of smooth muscle increases. \n\nThe mucous membrane also undergoes a transition
    from ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium, to simple cuboidal epithelium,
    to simple squamous epithelium in the alveolar ducts and alveoli.\n\n\n=== Variation
    ===\n\nIn 0.1 to 5% of people there is a right superior lobe bronchus arising
    from the main stem bronchus prior to the carina. \n\nThis is known as a tracheal
    bronchus, and seen as an anatomical variation. \n\nIt can have multiple variations
    and, although usually asymptomatic, it can be the root cause of pulmonary disease
    such as a recurrent infection. \n\nIn such cases resection is often curative.\n\nThe
    cardiac bronchus has a prevalence of \u22480.3% and presents as an accessory
    bronchus arising from the bronchus intermedius between the upper lobar bronchus
    and the origin of the middle and lower lobar bronchi of the right main bronchus.\n\nAn
    accessory cardiac bronchus is usually an asymptomatic condition but may be associated
    with persistent infection or hemoptysis. \n\nIn about half of observed cases
    the cardiac bronchus presents as a short dead-ending bronchial stump, in the
    remainder the bronchus may exhibit branching and associated aerated lung parenchyma.\n\n\n==
    Function ==\n\n\nThe bronchi function to carry air that is breathed in through
    to the functional tissues of the lungs, called alveoli. \n\nExchange of gases
    between the air in the lungs and the blood in the capillaries occurs across the
    walls of the alveolar ducts and alveoli. \n\nThe alveolar ducts and alveoli consist
    primarily of simple squamous epithelium, which permits rapid diffusion of oxygen
    and carbon dioxide.\n\n\n== Clinical significance ==\n\n\nBronchial wall thickening,
    as can be seen on CT scan, generally (but not always) implies inflammation of
    the bronchi (bronchitis). \n\nNormally, the ratio of the bronchial wall thickness
    and the bronchial diameter is between 0.17 and 0.23.\n\n\n=== Bronchitis ===\n\n\nBronchitis
    is defined as inflammation of the bronchi, which can either be acute or chronic.
    \n\nAcute bronchitis is usually caused by viral or bacterial infections. \n\nMany
    sufferers of chronic bronchitis also suffer from chronic obstructive pulmonary
    disease (COPD), and this is usually associated with smoking or long-term exposure
    to irritants.\n\n\n=== Aspiration ===\n\nThe left main bronchus departs from
    the trachea at a greater angle than that of the right main bronchus. \n\nThe
    right bronchus is also wider than the left and these differences predispose the
    right lung to aspirational problems. \n\nIf food, liquids, or foreign bodies
    are aspirated, they will tend to lodge in the right main bronchus. \n\nBacterial
    pneumonia and aspiration pneumonia may result.\n\nIf a tracheal tube used for
    intubation is inserted too far, it will usually lodge in the right bronchus,
    allowing ventilation only of the right lung.\n\n\n=== Asthma ===\n\nAsthma is
    marked by hyperresponsiveness of the bronchi with an inflammatory component,
    often in response to allergens.\n\nIn asthma, the constriction of the bronchi
    can result in difficulty in breathing giving shortness of breath; this can lead
    to a lack of oxygen reaching the body for cellular processes. \n\nIn this case,
    an inhaler can be used to rectify the problem. \n\nThe inhaler administers a
    bronchodilator, which serves to soothe the constricted bronchi and to re-expand
    the airways. \n\nThis effect occurs quite quickly.\n\n\n=== Bronchial atresia
    ===\n\nBronchial atresia is a rare congenital disorder that can have a varied
    appearance. \n\nA bronchial atresia is a defect in the development of the bronchi,
    affecting one or more bronchi \u2013 usually segmental bronchi and sometimes
    lobar. \n\nThe defect takes the form of a blind-ended bronchus. \n\nThe surrounding
    tissue secretes mucus normally but builds up and becomes distended. \n\nThis
    can lead to regional emphysema.\n\nThe collected mucus may form a mucoid impaction
    or a bronchocele, or both. \n\nA pectus excavatum may accompany a bronchial atresia.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchus"

  descriptionText: "\n\nURETER\n\n\nThe ureters are tubes made of smooth muscle that
    propel urine from the kidneys to the urinary bladder. \n\nIn a human adult, the
    ureters are usually 20\u201330 cm (8\u201312 in) long and around 3\u20134 mm
    (0.12\u20130.16 in) in diameter. \n\nThe ureter is lined by urothelial cells,
    a type of transitional epithelium, and has an additional smooth muscle layer
    that assists with peristalsis in its lowest third.\nThe ureters can be affected
    by a number of diseases, including urinary tract infections and kidney stone.
    \n\nStenosis is when a ureter is narrowed, due to for example chronic inflammation.
    \n\nCongenital abnormalities that affect the ureters can include the development
    of two ureters on the same side or abnormally placed ureters. \n\nAdditionally,
    reflux of urine from the bladder back up the ureters is a condition commonly
    seen in children.\nThe ureters have been identified for at least two thousand
    years, with the word \"ureter\" stemming from the stem uro- relating to urinating
    and seen in written records since at least the time of Hippocrates. \n\nIt is,
    however, only since the 1500s that the term \"ureter\" has been consistently
    used to refer to the modern structure, and only since the development of medical
    imaging in the 1900s that techniques such as X-ray, CT, and ultrasound have been
    able to view the ureters. \n\nThe ureters are also seen from the inside using
    a flexible camera, called ureteroscopy, which was first described in 1964.\n\n\n==
    Structure ==\n\n\nThe ureters are tubular structures, approximately 20\u201330
    cm (7.9\u201311.8 in) in adults, that pass from the pelvis of each kidney into
    the bladder. \n\nFrom the renal pelvis, they descend on top of the psoas major
    muscle to reach the brim of the pelvis. \n\nHere, they cross in front of the
    common iliac arteries. \n\nThey then pass down along the sides of the pelvis
    and finally curve forward and enter the bladder from its left and right sides
    at the back of the bladder. \n\nThe ureters are 1.5\u20136 mm (0.059\u20130.236
    in) in diameter and surrounded by a layer of smooth muscle for 1\u20132 cm (0.39\u20130.79
    in) near their ends just before they enter the bladder.The ureters enter the
    bladder from its back surface, traveling 1.5\u20132 cm (0.59\u20130.79 in) before
    opening into the bladder at an angle on its outer back surface at the slit-like
    ureteric orifices. \n\nThis location is also called the vesicoureteric junction.
    \n\nIn the contracted bladder, they are about 25 mm (1 in) apart and about the
    same distance from the internal urethral orifice; in the distended bladder, these
    measurements may be increased to about 50 mm (2 in).A number of structures pass
    by, above, and around the ureters on their path down from the kidneys to the
    bladder. \n\nIn its upper part, the ureter travels on the psoas major muscle
    and sits just behind the peritoneum. \n\nAs it passes down the muscle, it travels
    over the genitofemoral nerve. \n\nThe inferior vena cava and the abdominal aorta
    sit to the midline of the right and left ureters, respectively. \n\nIn the lower
    part of the abdomen, the right ureter sits behind the lower mesentery and the
    terminal ileum, and the left ureter sits behind the jejunum and the sigmoid colon.
    \n\nAs the ureters enter the pelvis, they are surrounded by connective tissue,
    and travel backward and outward, passing in front of the internal iliac arteries
    and internal iliac veins. \n\nThey then travel inward and forward, crossing the
    umbilical, inferior vesical, and middle rectal arteries. \n\nFrom here, in males,
    they cross under the vas deferens and in front of the seminal vesicles to enter
    the bladder near the trigone. \n\nIn females, the ureters pass behind the ovaries
    and then travel in the lower midline section of the broad ligament of the uterus.
    \n\nFor a short part, the uterine arteries travel on top for a short (2.5 cm
    (0.98 in)) period. \n\nThey then pass by the cervix, traveling inward towards
    the bladder.\n\n\n=== Blood and lymphatic supply ===\n\nThe arteries which supply
    the ureter vary along its course. \n\nThe upper third of the ureter, closest
    to the kidney, is supplied by the renal arteries. \n\nThe middle part of the
    ureter is supplied by the common iliac arteries, direct branches from the abdominal
    aorta, and gonadal arteries; the gonadal arteries being the testicular artery
    in men and the ovarian artery in women. \n\nThe lower third of the ureter, closest
    to the bladder, is supplied by branches from the internal iliac arteries, mainly
    the superior and inferior vesical arteries. \n\nThe arterial supply can be variable,
    with arteries that contribute include the middle rectal artery, branches directly
    from the aorta, and, in women, the uterine and vaginal arteries.The arteries
    that supply the ureters end in a network of vessels within the adventitia of
    the ureters. \n\nThere are many connections (anastamoses) between the arteries
    of the ureter, particularly in the adventitia, which means damage to a single
    vessel does not compromise the blood supply of the ureter. \n\nVenous drainage
    mostly parallels that of the arterial supply; that is, it begins as a network
    of smaller veins in the adventitia; with the renal veins draining the upper ureters,
    and the vesicular and gonadal veins draining the lower ureters.Lymphatic drainage
    depends on the position of lymphatic vessels in the ureter. \n\nLymph collects
    in submucosal, intramuscular and adventitial lymphatic vessels. \n\nThose vessels
    closer to the kidney drain into renal collecting vessels, and from here into
    the lateral aortic nodes near the gonadal vessels. \n\nThe middle part of the
    ureter drains into the right paracaval and interaortocaval nodes on the right,
    and the left paraaortic nodes on the left. \n\nIn the lower ureter, lymph may
    drain into the common iliac lymph nodes, or lower down in the pelvis to the common,
    external, or internal iliac lymph nodes.\n\n\n=== Nerve supply ===\n\nThe ureters
    are richly supplied by nerves that form a network (plexus) of nerves, the ureteric
    plexus that lies in the adventitia of the ureters. \n\nThis plexus is formed
    from a number of nerve roots directly (T9-12, L1, and S2-4), as well as branches
    from other nerve plexuses and nerves; specifically, the upper third of the ureter
    receives nerve branches from the renal plexus and aortic plexus, the middle part
    receives branches from the upper hypogastric plexus and nerve, and the lower
    ureter receives branches from the lower hypogastric plexus and nerve. \n\nThe
    plexus is in the adventitia. \n\nThese nerves travel in individual bundles and
    along small blood vessels to form the ureteric plexus. \n\nSensation supplied
    is sparse close to the kidneys and increases closer to the bladder.Sensation
    to the ureters is provided by nerves that come from T11 - L2 segments of the
    spinal cord. \n\nWhen pain is caused, for example by spasm of the ureters or
    by a stone, the pain may be referred to the dermatomes of T11 - L2, namely the
    back and sides of the abdomen, the scrotum (males) or labia majora (females)
    and upper part of the front of the thigh.\n\n\n=== Microanatomy ===\n\n\nThe
    ureter is lined by urothelium, a type of transitional epithelium that is capable
    of responding to stretches in the ureters. \n\nThe transitional epithelium may
    appear as a layer of column-shaped cells when relaxed, and of flatter cells when
    distended. \n\nBelow the epithelium sits the lamina propria. \n\nThe lamina propria
    is made up of loose connective tissue with many elastic fibers interspersed with
    blood vessels, veins and lymphatics. \n\nThe ureter is surrounded by two muscular
    layers, an inner longitudinal layer of muscle, and an outer circular or spiral
    layer of muscle. \n\nThe lower third of the ureter has a third muscular layer.
    \n\nBeyond these layers sits an adventitia containing blood vessels, lymphatic
    vessels, and veins.\n\n\n=== Development ===\n\n\nThe ureters develop from the
    ureteric buds, which are outpouchings from the mesonephric duct. \n\nThis is
    a duct, derived from mesoderm, found in the early embryo. \n\nOver time, the
    buds elongate, moving into surrounding mesodermal tissue, dilate, and divide
    into left and right ureters. \n\nEventually, successive divisions from these
    buds form not only the ureters, but also the pelvis, major and minor calyces,
    and collecting ducts of the kidneys.The mesonephric duct is connected with the
    cloaca, which over the course of development splits into a urogenital sinus and
    the anorectal canal. \n\nThe urinary bladder forms from the urogenital sinus.
    \n\nOver time, as the bladder enlarges, it absorbs the surrounding parts of the
    primitive ureters. \n\nFinally, the entry points of the ureters into the bladder
    move upwards, owing to the upward migration of the kidneys in the developing
    embryo.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\nThe ureters are a component of the urinary system.
    \n\nUrine, produced by the kidneys, travels along the ureters to the bladder.
    \n\nIt does this through regular contractions called peristalsis.\n\n\n== Clinical
    significance ==\n\n\n\n=== Ureteral stones ===\n\n\nA kidney stone can move from
    the kidney and become lodged inside the ureter, which can block the flow of urine,
    as well as cause a sharp cramp in the back, side, or lower abdomen. \n\nPain
    often comes in waves lasting up to two hours, then subsides, called renal colic.
    \n\nThe affected kidney could then develop hydronephrosis, should a part of the
    kidney become swollen due to blocked flow of urine. \n\nIt is classically described
    that there are three sites in the ureter where a kidney stone will commonly become
    stuck:\nwhere the ureter meets the renal pelvis; where the iliac blood vessels
    cross the ureters; and where the ureters enter the urinary bladder, however a
    retrospective case study, which is a primary source, of where stones lodged based
    on medical imaging did not show many stones at the place where the iliac blood
    vessels cross.Most stones are compounds containing calcium such as calcium oxalate
    and calcium phosphate. \n\nThe first recommended investigation is a CT scan of
    the abdomen because it can detect almost all stones. \n\nManagement includes
    analgesia, often with nonsteroidal antiinflammatories. \n\nSmall stones (< 4mm)
    may pass themselves; larger stones may require lithotripsy, and those with complications
    such as hydronephrosis or infection may require surgery to remove.\n\n\n=== Reflux
    ===\n\nVesicoureteral reflux refers to the reflux of fluid from the bladder into
    the ureters. \n\nThis condition can be associated with urinary tract infections,
    particularly in children, and is present in up to 28\u201336% of children to
    some degree. \n\nA number of forms of medical imaging are available for diagnosis
    of the condition, with modalities including doppler urinary tract ultrasound,
    MAG 3 nuclear medicine scaning, and a micturition urethrocystogram. \n\nFactors
    that affect which of these are selected depends if a child is able to receive
    a urinary catheter, and whether a child is toilet trained. \n\nWhether these
    investigations are performed at the first time a child has an illness, or later
    and depending on other factors (such as if the causal bacteria is E. coli) differ
    between US, EU and UK guidelines.Management is also variable, with differences
    between international guidelines on issues such as whether prophylactic antibiotics
    should be used, and whether surgery is recommended. \n\nOne reason is most instances
    of vesicoureteral reflux improve by themselves. \n\nIf surgery is considered,
    it generally involves reattaching the ureters to a different spot on the bladder,
    and extending the part of the ureter that it is within the wall of the bladder,
    with the most common surgical option being Cohen's cross-trigonal reimplantation.\n\n\n===
    Anatomical and surgical abnormalities ===\n\nBlockage, or obstruction of the
    ureter can occur, as a result of narrowing within the ureter, or compression
    or fibrosis of structures around the ureter. \n\nNarrowing can result of ureteric
    stones, masses associated with cancer, and other lesions such as endometriosis
    tuberculosis and schistosomiasis. \n\nThings outside the ureters such as constipation
    and retroperitoneal fibrosis can also compress them. \n\nSome congenital abnormalities
    can also result in narrowing or the ureters. \n\nCongenital disorders of the
    ureter and urinary tract affect 10% of infants. \n\nThese include partial or
    total duplication of the ureter (a duplex ureter), or the formation of a second
    irregularly placed (ectopic) ureter; or where the junction with the bladder is
    malformed or a ureterocoele develops (usually in that location). \n\nIf the ureters
    have been resited as a result of surgery, for example due to a kidney transplant
    or due to past surgery for vesicoureteric reflux, that site may also become narrowed.A
    narrowed ureter may lead to ureteric enlargement (dilation) and cause swelling
    of the kidneys (hydronephrosis). \n\nAssociated symptoms may include recurrent
    infections, pain or blood in the urine; and when tested, kidney function might
    be seen to decrease. \n\nThese are considered situations when surgery is needed.
    \n\nMedical imaging, including urinary tract ultrasound, CT or nuclear medicine
    imaging is conducted to investigate many causes. \n\nThis may involve reinserting
    the ureters into a new place on the bladder (reimplantion), or widening of the
    ureter. \n\nA ureteric stent may be inserted to relieve an obstruction. \n\nIf
    the cause cannot be removed, a nephrostomy may be required, which is the insertion
    of a tube connected to the renal pelvis which directly drains urine into a stoma
    bag.\n\n\n=== Cancer ===\n\nCancer of the ureters is known as ureteral cancer.
    \n\nIt is usually due to cancer of the urothelium, the cells that line the surface
    of the ureters. \n\nUrothelial cancer is more common after the age of 40, and
    more common in men than women; other risk factors include smoking and exposure
    to dyes such as aromatic amines and aldehydes. \n\nWhen cancer is present, the
    most common symptom in an affected person is blood in the urine; it may not cause
    symptoms, and a physical medical examination may be otherwise normal, except
    in late disease. \n\nUreteral cancer is most often due to cancer of the cells
    lining the ureter, called transitional cell carcinoma, although it can more rarely
    occur as a squamous cell carcinoma if the type of cells lining the urethra have
    changed due to chronic inflammation, such as due to stones or schistosomiasis.Investigations
    performed usually include collecting a sample of urine for an inspection for
    malignant cells under a microscope, called cytology, as well as medical imaging
    by a CT urogram or ultrasound. \n\nIf a concerning lesion is seen, a flexible
    camera may be inserted into the ureters, called ureteroscopy, in order to view
    the lesion and take a biopsy, and a CT scan will be performed of other body parts
    (a CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis) to look for additional metastatic
    lesions. \n\nAfter the cancer is staged, treatment may involve open surgery to
    remove the affected ureter and kidney if it is involved; or, if the lesion is
    small, it may be removed via ureteroscopy. \n\nPrognosis can vary markedly depending
    on the tumour grade, with a worse prognosis associated with an ulcerating lesion.\n\n\n===
    Injury ===\n\nInjuries to the ureter can occur after penetrating abdominal injuries,
    and injuries at high speeds followed by an abrupt stop (such as a high speed
    car accident). \n\nThe ureter can be injured during surgery to nearby structures.
    \n\nIt is injured in 2 per 10,000 cases of vaginal hysterectomies and 13 per
    10,000 cases of abdominal hysterectomies, usually near the suspensory ligament
    of the ovary or near the cardinal ligament, where the ureter runs close to the
    blood vessels of the uterus.\n\n\n=== Imaging ===\n\nSeveral forms of medical
    imaging exist that are used to view the ureters and urinary tract. \n\nUltrasound
    may be able to show evidence of blockage because of hydronephrosis of the kidneys
    and renal pelvis. \n\nCT scans, including ones where contrast media is injected
    intravenously to better show the ureters, and with contrast to better show lesions,
    and to differentiate benign from malignant lesions. \n\nDye may also be injected
    directly into the ureters or renal tract; an antegrade pyelogram is when contrast
    is injected directly into the renal pelvis, and a retrograde pyelogram is where
    dye is injected into the urinary tract via a catheter, and flows backwards into
    the ureters. \n\nMore invasive forms of imaging include ureteroscopy, which is
    the insertion of a flexible endoscope into the urinary tract to view the ureters.
    \n\nUreteroscopy is most commonly used for medium to large-sized stones when
    less invasive methods of removal are not able to be used.\n\n\n== Other animals
    ==\n\nAll vertebrates have two kidneys located behind the abdomen that produce
    urine, and have a way of excreting it, so that waste products within the urine
    can be removed from the body. \n\nThe structure specifically called the ureter
    is present in amniotes, meaning mammals, birds and reptiles. \n\nThese animals
    possess an adult kidney derived from the metanephros. \n\nThe duct that connects
    the kidney to excrete urine in these animals is the ureter. \n\nIt connects to
    the urinary bladder, from whence urine leaves via the urethra.\n\n\n== History
    ==\n\nThe word \"ureter\" comes from the Ancient Greek stem \"uro\" relating
    to urination, and the first use of the word is seen during the era of Hippocrates
    to refer to the urethra. \n\nThe anatomical structure of the ureter was noted
    by 40 AD. \n\nHowever, the terms \"ureter\" and \"urethra\" were variably used
    to refer to each other thereafter for more than a millennium. \n\nIt was only
    in the 1550s that anatomists such as Bartolomeo Eustacchio and Jacques Dubois
    began to use the terms to specifically and consistently refer to what is in modern
    English called the ureter and the urethra. \n\nFollowing this, in the 19th and
    20th centuries multiple terms relating to the structures such as ureteritis and
    ureterography, were coined.Kidney stones have been identified and recorded about
    as long as written historical records exist. \n\nThe urinary tract including
    the ureters, as well as their function to drain urine from the kidneys, has been
    described by Galen in the second century AD.The first to examine the ureter through
    an internal approach, called ureteroscopy, rather than surgery was Hampton Young
    in 1929. \n\nThis was improved on by VF Marshall who is the first published use
    of a flexible endoscope based on fiber optics, which occurred in 1964. \n\nThe
    insertion of a drainage tube into the renal pelvis, bypassing the ureters and
    urinary tract, called nephrostomy, was first described in 1941. \n\nSuch an approach
    differed greatly from the open surgical approaches within the urinary system
    employed during the preceding two millennia.The first radiological imaging of
    the ureters first occurred via X-rays, although this was made more difficult
    by the thick abdomen, which the low power of the original X-rays was not able
    to penetrate enough to produce clear images. \n\nMore useful images were able
    to be produced when Edwin Hurry Fenwick in 1908 pioneered the use of tubes covered
    in radioopaque material visible to X-rays inserted into the ureters, and in the
    early 20th century when contrasts were injected externally into the urinary tract
    (retrograde pyelograms). \n\nUnfortunately, much of the earlier retrograde pyelograms
    were complicated by significant damage to the kidneys as a result of contrast
    based on silver or sodium iodide. \n\nHryntshalk in 1929 pioneered the development
    of the intravenous urogram, in which contrast is injected into a vein and highlights
    the kidney and, when excreted, the urinary tract. \n\nThings improved with the
    development by Moses Swick and Leopold Lichtwitz in the late 1920s of relatively
    nontoxic contrast media, with controversy surrounding publication as to who was
    the primary discoverer. \n\nSide-effects associated with imaging improved even
    more when Tosten Almen published a ground-breaking thesis in 1969 based on the
    less toxic low-osmolar contrast media, developed based on swimming experiences
    in lakes with different salinity.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ureter"

  descriptionText: "\n\nBRONCHUS\n\n\nA bronchus is a passage or airway in the lower
    respiratory tract that conducts air into the lungs. \n\nThe first or primary
    bronchi to branch from the trachea at the carina are the right main bronchus
    and the left main bronchus. \n\nThese are the widest bronchi, and enter the right
    lung, and the left lung at each hilum. \n\nThe main bronchi branch into narrower
    secondary bronchi or lobar bronchi, and these branch into narrower tertiary bronchi
    or segmental bronchi. \n\nFurther divisions of the segmental bronchi are known
    as 4th order, 5th order, and 6th order segmental bronchi, or grouped together
    as subsegmental bronchi.\n\nThe bronchi when too narrow to be supported by cartilage
    are known as bronchioles. \n\nNo gas exchange takes place in the bronchi.\n\n\n==
    Structure ==\n\nThe trachea (windpipe) divides at the carina into two main or
    primary bronchi, the left bronchus and the right bronchus. \n\nThe carina of
    the trachea is located at the level of the sternal angle and the fifth thoracic
    vertebra (at rest).\n\nThe right main bronchus is wider, shorter, and more vertical
    than the left main bronchus, its mean length is 1.09 cm. \n\nIt enters the root
    of the right lung at approximately the fifth thoracic vertebra. \n\nThe right
    main bronchus subdivides into three secondary bronchi (also known as lobar bronchi),
    which deliver oxygen to the three lobes of the right lung\u2014the superior,
    middle and inferior lobe. \n\nThe azygos vein arches over it from behind; and
    the right pulmonary artery lies at first below and then in front of it. \n\nAbout
    2 cm from its commencement it gives off a branch to the superior lobe of the
    right lung, which is also called the eparterial bronchus. \n\nEparterial refers
    to its position above the right pulmonary artery. \n\nThe right bronchus now
    passes below the artery, and is known as the hyparterial branch which divides
    into the two lobar bronchi to the middle and lower lobes.\n\nThe left main bronchus
    is smaller in caliber but longer than the right, being 5 cm long. \n\nIt enters
    the root of the left lung opposite the sixth thoracic vertebra. \n\nIt passes
    beneath the aortic arch, crosses in front of the esophagus, the thoracic duct,
    and the descending aorta, and has the left pulmonary artery lying at first above,
    and then in front of it. \n\nThe left bronchus has no eparterial branch, and
    therefore it has been supposed by some that there is no upper lobe to the left
    lung, but that the so-called upper lobe corresponds to the middle lobe of the
    right lung. \n\nThe left main bronchus divides into two secondary bronchi or
    lobar bronchi, to deliver air to the two lobes of the left lung\u2014the superior
    and the inferior lobe.\n\nThe secondary bronchi divide further into tertiary
    bronchi, (also known as segmental bronchi), each of which supplies a bronchopulmonary
    segment. \n\nA bronchopulmonary segment is a division of a lung separated from
    the rest of the lung by a septum of connective tissue. \n\nThis property allows
    a bronchopulmonary segment to be surgically removed without affecting other segments.
    \n\nInitially, there are ten segments in each lung, but during development with
    the left lung having just two lobes, two pairs of segments fuse to give eight,
    four for each lobe. \n\nThe tertiary bronchi divide further in another three
    branchings known as 4th order, 5th order and 6th order segmental bronchi which
    are also referred to as subsegmental bronchi. \n\nThese branch into many smaller
    bronchioles which divide into terminal bronchioles, each of which then gives
    rise to several respiratory bronchioles, which go on to divide into two to eleven
    alveolar ducts. \n\nThere are five or six alveolar sacs associated with each
    alveolar duct. \n\nThe alveolus is the basic anatomical unit of gas exchange
    in the lung.\nThe main bronchi have relatively large lumens that are lined by
    respiratory epithelium. \n\nThis cellular lining has cilia departing towards
    the mouth which removes dust and other small particles. \n\nThere is a smooth
    muscle layer below the epithelium arranged as two ribbons of muscle that spiral
    in opposite directions. \n\nThis smooth muscle layer contains seromucous glands,
    which secrete mucus, in its wall. \n\nHyaline cartilage is present in the bronchi,
    surrounding the smooth muscle layer. \n\nIn the main bronchi, the cartilage forms
    C-shaped rings like those in the trachea, while in the smaller bronchi, hyaline
    cartilage is present in irregularly arranged crescent-shaped plates and islands.
    \n\nThese plates give structural support to the bronchi and keep the airway open.The
    bronchial wall normally has a thickness of 10% to 20% of the total bronchial
    diameter.\n\n\n=== Microanatomy ===\n\n\nThe cartilage and mucous membrane of
    the main bronchus (primary bronchi) are similar to those in the trachea. \n\nThey
    are lined with respiratory epithelium, which is classified as ciliated pseudostratified
    columnar epithelium. \n\nThe epithelium in the main bronchi contains goblet cells,
    which are glandular, modified simple columnar epithelial cells that produce mucins,
    the main component of mucus. \n\nMucus plays an important role in keeping the
    airways clear in the mucociliary clearance process. \n\nAs branching continues
    through the bronchial tree, the amount of hyaline cartilage in the walls decreases
    until it is absent in the bronchioles. \n\nAs the cartilage decreases, the amount
    of smooth muscle increases. \n\nThe mucous membrane also undergoes a transition
    from ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium, to simple cuboidal epithelium,
    to simple squamous epithelium in the alveolar ducts and alveoli.\n\n\n=== Variation
    ===\n\nIn 0.1 to 5% of people there is a right superior lobe bronchus arising
    from the main stem bronchus prior to the carina. \n\nThis is known as a tracheal
    bronchus, and seen as an anatomical variation. \n\nIt can have multiple variations
    and, although usually asymptomatic, it can be the root cause of pulmonary disease
    such as a recurrent infection. \n\nIn such cases resection is often curative.\n\nThe
    cardiac bronchus has a prevalence of \u22480.3% and presents as an accessory
    bronchus arising from the bronchus intermedius between the upper lobar bronchus
    and the origin of the middle and lower lobar bronchi of the right main bronchus.\n\nAn
    accessory cardiac bronchus is usually an asymptomatic condition but may be associated
    with persistent infection or hemoptysis. \n\nIn about half of observed cases
    the cardiac bronchus presents as a short dead-ending bronchial stump, in the
    remainder the bronchus may exhibit branching and associated aerated lung parenchyma.\n\n\n==
    Function ==\n\n\nThe bronchi function to carry air that is breathed in through
    to the functional tissues of the lungs, called alveoli. \n\nExchange of gases
    between the air in the lungs and the blood in the capillaries occurs across the
    walls of the alveolar ducts and alveoli. \n\nThe alveolar ducts and alveoli consist
    primarily of simple squamous epithelium, which permits rapid diffusion of oxygen
    and carbon dioxide.\n\n\n== Clinical significance ==\n\n\nBronchial wall thickening,
    as can be seen on CT scan, generally (but not always) implies inflammation of
    the bronchi (bronchitis). \n\nNormally, the ratio of the bronchial wall thickness
    and the bronchial diameter is between 0.17 and 0.23.\n\n\n=== Bronchitis ===\n\n\nBronchitis
    is defined as inflammation of the bronchi, which can either be acute or chronic.
    \n\nAcute bronchitis is usually caused by viral or bacterial infections. \n\nMany
    sufferers of chronic bronchitis also suffer from chronic obstructive pulmonary
    disease (COPD), and this is usually associated with smoking or long-term exposure
    to irritants.\n\n\n=== Aspiration ===\n\nThe left main bronchus departs from
    the trachea at a greater angle than that of the right main bronchus. \n\nThe
    right bronchus is also wider than the left and these differences predispose the
    right lung to aspirational problems. \n\nIf food, liquids, or foreign bodies
    are aspirated, they will tend to lodge in the right main bronchus. \n\nBacterial
    pneumonia and aspiration pneumonia may result.\n\nIf a tracheal tube used for
    intubation is inserted too far, it will usually lodge in the right bronchus,
    allowing ventilation only of the right lung.\n\n\n=== Asthma ===\n\nAsthma is
    marked by hyperresponsiveness of the bronchi with an inflammatory component,
    often in response to allergens.\n\nIn asthma, the constriction of the bronchi
    can result in difficulty in breathing giving shortness of breath; this can lead
    to a lack of oxygen reaching the body for cellular processes. \n\nIn this case,
    an inhaler can be used to rectify the problem. \n\nThe inhaler administers a
    bronchodilator, which serves to soothe the constricted bronchi and to re-expand
    the airways. \n\nThis effect occurs quite quickly.\n\n\n=== Bronchial atresia
    ===\n\nBronchial atresia is a rare congenital disorder that can have a varied
    appearance. \n\nA bronchial atresia is a defect in the development of the bronchi,
    affecting one or more bronchi \u2013 usually segmental bronchi and sometimes
    lobar. \n\nThe defect takes the form of a blind-ended bronchus. \n\nThe surrounding
    tissue secretes mucus normally but builds up and becomes distended. \n\nThis
    can lead to regional emphysema.\n\nThe collected mucus may form a mucoid impaction
    or a bronchocele, or both. \n\nA pectus excavatum may accompany a bronchial atresia.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchus"

  descriptionText: "\n\nDESCENDING COLON/\nLARGE INTESTINE\n\n\nThe large intestine,
    also known as the large bowel, is the last part of the gastrointestinal tract
    and of the digestive system in vertebrates. \n\nWater is absorbed here and the
    remaining waste material is stored as feces before being removed by defecation.\n\nThe
    colon is the largest portion of the large intestine, so many mentions of the
    large intestine and colon overlap in meaning whenever precision is not the focus.
    \n\nMost sources define the large intestine as the combination of the cecum,
    colon, rectum, and anal canal. \n\nSome other sources exclude the anal canal.In
    humans, the large intestine begins in the right iliac region of the pelvis, just
    at or below the waist, where it is joined to the end of the small intestine at
    the cecum, via the ileocecal valve. \n\nIt then continues as the colon ascending
    the abdomen, across the width of the abdominal cavity as the transverse colon,
    and then descending to the rectum and its endpoint at the anal canal. \n\nOverall,
    in humans, the large intestine is about 1.5 metres (5 ft) long, which is about
    one-fifth of the whole length of the gastrointestinal tract.\n\n\n== Structure
    ==\n\nThe colon is the last part of the digestive system. \n\nIt has a segmented
    appearance due to a series of saccules called haustra. \n\nIt extracts water
    and salt from solid wastes before they are eliminated from the body and is the
    site in which flora-aided (largely bacterial) fermentation of unabsorbed material
    occurs. \n\nUnlike the small intestine, the colon does not play a major role
    in absorption of foods and nutrients. \n\nAbout 1.5 litres or 45 ounces of water
    arrives in the colon each day.\n\nThe length of the average adult human colon
    is 65 inches or 166 cm (range of 80 to 313 cm) for males, and 61 inches or 155
    cm (range of 80 to 214 cm) for females.\n\n\n=== Sections ===\n\n\nIn mammals,
    the colon consists of six sections: the cecum, the ascending colon, the transverse
    colon, the descending colon, the sigmoid colon, and the rectum.Sections of the
    colon are:\n\n-The cecum including the appendix\n-The ascending colon\n-The transverse
    colon including the colic flexures and transverse mesocolon\n-The descending
    colon\n-The sigmoid colon \u2013 the s-shaped region of the large intestine\n-The
    rectum\n\nThe parts of the colon are either intraperitoneal or behind it in the
    retroperitoneum. \n\nRetroperitoneal organs, in general, do not have a complete
    covering of peritoneum, so they are fixed in location. \n\nIntraperitoneal organs
    are completely surrounded by peritoneum and are therefore mobile. \n\nOf the
    colon, the ascending colon, descending colon and rectum are retroperitoneal,
    while the cecum, appendix, transverse colon and sigmoid colon are intraperitoneal.
    \n\nThis is important as it affects which organs can be easily accessed during
    surgery, such as a laparotomy.\n\nIn terms of diameter, the cecum is the widest,
    averaging slightly less than 9 cm in healthy individuals, and the transverse
    colon averages less than 6 cm in diameter. \n\nThe descending and sigmoid colon
    are slightly smaller, with the sigmoid colon averaging 4\u20135 cm (1.6\u20132.0
    in) in diameter. \n\nDiameters larger than certain thresholds for each colonic
    section can be diagnostic for megacolon.\n\n\n==== Cecum and appendix ====\n\nThe
    cecum is the first section of the colon and involved in the digestion, while
    the appendix which develops embryologically from it, is a structure of the colon,
    not involved in digestion and considered to be part of the gut-associated lymphoid
    tissue. \n\nThe function of the appendix is uncertain, but some sources believe
    that the appendix has a role in housing a sample of the colon's microflora, and
    is able to help to repopulate the colon with bacteria if the microflora has been
    damaged during the course of an immune reaction. \n\nThe appendix has also been
    shown to have a high concentration of lymphatic cells.\n\n\n==== Ascending colon
    ====\n\nThe ascending colon is the first of four main sections of the large intestine.
    \n\nIt is connected to the small intestine by a section of bowel called the cecum.
    \n\nThe ascending colon runs upwards through the abdominal cavity toward the
    transverse colon for approximately eight inches (20 cm).\n\nOne of the main functions
    of the colon is to remove the water and other key nutrients from waste material
    and recycle it. \n\nAs the waste material exits the small intestine through the
    ileocecal valve, it will move into the cecum and then to the ascending colon
    where this process of extraction starts. \n\nThe waste material is pumped upwards
    toward the transverse colon by peristalsis. \n\nThe ascending colon is sometimes
    attached to the appendix via Gerlach's valve. \n\nIn ruminants, the ascending
    colon is known as the spiral colon.\nTaking into account all ages and sexes,
    colon cancer occurs here most often (41%).\n\n\n==== Transverse colon ====\n\nThe
    transverse colon is the part of the colon from the hepatic flexure, also known
    as the right colic, (the turn of the colon by the liver) to the splenic flexure
    also known as the left colic, (the turn of the colon by the spleen). \n\nThe
    transverse colon hangs off the stomach, attached to it by a large fold of peritoneum
    called the greater omentum. \n\nOn the posterior side, the transverse colon is
    connected to the posterior abdominal wall by a mesentery known as the transverse
    mesocolon.\n\nThe transverse colon is encased in peritoneum, and is therefore
    mobile (unlike the parts of the colon immediately before and after it).\n\nThe
    proximal two-thirds of the transverse colon is perfused by the middle colic artery,
    a branch of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA), while the latter third is supplied
    by branches of the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA). \n\nThe \"watershed\" area
    between these two blood supplies, which represents the embryologic division between
    the midgut and hindgut, is an area sensitive to ischemia.\n\n\n==== Descending
    colon ====\n\nThe descending colon is the part of the colon from the splenic
    flexure to the beginning of the sigmoid colon. \n\nOne function of the descending
    colon in the digestive system is to store feces that will be emptied into the
    rectum. \n\nIt is retroperitoneal in two-thirds of humans. \n\nIn the other third,
    it has a (usually short) mesentery. \n\nThe arterial supply comes via the left
    colic artery. \n\nThe descending colon is also called the distal gut, as it is
    further along the gastrointestinal tract than the proximal gut. \n\nGut flora
    are very dense in this region.\n\n\n==== Sigmoid colon ====\n\nThe sigmoid colon
    is the part of the large intestine after the descending colon and before the
    rectum. \n\nThe name sigmoid means S-shaped (see sigmoid; cf. sigmoid sinus).
    \n\nThe walls of the sigmoid colon are muscular and contract to increase the
    pressure inside the colon, causing the stool to move into the rectum.\n\nThe
    sigmoid colon is supplied with blood from several branches (usually between 2
    and 6) of the sigmoid arteries, a branch of the IMA. \n\nThe IMA terminates as
    the superior rectal artery.\nSigmoidoscopy is a common diagnostic technique used
    to examine the sigmoid colon.\n\n\n==== Rectum ====\n\nThe rectum is the last
    section of the large intestine. \n\nIt holds the formed feces awaiting elimination
    via defecation.\nIt is about 12 cm long.\n\n\n=== Appearance ===\n\nThe cecum
    \u2013 the first part of the large intestine\nTaeniae coli \u2013 three bands
    of smooth muscle\nHaustra \u2013 bulges caused by contraction of taeniae coli\nEpiploic
    appendages \u2013 small fat accumulations on the visceraThe taenia coli run the
    length of the large intestine. \n\nBecause the taenia coli are shorter than the
    large bowel itself, the colon becomes sacculated, forming the haustra of the
    colon which are the shelf-like intraluminal projections.\n\n\n=== Blood supply
    ===\n\nArterial supply to the colon comes from branches of the superior mesenteric
    artery (SMA) and inferior mesenteric artery (IMA). \n\nFlow between these two
    systems communicates via the marginal artery of the colon that runs parallel
    to the colon for its entire length. \n\nHistorically, a structure variously identified
    as the arc of Riolan or meandering mesenteric artery (of Moskowitz) was thought
    to connect the proximal SMA to the proximal IMA. \n\nThis variably present structure
    would be important if either vessel were occluded. \n\nHowever, at least one
    review of the literature questions the existence of this vessel, with some experts
    calling for the abolition of these terms from future medical literature.Venous
    drainage usually mirrors colonic arterial supply, with the inferior mesenteric
    vein draining into the splenic vein, and the superior mesenteric vein joining
    the splenic vein to form the hepatic portal vein that then enters the liver.\n\n\n===
    Lymphatic drainage ===\n\nLymphatic drainage from the ascending colon and proximal
    two-thirds of the transverse colon is to the colic lymph nodes and the superior
    mesenteric lymph nodes, which drain into the cisterna chyli. \n\nThe lymph from
    the distal one-third of the transverse colon, the descending colon, the sigmoid
    colon, and the upper rectum drain into the inferior mesenteric and colic lymph
    nodes. \n\nThe lower rectum to the anal canal above the pectinate line drain
    to the internal iliac nodes. \n\nThe anal canal below the pectinate line drains
    into the superficial inguinal nodes. \n\nThe pectinate line only roughly marks
    this transition.\n\n\n=== Nerve supply ===\n\nSympathetic supply : Superior &
    inferior mesenteric ganglia\nParasympathetic supply : Vagus & pelvic nerves\n\n\n===
    Development ===\n\n\n=== Variation ===\n\nOne variation on the normal anatomy
    of the colon occurs when extra loops form, resulting in a colon that is up to
    five metres longer than normal. \n\nThis condition, referred to as redundant
    colon, typically has no direct major health consequences, though rarely volvulus
    occurs, resulting in obstruction and requiring immediate medical attention. \n\nA
    significant indirect health consequence is that use of a standard adult colonoscope
    is difficult and in some cases impossible when a redundant colon is present,
    though specialized variants on the instrument (including the pediatric variant)
    are useful in overcoming this problem.\n\n\n== Microanatomy ==\n\n\n=== Colonic
    crypts ===\n\n\nThe wall of the large intestine is lined with simple columnar
    epithelium with invaginations. \n\nThe invaginations are called the intestinal
    glands or colonic crypts.\n\nThe colon crypts are shaped like microscopic thick
    walled test tubes with a central hole down the length of the tube (the crypt
    lumen). \n\nFour tissue sections are shown here, two cut across the long axes
    of the crypts and two cut parallel to the long axes. \n\nIn these images the
    cells have been stained by immunohistochemistry to show a brown-orange color
    if the cells produce a mitochondrial protein called cytochrome c oxidase subunit
    I (CCOI). \n\nThe nuclei of the cells (located at the outer edges of the cells
    lining the walls of the crypts) are stained blue-gray with haematoxylin. \n\nAs
    seen in panels C and D, crypts are about 75 to about 110 cells long. \n\nBaker
    et al. found that the average crypt circumference is 23 cells. \n\nThus, by the
    images shown here, there are an average of about 1,725 to 2,530 cells per colonic
    crypt. \n\nNooteboom et al. measuring the number of cells in a small number of
    crypts reported a range of 1,500 to 4,900 cells per colonic crypt. \n\nCells
    are produced at the crypt base and migrate upward along the crypt axis before
    being shed into the colonic lumen days later. \n\nThere are 5 to 6 stem cells
    at the bases of the crypts.\n\nAs estimated from the image in panel A, there
    are about 100 colonic crypts per square millimeter of the colonic epithelium.
    \n\nSince the average length of the human colon is 160.5 cm and the average inner
    circumference of the colon is 6.2 cm, the inner surface epithelial area of the
    human colon has an average area of about 995 cm2, which includes 9,950,000 (close
    to 10 million) crypts.\n\nIn the four tissue sections shown here, many of the
    intestinal glands have cells with a mitochondrial DNA mutation in the CCOI gene
    and appear mostly white, with their main color being the blue-gray staining of
    the nuclei. \n\nAs seen in panel B, a portion of the stem cells of three crypts
    appear to have a mutation in CCOI, so that 40% to 50% of the cells arising from
    those stem cells form a white segment in the cross cut area.\n\nOverall, the
    percent of crypts deficient for CCOI is less than 1% before age 40, but then
    increases linearly with age. \n\nColonic crypts deficient for CCOI in women reaches,
    on average, 18% in women and 23% in men by 80\u201384 years of age.Crypts of
    the colon can reproduce by fission, as seen in panel C, where a crypt is fissioning
    to form two crypts, and in panel B where at least one crypt appears to be fissioning.
    \n\nMost crypts deficient in CCOI are in clusters of crypts (clones of crypts)
    with two or more CCOI-deficient crypts adjacent to each other (see panel D).\n\n\n====
    Mucosa ====\n\nAbout 150 of the many thousands of protein coding genes expressed
    in the large intestine, some are specific to the mucous membrane in different
    regions and include CEACAM7.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\n\nThe large intestine absorbs
    water and any remaining absorbable nutrients from the food before sending the
    indigestible matter to the rectum. \n\nThe colon absorbs vitamins that are created
    by the colonic bacteria, such as thiamine, riboflavin, and vitamin K (especially
    important as the daily ingestion of vitamin K is not normally enough to maintain
    adequate blood coagulation). \n\nIt also compacts feces, and stores fecal matter
    in the rectum until it can be discharged via the anus in defecation.\n\nThe large
    intestine also secretes K+ and Cl-. \n\nChloride secretion increases in cystic
    fibrosis.\nRecycling of various nutrients takes place in colon. \n\nExamples
    include fermentation of carbohydrates, short chain fatty acids, and urea cycling.\n\nThe
    appendix contains a small amount of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue which gives
    the appendix an undetermined role in immunity. \n\nHowever, the appendix is known
    to be important in fetal life as it contains endocrine cells that release biogenic
    amines and peptide hormones important for homeostasis during early growth and
    development. \n\nThe appendix can be removed with no apparent damage or consequence
    to the patient.By the time the chyme has reached this tube, most nutrients and
    90% of the water have been absorbed by the body. \n\nAt this point some electrolytes
    like sodium, magnesium, and chloride are left as well as indigestible parts of
    ingested food (e.g., a large part of ingested amylose, starch which has been
    shielded from digestion heretofore, and dietary fiber, which is largely indigestible
    carbohydrate in either soluble or insoluble form). \n\nAs the chyme moves through
    the large intestine, most of the remaining water is removed, while the chyme
    is mixed with mucus and bacteria (known as gut flora), and becomes feces. \n\nThe
    ascending colon receives fecal material as a liquid. \n\nThe muscles of the colon
    then move the watery waste material forward and slowly absorb all the excess
    water, causing the stools to gradually solidify as they move along into the descending
    colon.\n\nThe bacteria break down some of the fiber for their own nourishment
    and create acetate, propionate, and butyrate as waste products, which in turn
    are used by the cell lining of the colon for nourishment. \n\nNo protein is made
    available. \n\nIn humans, perhaps 10% of the undigested carbohydrate thus becomes
    available, though this may vary with diet; in other animals, including other
    apes and primates, who have proportionally larger colons, more is made available,
    thus permitting a higher portion of plant material in the diet. \n\nThe large
    intestine produces no digestive enzymes \u2014 chemical digestion is completed
    in the small intestine before the chyme reaches the large intestine. \n\nThe
    pH in the colon varies between 5.5 and 7 (slightly acidic to neutral).\n\n\n===
    Standing gradient osmosis ===\n\nWater absorption at the colon typically proceeds
    against a transmucosal osmotic pressure gradient. \n\nThe standing gradient osmosis
    is the reabsorption of water against the osmotic gradient in the intestines.
    \n\nCells occupying the intestinal lining pump sodium ions into the intercellular
    space, raising the osmolarity of the intercellular fluid. \n\nThis hypertonic
    fluid creates an osmotic pressure that drives water into the lateral intercellular
    spaces by osmosis via tight junctions and adjacent cells, which then in turn
    moves across the basement membrane and into the capillaries, while more sodium
    ions are pumped again into the intercellular fluid. \n\nAlthough water travels
    down an osmotic gradient in each individual step, overall, water usually travels
    against the osmotic gradient due to the pumping of sodium ions into the intercellular
    fluid. \n\nThis allows the large intestine to absorb water despite the blood
    in capillaries being hypotonic compared to the fluid within the intestinal lumen.\n\n\n===
    Gut flora ===\n\nThe large intestine houses over 700 species of bacteria that
    perform a variety of functions, as well as fungi, protozoa, and archaea. \n\nSpecies
    diversity varies by geography and diet. \n\nThe microbes in a human distal gut
    often number in the vicinity of 100 trillion, and can weigh around 200 grams
    (0.44 pounds). \n\nThis mass of mostly symbiotic microbes has recently been called
    the latest human organ to be \"discovered\" or in other words, the \"forgotten
    organ\".The large intestine absorbs some of the products formed by the bacteria
    inhabiting this region. \n\nUndigested polysaccharides (fiber) are metabolized
    to short-chain fatty acids by bacteria in the large intestine and absorbed by
    passive diffusion. \n\nThe bicarbonate that the large intestine secretes helps
    to neutralize the increased acidity resulting from the formation of these fatty
    acids.\n\nThese bacteria also produce large amounts of vitamins, especially vitamin
    K and biotin (a B vitamin), for absorption into the blood. \n\nAlthough this
    source of vitamins, in general, provides only a small part of the daily requirement,
    it makes a significant contribution when dietary vitamin intake is low. \n\nAn
    individual who depends on absorption of vitamins formed by bacteria in the large
    intestine may become vitamin-deficient if treated with antibiotics that inhibit
    the vitamin producing species of bacteria as well as the intended disease-causing
    bacteria.\n\nOther bacterial products include gas (flatus), which is a mixture
    of nitrogen and carbon dioxide, with small amounts of the gases hydrogen, methane,
    and hydrogen sulfide. \n\nBacterial fermentation of undigested polysaccharides
    produces these. \n\nSome of the fecal odor is due to indoles, metabolized from
    the amino acid tryptophan. \n\nThe normal flora is also essential in the development
    of certain tissues, including the cecum and lymphatics.\n\nThey are also involved
    in the production of cross-reactive antibodies. \n\nThese are antibodies produced
    by the immune system against the normal flora, that are also effective against
    related pathogens, thereby preventing infection or invasion.\n\nThe two most
    prevalent phyla of the colon are firmicutes and bacteroidetes. \n\nThe ratio
    between the two seems to vary widely as reported by the Human Microbiome Project.
    \n\nBacteroides are implicated in the initiation of colitis and colon cancer.
    \n\nBifidobacteria are also abundant, and are often described as 'friendly bacteria'.A
    mucus layer protects the large intestine from attacks from colonic commensal
    bacteria.\n\n\n== Clinical significance ==\n\n\n=== Disease ===\n\nFollowing
    are the most common diseases or disorders of the colon:\n\n\n=== Colonoscopy
    ===\n\nColonoscopy is the endoscopic examination of the large intestine and the
    distal part of the small bowel with a CCD camera or a fiber optic camera on a
    flexible tube passed through the anus. \n\nIt can provide a visual diagnosis
    (e.g. ulceration, polyps) and grants the opportunity for biopsy or removal of
    suspected colorectal cancer lesions. \n\nColonoscopy can remove polyps as small
    as one millimetre or less. \n\nOnce polyps are removed, they can be studied with
    the aid of a microscope to determine if they are precancerous or not. \n\nIt
    takes 15 years or less for a polyp to turn cancerous.\nColonoscopy is similar
    to sigmoidoscopy\u2014the difference being related to which parts of the colon
    each can examine. \n\nA colonoscopy allows an examination of the entire colon
    (1200\u20131500 mm in length). \n\nA sigmoidoscopy allows an examination of the
    distal portion (about 600 mm) of the colon, which may be sufficient because benefits
    to cancer survival of colonoscopy have been limited to the detection of lesions
    in the distal portion of the colon.\n\nA sigmoidoscopy is often used as a screening
    procedure for a full colonoscopy, often done in conjunction with a stool-based
    test such as a fecal occult blood test (FOBT), fecal immunochemical test (FIT),
    or multi-target stool DNA test (Cologuard) or blood-based test, SEPT9 DNA methylation
    test (Epi proColon). \n\nAbout 5% of these screened patients are referred to
    colonoscopy.\n\nVirtual colonoscopy, which uses 2D and 3D imagery reconstructed
    from computed tomography (CT) scans or from nuclear magnetic resonance (MR) scans,
    is also possible, as a totally non-invasive medical test, although it is not
    standard and still under investigation regarding its diagnostic abilities. \n\nFurthermore,
    virtual colonoscopy does not allow for therapeutic maneuvers such as polyp/tumour
    removal or biopsy nor visualization of lesions smaller than 5 millimeters. \n\nIf
    a growth or polyp is detected using CT colonography, a standard colonoscopy would
    still need to be performed. \n\nAdditionally, surgeons have lately been using
    the term pouchoscopy to refer to a colonoscopy of the ileo-anal pouch.\n\n\n==
    Other animals ==\n\nThe large intestine is truly distinct only in tetrapods,
    in which it is almost always separated from the small intestine by an ileocaecal
    valve. \n\nIn most vertebrates, however, it is a relatively short structure running
    directly to the anus, although noticeably wider than the small intestine. \n\nAlthough
    the caecum is present in most amniotes, only in mammals does the remainder of
    the large intestine develop into a true colon.\n\nIn some small mammals, the
    colon is straight, as it is in other tetrapods, but, in the majority of mammalian
    species, it is divided into ascending and descending portions; a distinct transverse
    colon is typically present only in primates. \n\nHowever, the taeniae coli and
    accompanying haustra are not found in either carnivorans or ruminants. \n\nThe
    rectum of mammals (other than monotremes) is derived from the cloaca of other
    vertebrates, and is, therefore, not truly homologous with the \"rectum\" found
    in these species.\n\nIn fish, there is no true large intestine, but simply a
    short rectum connecting the end of the digestive part of the gut to the cloaca.
    \n\nIn sharks, this includes a rectal gland that secretes salt to help the animal
    maintain osmotic balance with the seawater. \n\nThe gland somewhat resembles
    a caecum in structure but is not a homologous structure.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_intestine"

  descriptionText: "\n\nEPIDIDYMIS\n\n\nThe epididymis (; plural: epididymides or
    ) is a tube that connects a testicle to a vas deferens in the male reproductive
    system. \n\nIt is present in all male reptiles, birds, and mammals. \n\nIt is
    a single, narrow, tightly-coiled tube in adult humans, 6 to 7 meters (20 to 23
    ft) in length connecting the efferent ducts from the rear of each testicle to
    its vas deferens.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe epididymis can be divided into
    three main regions:\n\nThe head (Latin: caput). \n\nThe head of the epididymis
    receives spermatozoa via the efferent ducts of the mediastinium of the testis.
    \n\nIt is characterized histologically by a thick epithelium with long stereocilia
    (described below) and a little smooth muscle. \n\nIt is involved in absorbing
    fluid to make the sperm more concentrated. \n\nThe concentration of the sperm
    here is dilute.\nThe body (Latin: corpus). \n\nThis has an intermediate epithelium
    and smooth muscle thickness.\nThe tail (Latin: cauda). \n\nThis has the thinnest
    epithelium of the three regions and the greatest quantity of smooth muscle.In
    reptiles, there is an additional canal between the testis and the head of the
    epididymis and which receives the various efferent ducts. \n\nThis is, however,
    absent in all birds and mammals.\n\n\n=== Histology ===\n\nThe epididymis is
    covered by a two layered pseudostratified epithelium. \n\nThe epithelium is separated
    by a basement membrane from the connective tissue wall which has smooth muscle
    cells. \n\nThe major cell types in the epithelium are:\n\nPrincipal cells: columnar
    cells that, with the basal cells, form the majority of the epithelium. \n\nIn
    the caput (head) region these cells have long stereocilia that are tuft-like
    extensions that project into the lumen. \n\nThe sterocilia are much shorter in
    the cauda (tail) segment. \n\nThey also secrete carnitine, sialic acid, glycoproteins,
    and glycerylphosphorylcholine into the lumen.\nBasal cells: shorter, pyramid-shaped
    cells which contact the basal lamina but taper off before their apical surfaces
    reach the lumen. \n\nThese are thought to be undifferentiated precursors of principal
    cells.\nApical cells: predominantly found in the head region\nClear cells: predominant
    in the tail region\nIntraepithelial lymphocytes: distributed throughout the tissue.\nIntraepithelial
    macrophages\n\n\n==== Stereocilia ====\nThe stereocilia of the epididymis are
    long cytoplasmic projections that have an actin filament backbone. \n\nThese
    filaments have been visualized at high resolution using fluorescent phalloidin
    that binds to actin filaments.\nThe stereocilia in the epididymis are non-motile.
    \n\nThese membrane extensions increase the surface area of the cell, allowing
    for greater absorption and secretion. \n\nIt has been shown that epithelial sodium
    channel ENaC that allows the flow of Na+ ions into the cell is localized on stereocilia.Because
    sperm are initially non-motile as they leave the seminiferous tubules, large
    volumes of fluid are secreted to propel them to the epididymis. \n\nThe core
    function of the stereocilia is to resorb 90% of this fluid as the spermatozoa
    start to become motile. \n\nThis absorption creates a fluid current that moves
    the immobile sperm from the seminiferous tubules to the epididymis. \n\nSpermatozoa
    do not reach full motility until they reach the vagina, where the alkaline pH
    is neutralized by acidic vaginal fluids.\n\n\n=== Development ===\n\nIn the embryo,
    the epididymis develops from tissue that once formed the mesonephros, a primitive
    kidney found in many aquatic vertebrates. \n\nPersistence of the cranial end
    of the mesonephric duct will leave behind a remnant called the appendix of the
    epididymis. \n\nIn addition, some mesonephric tubules can persist as the paradidymis,
    a small body caudal to the efferent ductules.\nA Gartner's duct is a homologous
    remnant in the female.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\n\n\n=== Role in storage of sperm
    and ejaculant ===\n\nSpermatozoa formed in the testis enter the caput epididymis,
    progress to the corpus, and finally reach the cauda region, where they are stored.
    \n\nSperm entering the caput epididymis are incomplete\u2014they lack the ability
    to swim forward (motility) and to fertilize an egg. \n\nEpididymal transit takes
    2 to 6 days in humans and 10\u201313 in rodents. \n\nDuring their transit in
    the epididymis, sperm undergo maturation processes necessary for them to acquire
    motility and fertility. \n\nFinal maturation (capacitation) is completed in the
    female reproductive tract.\nThe epididymis secretes immobilin, a large glycoprotein
    that is responsible for the creating of the viscoelastic luminal environment
    that serves to mechanically immobilize spermatozoa until ejaculation. \n\nImmobilin
    is predominantly secreted into the proximal caput epididymis prior to the acquisition
    of the potential for sperm motility. \n\nDuring ejaculation, sperm flow from
    the cauda epididymis (which functions as a storage reservoir) into the vas deferens
    where they are propelled by the peristaltic action of muscle layers in the wall
    of the vas deferens, and are mixed with the diluting fluids of the prostate,
    seminal vesicles, and other accessory glands prior to ejaculation (forming semen).\n\n\n==
    Clinical significance ==\n\n\n\n=== Inflammation ===\n\nAn inflammation of the
    epididymis is called epididymitis. \n\nIt is much more common than testicular
    inflammation, termed orchitis.\n\n\n=== Surgical removal ===\n\nEpididymotomy
    is the placing of an incision into the epididymis and is sometimes considered
    as a treatment option for acute suppurating epididymitis.\nEpididymectomy is
    the surgical removal of the epididymis sometimes performed for post-vasectomy
    pain syndrome and for refractory cases of epididymitis.\nEpididymectomy is also
    performed for sterilization on some male animals of livestock species so they
    can be used to detect estrus in females ready for artificially insemination.\n\n\n==

  descriptionText: "\n\nGREATER OMENTUM\n\n\nThe greater omentum (also the great
    omentum, omentum majus, gastrocolic omentum, epiploon, or, especially in animals,
    caul) is a large apron-like fold of visceral peritoneum that hangs down from
    the stomach. \n\nIt extends from the greater curvature of the stomach, passing
    in front of the small intestines and doubles back to ascend to the transverse
    colon before reaching to the posterior abdominal wall. \n\nThe greater omentum
    is larger than the lesser omentum, which hangs down from the liver to the lesser
    curvature. \n\nThe common anatomical term \"epiploic\" derives from \"epiploon\",
    from the Greek epipleein, meaning to float or sail on, since the greater omentum
    appears to float on the surface of the intestines. \n\nIt is the first structure
    observed when the abdominal cavity is opened anteriorly (from the front).\n\n\n==
    Structure ==\n\n\nThe greater omentum is the larger of the two peritoneal folds.
    \n\nIt consists of a double sheet of peritoneum, folded on itself so that it
    has four layers.The two layers of the greater omentum descend from the greater
    curvature of the stomach and the beginning of the duodenum. \n\nThey pass in
    front of the small intestines, sometimes as low as the pelvis, before turning
    on themselves, and ascending as far as the transverse colon, where they separate
    and enclose that part of the intestine.These individual layers are easily seen
    in the young, but in the adult they are more or less inseparably blended.\nThe
    left border of the greater omentum is continuous with the gastrosplenic ligament;
    its right border extends as far as the beginning of the duodenum.\nThe greater
    omentum is usually thin, and has a perforated appearance. \n\nIt contains some
    adipose tissue, which can accumulate considerably in obese people. \n\nIt is
    highly vascularised.\n\n\n=== Subdivisions ===\n\n\nThe greater omentum is often
    defined to encompass a variety of structures. \n\nMost sources include the following
    three:\nGastrophrenic ligament\u2014extends to the underside of the left dome
    of the diaphragm\nGastrocolic ligament\u2014extends to the transverse colon (occasionally
    on its own considered synonymous with \"greater omentum\")\nGastrosplenic ligament
    (or Gastrolienal) ligament)\u2014 extends to the spleen, overlying the kidneyThe
    splenorenal ligament (or lienorenal ligament) (from the left kidney to the spleen)
    is occasionally considered part of the greater omentum. \n\nIt is derived from
    the peritoneum, where the wall of the general peritoneal cavity comes into contact
    with the lesser sac between the left kidney and the spleen; the splenic artery
    and vein pass between its two layers. \n\nIt contains the tail of the pancreas,
    the only intraperitoneal portion of the pancreas, and splenic vessels. \n\nOne
    or more of the preceding sentences incorporates text in the public domain from
    the 20th edition of Gray's Anatomy (1918)\n\n\n==== Phrenicosplenic ligament
    ====\nThe phrenosplenic ligament (lienophrenic ligament or phrenicolienal ligament)
    is a double fold of peritoneum that connects the thoracic diaphragm and spleen.The
    phrenicosplenic ligament is part of the greater omentum. \n\nDistinctions between
    the phrenicosplenic ligament and adjacent ligaments, such as the gastrophrenic,
    gastrosplenic and splenorenal ligaments, which are all part of the same mesenteric
    sheet, are often nebulous.\n\n\n=== Blood supply ===\n\nThe right and left gastroepiploic
    arteries (also known as gastroomental) provide the sole blood supply to the greater
    omentum. \n\nBoth are branches of the celiac trunk. \n\nThe right gastroepiploic
    artery is a branch of the gastroduodenal artery, which is a branch of the common
    hepatic artery, which is a branch of the celiac trunk. \n\nThe left gastroepiploic
    artery is the largest branch of the splenic artery, which is a branch of the
    celiac trunk. \n\nThe right and left gastroepiploic arteries anastomose within
    the two layers of the anterior greater omentum along the greater curvature of
    the stomach.\n\n\n=== Development ===\n\n\nThe greater omentum develops from
    the dorsal mesentery that connects the stomach to the posterior abdominal wall.
    \n\nDuring its development, the stomach undergoes its first 90\xB0 rotation along
    the axis of the embryo, so that posterior structures are moved to the left and
    structures anterior to the stomach are shifted to the right. \n\nAs a result,
    the dorsal mesentery folds over on itself, forming a pouch with its blind end
    on the left side of the embryo. \n\nA second approximately 90\xB0 rotation of
    the stomach, this time in the frontal plane, moves structures inferior if they
    were originally to the left of the stomach, and superior if they were originally
    to the stomach's right. \n\nConsequently, the blind-ended sac (also called the
    lesser sac) formed by the dorsal mesentery is brought inferiorly, where it assumes
    its final position as the greater omentum. \n\nIt grows to the point that it
    covers the majority of the small and large intestine.\n\n\n== Functions ==\n\nThe
    functions of the greater omentum are:\n\nFat deposition, having varying amounts
    of adipose tissue\nImmune contribution, having milky spots of macrophage collections\nInfection
    and wound isolation; It may also physically limit the spread of intraperitoneal
    infections. \n\nThe greater omentum can often be found wrapped around areas of
    infection and trauma.\n\n\n== Clinical significance ==\n\n\n\n=== Surgical removal
    ===\n\nOmentectomy refers to the surgical removal of the omentum, a relatively
    simple procedure with no documented major side effects, that is performed in
    cases where there is concern that there may be spread of cancerous tissue into
    the omentum. \n\nExamples for this are ovarian cancer and advanced or aggressive
    endometrial cancer as well as intestinal cancer and also appendix cancer. \n\nThe
    procedure is generally done as an add-on when the primary lesion is removed.\n\n\n===
    Omental flap ===\n\nThe greater omentum may be surgically harvested for reconstruction
    of the thoracic wall. \n\nIt has also been used experimentally to reinforce bioengineered
    tissues transplanted to the surface of the heart for cardiac regeneration.\n\n\n===
    Use in brain surgery ===\n\nThe greater omentum may be surgically harvested to
    provide revascularization of brain tissue after a stroke.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe
    greater omentum is also known as the great omentum, the omentum majus, the gastrocolic
    omentum, the epiploon, and the caul.\nIn 1906, the greater omentum was described
    as the \"abdominal policeman\" by the surgeon James Rutherford Morrison. \n\nThis
    is due to its immunological function, whereby omental tissue seems to \"surveil\"
    the abdomen for infection and cover areas of infection when found - walling it
    off with immunologically active tissue.\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_omentum"

  descriptionText: "\n\nTESTIS/\nTESTICLE\n\n\nTesticle or testis (plural testes)
    is the male reproductive gland or gonad in all animals, including humans. \n\nIt
    is homologous to the female ovary. \n\nThe functions of the testes are to produce
    both sperm and androgens, primarily testosterone. \n\nTestosterone release is
    controlled by the anterior pituitary luteinizing hormone, whereas sperm production
    is controlled both by the anterior pituitary follicle-stimulating hormone and
    gonadal testosterone.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\n=== Appearance ===\n\nMales have
    two testicles of similar size contained within the scrotum, which is an extension
    of the abdominal wall. \n\nScrotal asymmetry is not unusual: one testicle extends
    farther down into the scrotum than the other due to differences in the anatomy
    of the vasculature.\n\n\n=== Measurement ===\n\nThe volume of the testicle can
    be estimated by palpating it and comparing it to ellipsoids of known sizes. \n\nAnother
    method is to use calipers (an orchidometer) or a ruler either on the person or
    on an ultrasound image to obtain the three measurements of the x, y, and z axes
    (length, depth and width). \n\nThese measurements can then be used to calculate
    the volume, using the formula for the volume of an ellipsoid: \n\nAn average
    adult testicle measures up to 5 cm \xD7 2 cm \xD7 3 cm (2 in \xD7 3\u20444 in
    \xD7 1+1\u20444 in). \n\nThe Tanner scale for the maturity of male genitals assigns
    a maturity stage to the calculated volume ranging from stage I, a volume of less
    than 1.5 cm3; to stage V, a volume greater than 20 cm3. \n\nNormal volume is
    15 to 25 cm3; the average is 18 cm3 per testis (range 12\u201330 cm3).\n\n\n===
    Internal structure ===\n\n==== Duct system ====\n\nThe testes are covered by
    a tough membranous shell called the tunica albuginea. \n\nWithin the testes are
    very fine coiled tubes called seminiferous tubules. \n\nThe tubules are lined
    with a layer of cells (germ cells) that develop from puberty through old age
    into sperm cells (also known as spermatozoa or male gametes). \n\nThe developing
    sperm travel through the seminiferous tubules to the rete testis located in the
    mediastinum testis, to the efferent ducts, and then to the epididymis where newly
    created sperm cells mature (see spermatogenesis). \n\nThe sperm move into the
    vas deferens, and are eventually expelled through the urethra and out of the
    urethral orifice through muscular contractions.\n\n\n==== Primary cell types
    ====\n\nWithin the seminiferous tubules, the germ cells develop into spermatogonia,
    spermatocytes, spermatids and spermatozoon through the process of spermatogenesis.
    \n\nThe gametes contain DNA for fertilization of an ovum Sertoli cells \u2013
    the true epithelium of the seminiferous epithelium, critical for the support
    of germ cell development into spermatozoa. \n\nSertoli cells secrete inhibin.
    \n\nPeritubular myoid cells surround the seminiferous tubules.Between tubules
    (interstitial cells), exist Leydig cells \u2013 cells localized between seminiferous
    tubules that produce and secrete testosterone and other androgens important for
    sexual development and puberty, secondary sexual characteristics like facial
    hair, sexual behavior and libido. \n\nThey also support spermatogenesis and erectile
    function. \n\nTestosterone controls testicular volume. \nImmature Leydig cells
    and interstitial macrophages and epithelial cells are also present.\n\n\n====
    Blood supply and lymphatic drainage ====\n\nBlood supply and lymphatic drainage
    of the testes and scrotum are distinct:\n\nThe paired testicular arteries arise
    directly from the abdominal aorta and descend through the inguinal canal, while
    the scrotum and the rest of the external genitalia is supplied by the internal
    pudendal artery (itself a branch of the internal iliac artery).\n\nThe testis
    has collateral blood supply from \n1. the cremasteric artery (a branch of the
    inferior epigastric artery, which is a branch of the external iliac artery),
    \nand \n2. the artery to the ductus deferens (a branch of the inferior vesical
    artery, which is a branch of the internal iliac artery). \n\nTherefore, if the
    testicular artery is ligated, e.g., during a Fowler-Stevens orchiopexy for a
    high undescended testis, the testis will usually survive on these other blood
    supplies.\n\nLymphatic drainage of the testes follows the testicular arteries
    back to the paraaortic lymph nodes, while lymph from the scrotum drains to the
    inguinal lymph nodes.\n\n\n==== Layers ====\n\nMany anatomical features of the
    adult testis reflect its developmental origin in the abdomen. \n\nThe layers
    of tissue enclosing each testicle are derived from the layers of the anterior
    abdominal wall. \n\nNotably, the cremasteric muscle arises from the internal
    oblique muscle.\n\n\n==== The blood\u2013testis barrier ====\n\nLarge molecules
    cannot pass from the blood into the lumen of a seminiferous tubule due to the
    presence of tight junctions between adjacent Sertoli cells. \n\nThe spermatogonia
    are in the basal compartment (deep to the level of the tight junctions) and the
    more mature forms such as primary and secondary spermatocytes and spermatids
    are in the adluminal compartment.\n\nThe function of the blood\u2013testis barrier
    may be to prevent an auto-immune reaction. \n\nMature sperm (and their antigens)
    arise long after immune tolerance is established in infancy. \n\nSince sperm
    are antigenically different from self tissue, a male animal can react immunologically
    to his own sperm. \n\nHe is capable of making antibodies against them.\n\nInjection
    of sperm antigens causes inflammation of the testis (auto-immune orchitis) and
    reduced fertility. \n\nThe blood\u2013testis barrier may reduce the likelihood
    that sperm proteins will induce an immune response, reducing fertility and so
    progeny.\n\n\n=== Temperature regulation ===\n\nSpermatogenesis is enhanced at
    temperatures slightly less than core body temperature. \n\nThe spermatogenesis
    is less efficient at lower and higher temperatures than 33 \xB0C. \n\nBecause
    the testes are located outside the body, the smooth tissue of the scrotum can
    move them closer or further away from the body. \n\nThe temperature of the testes
    is maintained at 35 degrees Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit), i.e. two degrees
    below the body temperature of 37 degrees Celsius (98.6 degrees Fahrenheit). \n\nHigher
    temperatures affect spermatogenesis. \n\nThere are a number of mechanisms to
    maintain the testes at the optimum temperature.\n\nThe cremasteric muscle is
    part of the spermatic cord. \n\nWhen this muscle contracts, the cord is shortened
    and the testicle is moved closer up toward the body, which provides slightly
    more warmth to maintain optimal testicular temperature. \n\nWhen cooling is required,
    the cremasteric muscle relaxes and the testicle is lowered away from the warm
    body and is able to cool. \n\nContraction also occurs in response to stress (the
    testicles rise up toward the body in an effort to protect them in a fight).\n\nThe
    cremaster muscle can reflexively raise each testicle individually if properly
    triggered. \n\nThis phenomenon is known as the cremasteric reflex. \n\nThe testicles
    can also be lifted voluntarily using the pubococcygeus muscle, which partially
    activates related muscles.\n\n\n=== Gene and protein expression ===\n\n\nThe
    human genome includes approximately 20,000 protein coding genes: 80% of these
    genes are expressed in adult testes. \n\nThe testes have the highest fraction
    of tissue type-specific genes compared to other organs and tissues: about 1000
    of them are highly specific for the testes, and about 2,200 show an elevated
    pattern of expression here. \n\nA majority of these genes encode for proteins
    that are expressed in the seminiferous tubules and have functions related to
    spermatogenesis. \n\nSperm cells express proteins that result in the development
    of flagella; these same proteins are expressed in the female in cells lining
    the fallopian tube, and cause the development of cilia. \n\nIn other words, sperm
    cell flagella and Fallopian tube cilia are homologous structures. \n\nThe testis-specific
    proteins that show the highest level of expression are protamines.\n\n\n== Development
    ==\n\nThere are two phases in which the testes grow substantially; namely in
    embryonic and pubertal age.\n\n\n=== Embryonic ===\n\n\nDuring mammalian development,
    the gonads are at first capable of becoming either ovaries or testes. \n\nIn
    humans, starting at about week 4 the gonadal rudiments are present within the
    intermediate mesoderm adjacent to the developing kidneys. \n\nAt about week 6,
    sex cords develop within the forming testes. \n\nThese are made up of early Sertoli
    cells that surround and nurture the germ cells that migrate into the gonads shortly
    before sex determination begins. \n\nIn males, the sex-specific gene SRY that
    is found on the Y-chromosome initiates sex determination by downstream regulation
    of sex-determining factors, (such as GATA4, SOX9 and AMH), which leads to development
    of the male phenotype, including directing development of the early bipotential
    gonad down the male path of development.\n\nTestes follow the \"path of descent\"
    from high in the posterior fetal abdomen to the inguinal ring and beyond to the
    inguinal canal and into the scrotum. \n\nIn most cases (97% full-term, 70% preterm),
    both testes have descended by birth. \n\nIn most other cases, only one testis
    fails to descend (cryptorchidism) and that will probably express itself within
    a year.\n\n\n=== Pubertal ===\n\nThe testes grow in response to the start of
    spermatogenesis. \n\nSize depends on lytic function, sperm production (amount
    of spermatogenesis present in testis), interstitial fluid, and Sertoli cell fluid
    production. \n\nAfter puberty, the volume of the testes can be increased by over
    500% as compared to the pre-pubertal size. \n\nTesticles are fully descended
    before one reaches puberty.\n\n\n== Clinical significance ==\n\n=== Protection
    and injury ===\n\n\nThe testicles are well known to be very sensitive to impact
    and injury. \n\nThe pain involved travels up from each testicle into the abdominal
    cavity, via the spermatic plexus, which is the primary nerve of each testicle.
    \n\nThis will cause pain in the hip and the back. \nThe pain usually goes away
    in a few minutes.\n\nTesticular torsion is a medical emergency.\n\nTesticular
    rupture is a medical emergency caused by blunt force impact, sharp edge, or piercing
    impact to one or both testicles, which can lead to necrosis of the testis in
    as little as 30 minutes.\n\nPenetrating injuries to the scrotum may cause castration,
    or physical separation or destruction of the testes, possibly along with part
    or all of the penis, which results in total sterility if the testicles are not
    reattached quickly.\n\nSome jockstraps are designed to provide support to the
    testicles.\n\n\n=== Diseases and conditions ===\n\n-Testicular cancer and other
    neoplasms \u2013 \n\nTo improve the chances of catching possible cases of testicular
    cancer or other health issues early, regular testicular self-examination is recommended.\n\n-Varicocele,
    swollen vein(s) from the testes, usually affecting the left side, the testis
    usually being normal.\n\n-Hydrocele testis, swelling around testes caused by
    accumulation of clear liquid within a membranous sac, the testis usually being
    normal\n\n-Spermatocele, a retention cyst of a tubule of the rete testis or the
    head of the epididymis distended with barely watery fluid that contains spermatozoa.\n\n-Endocrine
    disorders can also affect the size and function of the testis.\n\n-Certain inherited
    conditions involving mutations in key developmental genes also impair testicular
    descent, resulting in abdominal or inguinal testes which remain nonfunctional
    and may become cancerous. \n\n-Other genetic conditions can result in the loss
    of the Wolffian ducts and allow for the persistence of M\xFCllerian ducts. \n\n-Both
    excess and deficient levels of estrogens can disrupt spermatogenesis and cause
    infertility.\n\n-Bell-clapper deformity is a deformity in which the testicle
    is not attached to the scrotal walls, and can rotate freely on the spermatic
    cord within the tunica vaginalis. \n\nIt is the most common underlying cause
    of testicular torsion.\n\n-Orchitis inflammation of the testicles\n-Epididymitis,
    a painful inflammation of the epididymis or epididymides frequently caused by
    bacterial infection but sometimes of unknown origin.\n-Anorchia, the absence
    of one or both testicles.\n-Cryptorchidism or \"undescended testicles\", when
    the testicle does not descend into the scrotum of the infant boy.\n-Testicular
    enlargement is an unspecific sign of various testicular diseases, and can be
    defined as a testicular size of more than 5 cm (long axis) \xD7 3 cm (short axis).\n-Blue
    balls is a slang term for a temporary fluid congestion in the testicles and prostate
    region caused by prolonged sexual arousal.\n-Testicular prostheses are available
    to mimic the appearance and feel of one or both testicles, when absent as from
    injury or as treatment in association to gender dysphoria. \n\nThere have also
    been some instances of their implantation in dogs.\n\n\n=== Effects of exogenous
    hormones ===\n\nTo some extent, it is possible to change testicular size. \n\nShort
    of direct injury or subjecting them to adverse conditions, e.g., higher temperature
    than they are normally accustomed to, they can be shrunk by competing against
    their intrinsic hormonal function through the use of externally administered
    steroidal hormones. \n\nSteroids taken for muscle enhancement (especially anabolic
    steroids) often have the undesired side effect of testicular shrinkage.\n\nSimilarly,
    stimulation of testicular functions via gonadotropic-like hormones may enlarge
    their size. \n\nTestes may shrink or atrophy during hormone replacement therapy
    or through chemical castration.\n\nIn all cases, the loss in testes volume corresponds
    with a loss of spermatogenesis.\n\n\n== Society and culture ==\n\n\nThe testicles
    of calves, lambs, roosters, turkeys, and other animals are eaten in many parts
    of the world, often under euphemistic culinary names. \n\nTesticles are a by-product
    of the castration of young animals raised for meat, so they were probably a late-spring
    seasonal specialty, though nowadays they are generally frozen and available year-round.\n\nAs
    early as 330 BC, Aristotle prescribed the ligation (tying off) of the left testicle
    in men wishing to have boys. \n\nIn the Middle Ages, men who wanted a boy sometimes
    had their left testicle removed. \n\nThis was because people believed that the
    right testicle made \"boy\" sperm and the left made \"girl\" sperm.\n\n\n== Etymology
    and slang ==\n\nOne theory about the etymology of the word testis is based on
    Roman law. \n\nThe original Latin word testis, \"witness\", was used in the firmly
    established legal principle \"Testis unus, testis nullus\" (one witness [equals]
    no witness), meaning that testimony by any one person in court was to be disregarded
    unless corroborated by the testimony of at least another. \n\nThis led to the
    common practice of producing two witnesses, bribed to testify the same way in
    cases of lawsuits with ulterior motives. \n\nSince such \"witnesses\" always
    came in pairs, the meaning was accordingly extended, often in the diminutive
    (testiculus, testiculi).\n\nAnother theory says that testis is influenced by
    a loan translation, from Greek parastat\u0113s \"defender (in law), supporter\"
    that is \"two glands side by side\".In slang, the testes are usually referred
    to as \"balls\" as a reference to blue balls. \n\nFrequently, \"nuts\" (sometimes
    intentionally misspelled as \"nutz\") are also a slang term for the testes due
    to the geometric resemblance, as evidenced by the various usages of the term
    \"Deez Nuts\", which include a satirical political candidate in 2016.\n\n\n==
    Other animals ==\n\n=== External appearance ===\n\nIn sharks, the testicle on
    the right side is usually larger, and in many bird and mammal species, the left
    may be the larger. \n\nThe primitive jawless fish have only a single testis,
    located in the midline of the body, although even this forms from the fusion
    of paired structures in the embryo.\n\nIn seasonal breeders, the weight of the
    testes often increases during the breeding season. \n\nThe testicles of a dromedary
    camel are 7\u201310 cm (2.8\u20133.9 in) long, 4.5 cm (1.8 in) deep and 5 cm
    (2.0 in) in width. \n\nThe right testicle is often smaller than the left.\n\n\n===
    Location ===\n\n==== Internal ====\n\nThe basal condition for mammals is to have
    internal testes. \n\nThe testes of monotremes, xenarthrans, and elephants remain
    within the abdomen. \n\nThere are also some marsupials with external testes and
    Boreoeutherian mammals with internal testes, such as the rhinoceros. \n\nCetaceans
    such as whales and dolphins also have internal testes. \n\nAs external testes
    would increase drag in the water they have internal testes which are kept cool
    by special circulatory systems that cool the arterial blood going to the testes
    by placing the arteries near veins bringing cooled venous blood from the skin.
    \n\nIn odobenids and phocids, the location of the testes is para-abdominal, though
    otariids have scrotal testes.\n\n\n==== External ====\n\nBoreoeutherian land
    mammals, the large group of mammals that includes humans, have externalized testes.
    \n\nTheir testes function best at temperatures lower than their core body temperature.
    \n\nTheir testes are located outside of the body, suspended by the spermatic
    cord within the scrotum.\n\nThere are several hypotheses why most boreotherian
    mammals have external testes which operate best at a temperature that is slightly
    less than the core body temperature, e.g. that it is stuck with enzymes evolved
    in a colder temperature due to external testes evolving for different reasons,
    that the lower temperature of the testes simply is more efficient for sperm production.\n\n   
    1) More efficient. \n\nThe classic hypothesis is that cooler temperature of the
    testes allows for more efficient fertile spermatogenesis. \n\nIn other words,
    there are no possible enzymes operating at normal core body temperature that
    are as efficient as the ones evolved, at least none appearing in our evolution
    so far.\n\nThe early mammals had lower body temperatures and thus their testes
    worked efficiently within their body. \n\nHowever it is argued that boreotherian
    mammals have higher body temperatures than the other mammals and had to develop
    external testes to keep them cool. \n\nIt is argued that those mammals with internal
    testes, such as the monotremes, armadillos, sloths, elephants, and rhinoceroses,
    have a lower core body temperatures than those mammals with external testes.\n\nHowever,
    the question remains why birds despite having very high core body temperatures
    have internal testes and did not evolve external testes. \n\nIt was once theorized
    that birds used their air sacs to cool the testes internally, but later studies
    revealed that birds' testes are able to function at core body temperature.\n\nSome
    mammals which have seasonal breeding cycles keep their testes internal until
    the breeding season at which point their testes descend and increase in size
    and become external.\n\n    2) Irreversible adaptation to sperm competition.
    \n\nIt has been suggested that the ancestor of the boreoeutherian mammals was
    a small mammal that required very large testes (perhaps rather like those of
    a hamster) for sperm competition and thus had to place its testes outside the
    body. \n\nThis led to enzymes involved in spermatogenesis, spermatogenic DNA
    polymerase beta and recombinase activities evolving a unique temperature optimum,
    slightly less than core body temperature. \n\nWhen the boreoeutherian mammals
    then diversified into forms that were larger and/or did not require intense sperm
    competition they still produced enzymes that operated best at cooler temperatures
    and had to keep their testes outside the body. \n\nThis position is made less
    parsimonious by the fact that the kangaroo, a non-boreoeutherian mammal, has
    external testicles. \n\nThe ancestors of kangaroos might, separately from boreotherian
    mammals, have also been subject to heavy sperm competition and thus developed
    external testes, however, kangaroo external testes are suggestive of a possible
    adaptive function for external testes in large animals.\n\n    3) Protection
    from abdominal cavity pressure changes. \n\nOne argument for the evolution of
    external testes is that it protects the testes from abdominal cavity pressure
    changes caused by jumping and galloping.\n\n    4) Protection against DNA damage.
    \n\nMild, transient scrotal heat stress causes DNA damage, reduced fertility
    and abnormal embryonic development in mice. \n\nDNA strand breaks were found
    in spermatocytes recovered from testicles subjected to 40 \xB0C or 42 \xB0C for
    30 minutes. \n\nThese findings suggest that the external location of the testicles
    provides the adaptive benefit of protecting spermatogenic cells from heat-induced
    DNA damage that could otherwise lead to infertility and germline mutation.\n\n\n===
    Size ===\n\nThe relative size of testes is often influenced by mating systems.
    \n\nTesticular size as a proportion of body weight varies widely. \n\nIn the
    mammalian kingdom, there is a tendency for testicular size to correspond with
    multiple mates (e.g., harems, polygamy). \n\nProduction of testicular output
    sperm and spermatic fluid is also larger in polygamous animals, possibly a spermatogenic
    competition for survival. \n\nThe testes of the right whale are likely to be
    the largest of any animal, each weighing around 500 kg (1,100 lb).\n\nAmong the
    Hominidae, gorillas have little female promiscuity and sperm competition and
    the testes are small compared to body weight (0.03%). \n\nChimpanzees have high
    promiscuity and large testes compared to body weight (0.3%). \n\nHuman testicular
    size falls between these extremes (0.08%).Testis weight also varies in seasonal
    breeders like red foxes, golden jackals and coyotes.\n\n\n=== Internal structure
    ===\n\nUnder a tough membranous shell called the tunica albuginea, the testis
    of amniotes, as well as some teleost fish, contains very fine coiled tubes called
    seminiferous tubules.\n\nAmphibians and most fish do not possess seminiferous
    tubules. \n\nInstead, the sperm are produced in spherical structures called sperm
    ampullae. \n\nThese are seasonal structures, releasing their contents during
    the breeding season, and then being reabsorbed by the body. \n\nBefore the next
    breeding season, new sperm ampullae begin to form and ripen. \n\nThe ampullae
    are otherwise essentially identical to the seminiferous tubules in higher vertebrates,
    including the same range of cell types.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testicle"

  descriptionText: "\n\nBILE DUCT\n\n\nA bile duct is any of a number of long tube-like
    structures that carry bile, and is present in most vertebrates.\nBile is required
    for the digestion of food and is secreted by the liver into passages that carry
    bile toward the hepatic duct. \n\nIt joins the cystic duct (carrying bile to
    and from the gallbladder) to form the common bile duct which then opens into
    the intestine.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe top half of the common bile duct is
    associated with the liver, while the bottom half of the common bile duct is associated
    with the pancreas, through which it passes on its way to the intestine. \n\nIt
    opens into the part of the intestine called the duodenum via the ampulla of Vater.\n\n\n==
    Segments ==\n\nThe biliary tree (see below) is the whole network of various sized
    ducts branching through the liver.\nThe path is as follows: Bile canaliculi \u2192
    Canals of Hering \u2192 interlobular bile ducts \u2192 intrahepatic bile ducts
    \u2192 left and right hepatic ducts merge to form \u2192 common hepatic duct
    exits liver and joins \u2192 cystic duct (from gall bladder) forming \u2192 common
    bile duct \u2192 joins with pancreatic duct \u2192 forming ampulla of Vater \u2192
    enters duodenum.\n\n\n=== Nerve supply ===\n\nInflation of a balloon in the bile
    duct causes, through the vagus nerve, activation of the brain stem and the insular
    cortex, prefrontal cortex, and somatosensory cortex.\n\n\n== Clinical significance
    ==\n\n\n\n=== Blockage ===\n\nBlockage or obstruction of the bile duct by gallstones,
    scarring from injury, or cancer prevents the bile from being transported to the
    intestine and the active ingredient in the bile (bilirubin) instead accumulates
    in the blood. \n\nThis condition results in jaundice, where the skin and eyes
    become yellow from the bilirubin in the blood. \n\nThis condition also causes
    severe itchiness from the bilirubin deposited in the tissues. \n\nIn certain
    types of jaundice, the urine will be noticeably darker, and the stools will be
    much paler than usual. \n\nThis is caused by the bilirubin all going to the bloodstream
    and being filtered into the urine by the kidneys, instead of some being lost
    in the stools through the ampulla of Vater.\n\n\n==== Jaundice ====\nJaundice
    is commonly caused by conditions such as pancreatic cancer, which causes blockage
    of the bile duct passing through the cancerous portion of the pancreas; cholangiocarcinoma,
    cancer of the bile ducts; blockage by a stone in patients with gallstones; and
    from scarring after injury to the bile duct during gallbladder removal.\n\n\n====
    Drainage ====\nBiliary drainage is performed with a tube or catheter (called
    a biliary drain, biliary stent or biliary catheter) by a surgeon or, commonly,
    an interventional radiologist. \n\nIt can be used to relieve a blockage in the
    bile duct, either permanently or as a temporary solution before definite treatment
    such as surgery. \n\nThe drain can be placed percutaneously through the liver,
    with the procedure then being called percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage
    (PTBD). \n\nThis can additionally be performed as part of a percutaneous transhepatic
    cholangiography, then a form of interventional radiology. \n\nA biliary drain
    can also be used to take bile samples for diagnostic workup or disease monitoring,
    as well as providing a route of administration for medical substances.\n\nA surgically
    created passage between the common bile duct and the jejunum in a procedure called
    a choledochojejunostomy, can be carried out to relieve the symptoms of biliary
    obstruction.\nIn infants with biliary atresia, hepatoportoenterostomy is an alternative
    method of providing bile drainage.\n\n\n=== Cholangiocarcinoma ===\n\n\nCholangiocarcinoma
    or bile duct cancer is a form of cancer that is composed of mutated epithelial
    cells (or cells showing characteristics of epithelial differentiation) that originate
    in the bile ducts. \n\nCholangiocarcinoma is considered to be an incurable and
    rapidly lethal cancer unless both the primary tumor and any metastases can be
    fully removed by surgery. \n\nNo potentially curative treatment exists except
    surgery, but most people have advanced stage disease at presentation and are
    inoperable at the time of diagnosis.\n\n\n=== Injury ===\n\nIn cholecystectomy
    there is a slight risk (0.3\u20130.5%) of injury of the bile ducts, most commonly
    of the common bile duct. \n\nThis complication can range from mild forms, which
    are easy to address during the operation, to more severe forms. \n\nIf not addressed
    such injury can be debilitating and lead to considerable morbidity. \n\nSuch
    injury can be prevented by routinely using X-ray investigation of the bile ducts
    (intraoperative cholangiography (IOC)).\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bile_duct"

    INFERIOR PARATHYROID GLAND



    The two parathyroid
    glands on each side which are positioned higher are called the superior parathyroid
    glands, while the lower two are called the inferior parathyroid glands.

  descriptionText: "\n\nDUCTUS DEFERENS/VAS DEFERENS\n\n\nThe vas deferens, or ductus
    deferens, is part of the male reproductive system of many vertebrates. \n\nThe
    ducts transport sperm from the epididymis to the ejaculatory ducts in anticipation
    of ejaculation. \n\nThe vas deferens is a partially coiled tube which exits the
    abdominal cavity through the inguinal canal.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nVas deferens
    is Latin, meaning \"carrying-away vessel\"; the plural version is vasa deferentia.
    \n\nDuctus deferens is also Latin, meaning \"carrying-away duct\"; the plural
    version is ductus deferentes.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThere are two vasa deferentia,
    connecting the left and right epididymis with the seminal vesicles to form the
    ejaculatory duct in order to move sperm. \n\nIn humans, each tube is about 30
    centimeters (1 ft) long, 3 to 5 mm (0.118 to 0.197 inches) in diameter and is
    muscular (surrounded by smooth muscle). \n\nIts epithelium is pseudostratified
    columnar epithelium lined by stereocilia.\nThey are part of the spermatic cords.\n\n\n===
    Blood supply ===\n\nThe vas deferens is supplied by an accompanying artery (artery
    of vas deferens). \n\nThis artery normally arises from the superior (sometimes
    inferior) vesical artery, a branch of the internal iliac artery.\n\n\n=== Nerve
    supply ===\n\nThe vas deferens is innervated by a variety of different types
    of nerve ending. \n\nAdrenergic synapses are found in the smooth muscle layers.
    \n\nCholinergic synapses and vasoactive intestinal peptide synapses are found
    in the connective tissue of the mucosa. \n\nNoradrenergic synapses may also be
    present in the vas deferens.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\nDuring ejaculation, the smooth
    muscle in the walls of the vas deferens contracts reflexively, thus propelling
    the sperm forward. \n\nThis is also known as peristalsis. \n\nThe sperm is transferred
    from each vas deferens into the urethra, partially mixing with secretions from
    the male accessory sex glands such as the seminal vesicles, prostate gland and
    the bulbourethral glands, which form the bulk of semen.\n\n\n== Clinical significance
    ==\n\n\n\n=== Contraception ===\n\nA vasectomy is a method of contraception in
    which the vasa deferentia are permanently cut, though in some cases it can be
    reversed. \n\nA modern variation, which is also known as a vasectomy even though
    it does not include cutting the vas, involves injecting an obstructive material
    into the ductus to block the flow of sperm.\n\nInvestigational attempts for male
    contraception have focused on the vas with the use of the intra vas device and
    reversible inhibition of sperm under guidance.\n\n\n=== Disease ===\n\nThe vas
    deferens may be obstructed, or it may be completely absent in a condition known
    as congenital absence of the vas deferens (CAVD, a potential feature of cystic
    fibrosis), causing male infertility. \n\nAcquired obstructions can occur due
    to infections. \n\nTo treat these causes of male infertility, sperm can be harvested
    by testicular sperm extraction (TESE), microsurgical epididymal sperm aspiration
    (MESA), or other methods of collecting sperm cells directly from the testicle
    or epididymis.\n\n\n=== Uses in pharmacology and physiology ===\n\nThe vas deferens
    has a dense sympathetic innervation, making it a useful system for studying sympathetic
    nerve function and for studying drugs that modify neurotransmission.It has been
    used:\n\n-as a bioassay for the discovery of enkephalins, the endogenous opiates.\n\n-to
    demonstrate quantal transmission from sympathetic nerve terminals.\n\n-as the
    first direct measure of free Ca2+ concentration in a postganglionic nerve terminal.\n\n-to
    develop an optical method for monitoring packeted transmission (similar to quantal
    transmission).\n\n\n== Other animals ==\n\nMost vertebrates have some form of
    duct to transfer the sperm from the testes to the urethra. \n\nIn cartilaginous
    fish and amphibians, sperm is carried through the archinephric duct, which also
    partially helps to transport urine from the kidneys. \n\nIn teleosts, there is
    a distinct sperm duct, separate from the ureters, and often called the vas deferens,
    although probably not truly homologous with that in humans. \n\nThe vas deferens
    loops over the ureter in placental mammals, but not in marsupial mammals.\n\nIn
    cartilaginous fishes, the part of the archinephric duct closest to the testis
    is coiled up to form an epididymis. \n\nBelow this are a number of small glands
    secreting components of the seminal fluid. \n\nThe final portion of the duct
    also receives ducts from the kidneys in most species.In amniotes, however, the
    archinephric duct has become a true vas deferens, and is used only for conducting
    sperm, never urine. \n\nAs in cartilaginous fish, the upper part of the duct
    forms the epididymis. \n\nIn many species, the vas deferens ends in a small sac
    for storing sperm.The only vertebrates to lack any structure resembling a vas
    deferens are the primitive jawless fishes, which release sperm directly into
    the body cavity, and then into the surrounding water through a simple opening
    in the body wall.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vas_deferens"

  descriptionText: "\n\nSEMINAL GLANDS/SEMINAL VESICLES\n\n\nThe seminal vesicles
    (also called vesicular glands, or seminal glands) are a pair of two convoluted
    tubular glands that lie behind the urinary bladder of some male mammals. \n\nThey
    secrete fluid that partly composes the semen.\n\nThe vesicles are 5\u201310 cm
    in size, 3\u20135 cm in diameter, and are located between the bladder and the
    rectum. \n\nThey have multiple outpouchings which contain secretory glands, which
    join together with the vas deferens as the ejaculatory duct. \n\nThey receive
    blood from the vesiculodeferential artery, and drain into the vesiculodeferential
    veins. \n\nThe glands are lined with column-shaped and cuboidal cells. \n\nThe
    vesicles are present in many groups of mammals, but not marsupials, monotremes
    or carnivores.\n\nInflammation of the seminal vesicles is called seminal vesiculitis,
    most often is due to bacterial infection as a result of a sexually transmitted
    disease or following a surgical procedure. \n\nSeminal vesiculitis can cause
    pain in the lower abdomen, scrotum, penis or peritoneum, painful ejaculation,
    and blood in the semen. \n\nIt is usually treated with antibiotics, although
    may require surgical drainage in complicated cases. \n\nOther conditions may
    affect the vesicles, including congenital abnormalities such as failure or incomplete
    formation, and, uncommonly, tumours.\n\nThe seminal vesicles have been described
    as early as the second century AD by Galen, although the vesicles only received
    their name much later, as they were initially described using the term from which
    the word prostate is derived.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe seminal vesicles are
    a pair of glands in males that are positioned below the urinary bladder and at
    the end of the vasa deferentia, where they enter the prostate. \n\nEach vesicle
    is a coiled and folded tube, with occasional outpouchings termed diverticula
    in its wall. \n\nThe lower part of the tube ends as a straight tube called the
    excretory duct which joins with the vas deferens of that side of the body to
    form an ejaculatory duct. \n\nThe ejaculatory ducts pass through the prostate
    gland before opening separately into the verumontanum of the prostatic urethra.
    \n\nThe vesicles are between 5\u201310 cm in size, 3\u20135 cm in diameter, and
    have a volume of around 13 mL.The vesicles receive blood supply from the vesiculodeferential
    artery, and also from the inferior vesical artery. \n\nThe vesiculodeferential
    artery arises from the umbilical arteries, which branch directly from the internal
    iliac arteries. \n\nBlood is drained into the vesiculodeferential veins and the
    inferior vesical plexus, which drain into the internal iliac veins. \n\nLymphatic
    drainage occurs along the venous routes, draining into the internal iliac nodes.The
    vesicles lie behind the bladder at the end of the vasa deferentia. \n\nThey lie
    in the space between the bladder and the rectum; the bladder and prostate lie
    in front, the tip of the ureter as it enters the bladder above, and Denonvilliers
    fascia and the rectum behind.\n\n\n=== Development ===\n\n\nIn the developing
    embryo, at the hind end lies a cloaca. \n\nThis, over the fourth to the seventh
    week, divides into a urogenital sinus and the beginnings of the anal canal, with
    a wall forming between these two inpouchings called the urorectal septum. \n\nTwo
    ducts form next to each other that connect to the urogenital sinus; the mesonephric
    duct and the paramesonephric duct, which go on to form the reproductive tracts
    of the male and female respectively.In the male, under the influence of testosterone,
    the mesonephric duct proliferates, forming the epididymis, ductus deferens and,
    via a small outpouching near the developing prostate, the seminal vesicles. \n\nSertoli
    cells secrete anti-mullerian hormone, which causes the paramesonephric duct to
    regress.\n\nThe development and maintenance of the seminal vesicles, as well
    as their secretion and size/weight, are highly dependent on androgens. \n\nThe
    seminal vesicles contain 5\u03B1-reductase, which metabolizes testosterone into
    its much more potent metabolite, dihydrotestosterone (DHT). \n\nThe seminal vesicles
    have also been found to contain luteinizing hormone receptors, and hence may
    also be regulated by the ligand of this receptor, luteinizing hormone.\n\n\n===
    Microanatomy ===\n\nThe inner lining of the seminal vesicles (the epithelium)
    is made of a lining of interspersed column-shaped and cube-shaped cells. \n\nThere
    are varying descriptions of the lining as being pseudostratified and consisting
    of column-shaped cells only. \n\nWhen viewed under a microscope, the cells are
    seen to have large bubbles in their interior. \n\nThis is because their interior,
    called cytoplasm, contains lipid droplets involved in secretion during ejaculation.
    \n\nThe tissue of the seminal vesicles is full of glands, spaced irregularly.
    \n\nAs well as glands, the seminal vesicles contain smooth muscle and connective
    tissue. \n\nThis fibrous and muscular tissue surrounds the glands, helping to
    expel their contents. \n\nThe outer surface of the glands is covered in peritoneum.\n\n\t\t\n==
    Function ==\n\nThe seminal vesicles secrete a significant proportion of the fluid
    that ultimately becomes semen. \n\nFluid is secreted from the ejaculatory ducts
    of the vesicles into the vas deferens, where it becomes part of semen. \n\nThis
    then passes through the urethra, where it is ejaculated during a male sexual
    response.About 70-85% of the seminal fluid in humans originates from the seminal
    vesicles. \n\nThe fluid consists of nutrients including fructose and citric acid,
    prostaglandins, and fibrinogen. \n\nNutrients help support sperm until fertilisation
    occurs; prostaglandins may also assist by softening mucous of the cervix, and
    by causing reverse contractions of parts of the female reproductive tract such
    as the fallopian tubes, to ensure that sperm are less likely to be expelled.\n\n\n==
    Clinical significance ==\n\n\n\n=== Disease ===\n\nSeminal vesiculitis (also
    known as spermatocystitis) is an inflammation of the seminal vesicles, most often
    caused by bacterial infection. \n\nSymptoms can include vague back or lower abdominal
    pain; pain of the penis, scrotum or peritoneum; painful ejaculation; blood in
    the semen on ejaculation; irritative and obstructive voiding symptoms; and impotence.
    \n\nInfection may be due to sexually transmitted infections, as a complication
    of a procedure such as prostate biopsy. \n\nIt is usually treated with antibiotics.
    \n\nIf a person experiences ongoing discomfort, transurethral seminal vesiculoscopy
    may be considered. \n\nIntervention in the form of drainage through the skin
    or surgery may also be required if the infection becomes an abscess. \n\nThe
    seminal vesicles may also be affected by tuberculosis, schistosomiasis and hydatid
    disease. \n\nThese diseases are investigated, diagnosed and treated according
    to the underlying disease.\n\nCongenital anomalies associated with the seminal
    vesicles include failure to develop, either completely (agenesis) or partially
    (hypoplasia), and cysts. \n\nFailure of the vesicles to form is often associated
    with absent vas deferens, or an abnormal connection between the vas deferens
    and the ureter. \n\nThe seminal vesicles may also be affected by cysts, amyloidosis,
    and stones. \n\nStones or cysts that become infected, or obstruct the vas deferens
    or seminal vesicles, may require surgical intervention.\n\nBenign tumours of
    the seminal vesicles are rare. \n\nWhen they do occur, they are usually papillary
    adenomas and cystadenomas. \n\nThey do not cause elevation of tumour markers,
    and are usually diagnosed based examination of tissue that has been removed after
    surgery. \n\nPrimary adenocarcinoma of the seminal vesicles, although rare, constitutes
    the most common malignant cancer of the seminal vesicles; that said, the majority
    of malignant cancers affecting the vesicles are lesions that have extended into
    the vesicles from nearby parts of the body. \n\nWhen adenocarcinoma occurs, it
    can cause blood in the urine, blood in the semen, painful urination, urinary
    retention, or even urinary obstruction. \n\nAdenocarcinomata are usually diagnosed
    after they are excised, based on tissue diagnosis. \n\nSome produce the tumour
    marker Ca-125, which can be used to monitor for reoccurence afterwards. \n\nEven
    rarer neoplasms include sarcoma, squamous cell carcinoma, yolk sac tumor, neuroendocrine
    carcinoma, paraganglioma, epithelial stromal tumors and lymphoma.\n\n\n=== Investigations
    ===\n\nSymptoms due to diseases of the seminal vesicles may be vague and not
    able to be specifically attributable to the vesicles themselves; additionally,
    some conditions such as tumours or cysts may not cause any symptoms at all. \n\nWhen
    diseases is suspected, such as due to pain on ejaculation, blood in the urine,
    infertility, due to urinary tract obstruction, further investigations may be
    conducted.\n\nA digital rectal examination, which involves a finger inserted
    by a medical practitioner through the anus, may cause greater than usual tenderness
    of the prostate gland, or may reveal a large seminal vesicle. \n\nA urine specimen
    may be collected, and is likely to demonstrate blood within the urine. \n\nLaboratory
    examination of seminal vesicle fluid requires a semen sample, e.g. for semen
    culture or semen analysis. \n\nFructose levels provide a measure of seminal vesicle
    function and, if absent, bilateral agenesis or obstruction is suspected.\n\nImaging
    of the vesicles is provided by medical imaging; either by transrectal ultrasound,
    CT or MRI scans. \n\nAn examination using cystoscopy, where a flexible tube is
    inserted in the urethra, may show disease of the vesicles because of changes
    in the normal appearance of the nearby bladder trigone, or prostatic urethra.\n\n\n==
    Other animals ==\n\nThe evolution of seminal vesicles may have been influenced
    by sexual selection. \n\nThey occur in many groups of mammals, but are absent
    in marsupials, monotremes, and carnivores. \n\nThe function is similar in all
    mammals they are present in, which is to secrete a fluid as part of semen that
    is ejaculated during the sexual response.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe action of
    the seminal vesicles has been described as early the second century AD by Galen,
    as \"glandular bodies\" that secrete substances alongside semen during reproduction.
    \n\nBy the time of Herophilus the presence of the glands and associated ducts
    had been described. \n\nAround the time of the early 17th century the word used
    to describe the vesicles, parastatai, eventually and unambiguously was used to
    refer to the prostate gland, rather than the vesicles. \n\nThe first time the
    prostate was portrayed in an individual drawing was by Reiner De Graaf in 1678.\n\nThe
    first described use of laparoscopic surgery on the vesicles was described in
    1993; this is now the preferred approach because of decreased pain, complications,
    and a shorter hospital stay.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seminal_vesicles"
