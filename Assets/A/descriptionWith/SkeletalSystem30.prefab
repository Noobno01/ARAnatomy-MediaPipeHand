    (singular: vertebra) are the vertebrae of the neck, immediately below the skull.
    \n\nTruncal vertebrae (divided into thoracic and lumbar vertebrae in mammals)
    lie caudal (toward the tail) of cervical vertebrae. \n\nIn sauropsid species,
    the cervical vertebrae bear cervical ribs. \n\nIn lizards and saurischian dinosaurs,
    the cervical ribs are large; in birds, they are small and completely fused to
    the vertebrae. \n\nThe vertebral transverse processes of mammals are homologous
    to the cervical ribs of other amniotes. \n\nMost mammals have seven cervical
    vertebrae, with the only three known exceptions being the manatee with six, the
    two-toed sloth with five or six, and the three-toed sloth with nine.\n\nIn humans,
    cervical vertebrae are the smallest of the true vertebrae and can be readily
    distinguished from those of the thoracic or lumbar regions by the presence of
    a foramen (hole) in each transverse process, through which the vertebral artery,
    vertebral veins, and inferior cervical ganglion pass. \n\nThe remainder of this
    article focuses upon human anatomy.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\n\nBy convention,
    the cervical vertebrae are numbered, with the first one (C1) closest to the skull
    and higher numbered vertebrae (C2\u2013C7) proceeding away from the skull and
    down the spine.\n\nThe general characteristics of the third through sixth cervical
    vertebrae are described here. \n\nThe first, second, and seventh vertebrae are
    extraordinary, and are detailed later.\n\nThe bodies of these four vertebrae
    are small, and broader from side to side than from front to back.\n\nThe anterior
    and posterior surfaces are flattened and of equal depth; the former is placed
    on a lower level than the latter, and its inferior border is prolonged downward,
    so as to overlap the upper and forepart of the vertebra below.\n\nThe upper surface
    is concave transversely, and presents a projecting lip on either side.\n\nThe
    lower surface is concave from front to back, convex from side to side, and presents
    laterally shallow concavities that receive the corresponding projecting lips
    of the underlying vertebra.\n\nThe pedicles are directed laterally and backward,
    and attach to the body midway between its upper and lower borders, so that the
    superior vertebral notch is as deep as the inferior, but it is, at the same time,
    narrower.\n\nThe laminae are narrow and thinner above than below; the vertebral
    foramen is large and of a triangular form.\nThe spinous process is short and
    bifid, the two divisions being often of unequal size. \n\nBecause the spinous
    processes are so short, certain superficial muscles (the trapezius and splenius
    capitis) attach to the nuchal ligament rather than directly to the vertebrae;
    the nuchal ligament itself attaching to the spinous processes of C2\u2013C7 and
    to the posterior tubercle of the atlas.\n\nThe superior and inferior articular
    processes of cervical vertebrae have fused on either or both sides to form articular
    pillars, columns of bone that project laterally from the junction of the pedicle
    and lamina.\n\nThe articular facets are flat and of an oval form:\nthe superior
    face backward, upward, and slightly medially.\nthe inferior face forward, downward,
    and slightly laterally.\n\nThe transverse processes are each pierced by the foramen
    transversarium, which, in the upper six vertebrae, gives passage to the vertebral
    artery and vein, as well as a plexus of sympathetic nerves. \n\nEach process
    consists of an anterior and a posterior part. \n\nThese two parts are joined,
    outside the foramen, by a bar of bone that exhibits a deep sulcus on its upper
    surface for the passage of the corresponding spinal nerve.\n\nThe anterior portion
    is the homologue of the rib in the thoracic region, and is therefore named the
    costal process or costal element. \n\nIt arises from the side of the body, is
    directed laterally in front of the foramen, and ends in a tubercle, the anterior
    tubercle.\n\nThe posterior part, the true transverse process, springs from the
    vertebral arch behind the foramen and is directed forward and laterally; it ends
    in a flattened vertical tubercle, the posterior tubercle.\n\nThe anterior tubercle
    of the sixth cervical vertebra is known as the carotid tubercle or Chassaignac
    tubercle (for \xC9douard Chassaignac). \n\nThis separates the carotid artery
    from the vertebral artery and the carotid artery can be massaged against this
    tubercle to relieve the symptoms of supraventricular tachycardia. \n\nThe carotid
    tubercle is also used as a landmark for anaesthesia of the brachial plexus and
    cervical plexus.\n\nThe cervical spinal nerves emerge from above the cervical
    vertebrae. \n\nFor example, the cervical spinal nerve 3 (C3) passes above C3.\n\n\n===
    Atlas and axis ===\n\nThe atlas (C1) and axis (C2) are the two topmost vertebrae.\n\nThe
    atlas (C1) is the topmost vertebra, and along with the axis forms the joint connecting
    the skull and spine. \n\nIt lacks a vertebral body, spinous process, and discs
    either superior or inferior to it. \n\nIt is ring-like and consists of an anterior
    arch, posterior arch, and two lateral masses.\nThe axis (C2) forms the pivot
    on which the atlas rotates. \n\nThe most distinctive characteristic of this bone
    is the strong odontoid process (dens) that rises perpendicularly from the upper
    surface of the body and articulates with C1. \n\nThe body is deeper in front
    than behind, and prolonged downward anteriorly so as to overlap the upper and
    front part of the third vertebra.\n\n\n=== Vertebra prominens ===\n\nThe vertebra
    prominens, or C7, has a distinctive long and prominent spinous process, which
    is palpable from the skin surface. \n\nSometimes, the seventh cervical vertebra
    is associated with an abnormal extra rib, known as a cervical rib, which develops
    from the anterior root of the transverse process. \n\nThese ribs are usually
    small, but may occasionally compress blood vessels (such as the subclavian artery
    or subclavian vein) or nerves in the brachial plexus, causing pain, numbness,
    tingling, and weakness in the upper limb, a condition known as thoracic outlet
    syndrome. \n\nVery rarely, this rib occurs in a pair.\nThe long spinous process
    of C7 is thick and nearly horizontal in direction. \n\nIt is not bifurcated,
    and ends in a tubercle that the ligamentum nuchae attaches to. \n\nThis process
    is not always the most prominent of the spinous processes, being found only about
    70% of the time, C6 or T1 can sometimes be the most prominent.\n\nThe transverse
    processes are of considerable size; their posterior roots are large and prominent,
    while the anterior are small and faintly marked. \n\nThe upper surface of each
    usually has a shallow sulcus for the eighth spinal nerve, and its extremity seldom
    presents more than a trace of bifurcation.\n\nThe transverse foramen may be as
    large as that in the other cervical vertebrae, but it is generally smaller on
    one or both sides; occasionally, it is double, and sometimes it is absent.\n\nOn
    the left side, it occasionally gives passage to the vertebral artery; more frequently,
    the vertebral vein traverses it on both sides, but the usual arrangement is for
    both artery and vein to pass in front of the transverse process, not through
    the foramen.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\nThe movement of nodding the head takes place
    predominantly through flexion and extension at the atlanto-occipital joint between
    the atlas and the occipital bone. \n\nHowever, the cervical spine is comparatively
    mobile, and some component of this movement is due to flexion and extension of
    the vertebral column itself. \n\nThis movement between the atlas and occipital
    bone is often referred to as the \"yes joint\", owing to its nature of being
    able to move the head in an up-and-down fashion.\n\nThe movement of shaking or
    rotating the head left and right happens almost entirely at the joint between
    the atlas and the axis, the atlanto-axial joint. \n\nA small amount of rotation
    of the vertebral column itself contributes to the movement. \n\nThis movement
    between the atlas and axis is often referred to as the \"no joint\", owing to
    its nature of being able to rotate the head in a side-to-side fashion.\n\n\n==
    Clinical significance ==\n\nCervical degenerative changes arise from conditions
    such as spondylosis, stenosis of intervertebral discs, and the formation of osteophytes.
    \n\nThe changes are seen on radiographs, which are used in a grading system from
    0\u20134 ranging from no changes (0) to early with minimal development of osteophytes
    (1) to mild with definite osteophytes (2) to moderate with additional disc space
    stenosis or narrowing (3) to the stage of many large osteophytes, severe narrowing
    of the disc space, and more severe vertebral end plate sclerosis (4).Injuries
    to the cervical spine are common at the level of the second cervical vertebrae,
    but neurological injury is uncommon. \n\nC4 and C5 are the areas that see the
    highest amount of cervical spine trauma.If it does occur, however, it may cause
    death or profound disability, including paralysis of the arms, legs, and diaphragm,
    which leads to respiratory failure.\n\nCommon patterns of injury include the
    odontoid fracture and the hangman's fracture, both of which are often treated
    with immobilization in a cervical collar or Halo brace.\n\nA common practice
    is to immobilize a patient's cervical spine to prevent further damage during
    transport to hospital. \n\nThis practice has come under review recently as incidence
    rates of unstable spinal trauma can be as low as 2% in immobilized patients.
    \n\nIn clearing the cervical spine, Canadian studies have developed the Canadian
    C-Spine Rule (CCR) for physicians to decide who should receive radiological imaging.\n\n\n===
    Landmarks ===\n\nThe vertebral column is often used as a marker of human anatomy.
    \n\nThis includes:\n\nAt C1, base of the nose and the hard palate\nAt C2, the
    teeth of a closed mouth\nAt C3, the mandible and hyoid bone\nAt C4, the common
    carotid artery bifurcates.\nFrom C4\u20135, the thyroid cartilage\nFrom C6\u20137,
    the cricoid cartilage\nAt C6, the oesophagus becomes continuous with the laryngopharynx
    and also where the larynx becomes continuous with the trachea. \n\nIt is also
    the level where the carotid pulse can be palpated against the transverse process
    of the C6 vertebrae.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_vertebrae"

  descriptionText: "\n\nINFERIOR NASAL CONCHA\n\n\nThe inferior nasal concha (inferior
    turbinated bone or inferior turbinal/turbinate) is one of the three paired nasal
    conchae in the nose. \n\nIt extends horizontally along the lateral wall of the
    nasal cavity and consists of a lamina of spongy bone, curled upon itself like
    a scroll, (turbinate meaning inverted cone). \n\nThe inferior nasal conchae are
    considered a pair of facial bones. \n\nAs the air passes through the turbinates,
    the air is churned against these mucosa-lined bones in order to receive warmth,
    moisture and cleansing. \n\nSuperior to inferior nasal concha are the middle
    nasal concha and superior nasal concha which both arise from the ethmoid bone,
    of the cranial portion of the skull. \n\nHence, these two are considered as a
    part of the cranial bones.\nIt has two surfaces, two borders, and two extremities.\n\n\n==
    Structure ==\n\n=== Surfaces ===\n\nThe medial surface is convex, perforated
    by numerous apertures, and traversed by longitudinal grooves for the lodgement
    of vessels.\n\nThe lateral surface is concave, and forms part of the inferior
    meatus.\n\n\n=== Borders ===\n\nIts upper border is thin, irregular, and connected
    to various bones along the lateral wall of the nasal cavity.\nIt may be divided
    into three portions: of these,\n\nthe anterior articulates with the conchal crest
    of the maxilla;\nthe posterior with the conchal crest of the palatine;\nthe middle
    portion presents three well-marked processes, which vary much in their size and
    form.\n\nOf these, the anterior or lacrimal process is small and pointed and
    is situated at the junction of the anterior fourth with the posterior three-fourths
    of the bone: it articulates, by its apex, with the descending process of the
    lacrimal bone, and, by its margins, with the groove on the back of the frontal
    process of the maxilla, and thus assists in forming the canal for the nasolacrimal
    duct.\n\nBehind this process a broad, thin plate, the ethmoidal process, ascends
    to join the uncinate process of the ethmoid; from its lower border a thin lamina,
    the maxillary process, curves downward and lateralward; it articulates with the
    maxilla and forms a part of the medial wall of the maxillary sinus.\n\nThe inferior
    border is free, thick, and cellular in structure, more especially in the middle
    of the bone.\n\n\n=== Extremities ===\n\nBoth extremities are more or less pointed,
    the posterior being the more tapering.\n\n\n=== Development ===\n\nThe inferior
    nasal concha is ossified from a single center, which appears about the fifth
    month of fetal life in the lateral wall of the cartilaginous nasal capsule.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferior_nasal_concha"

  descriptionText: "\n\nCOSTAL CARTILAGE(S)\n\n\nThe costal cartilages are bars of
    hyaline cartilage that serve to prolong the ribs forward and contribute to the
    elasticity of the walls of the thorax. \n\nCostal cartilage is only found at
    the anterior ends of the ribs, providing medial extension.\n\n\n== Differences
    from Ribs 1-12 ==\n\nThe first seven pairs are connected with the sternum; the
    next three are each articulated with the lower border of the cartilage of the
    preceding rib; the last two have pointed extremities, which end in the wall of
    the abdomen.\n\nLike the ribs, the costal cartilages vary in their length, breadth,
    and direction. \n\nThey increase in length from the first to the seventh, then
    gradually decrease to the twelfth.\n\nTheir breadth, as well as that of the intervals
    between them, diminishes from the first to the last. \n\nThey are broad at their
    attachments to the ribs, and taper toward their sternal extremities, excepting
    the first two, which are of the same breadth throughout, and the sixth, seventh,
    and eighth, which are enlarged where their margins are in contact.\n\nThey also
    vary in direction: the first descends a little to the sternum, the second is
    horizontal, the third ascends slightly, while the others are angular, following
    the course of the ribs for a short distance, and then ascending to the sternum
    or preceding cartilage.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nEach costal cartilage presents
    two surfaces, two borders, and two extremities.\n\n\n=== Surfaces ===\n\nThe
    anterior surface is convex, and looks forward and upward: that of the first gives
    attachment to the costoclavicular ligament and the subclavius muscle; those of
    the first six or seven at their sternal ends, to the pectoralis major. \n\nThe
    others are covered by, and give partial attachment to, some of the flat muscles
    of the abdomen.\n\nThe posterior surface is concave, and directed backward and
    downward; that of the first gives attachment to the sternothyroideus, those of
    the third to the sixth inclusive to the transversus thoracis muscle, and the
    six or seven inferior ones to the transversus abdominis muscle and the diaphragm.\n\n\n===
    Borders ===\n\nOf the two borders the superior is concave, the inferior convex;
    they afford attachment to the intercostales interni: the upper border of the
    sixth gives attachment also to the pectoralis major.\n\nThe inferior borders
    of the sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth cartilages present heel-like projections
    at the points of greatest convexity. \n\nThese projections carry smooth oblong
    facets which articulate with facets on slight projections from the upper borders
    of the seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth cartilages, respectively.\n\n\n=== Interchondral
    articulations ===\n\nThe interchondral articulations are the joints formed between
    the costal cartilages of the ribs. \n\nThe contiguous borders of the sixth, seventh,
    and eighth, and sometimes those of the ninth and tenth, costal cartilages articulate
    with each other by small, smooth, oblong facets. \n\nEach articulation is enclosed
    in a thin articular capsule, lined by synovial membrane and strengthened laterally
    and medially by ligamentous fibers (interchondral ligaments) which pass from
    one cartilage to the other. \n\nSometimes the fifth costal cartilages, more rarely
    the ninth and tenth, articulate by their lower borders with the adjoining cartilages
    by small oval facets; more frequently the connection is by a few ligamentous
    fibers.\n\n\n=== Extremities ===\n\nThe lateral end of each cartilage is continuous
    with the osseous tissue of the rib to which it belongs.\n\nThe medial end of
    the first is continuous with the sternum; the medial ends of the six succeeding
    ones are rounded and are received into shallow concavities on the lateral margins
    of the sternum.\n\nThe medial ends of the eighth, ninth, and tenth costal cartilages
    are pointed, and are connected each with the cartilage immediately above.\n\nThose
    of the eleventh and twelfth are pointed and free.\n\n\n== Clinical significance
    ==\n\nIn old age, the costal cartilages are prone to superficial ossification.In
    costochondritis and Tietze syndrome, inflammation of the costal cartilage occurs.
    \n\nThis is a common cause of chest pain.Severe trauma may lead to fracture of
    the costal cartilage. \n\nSuch injuries often go unnoticed during x-ray scans,
    but can be diagnosed with CT scans. \n\nSurgery is typically used to fix the
    costal cartilage back onto either the rib or sternum.Costal cartilage may be
    harvested for reparative use elsewhere in the body. \n\nWhilst this is typically
    conducted using a general anaesthetic, IV sedation can also be used. \n\nThe
    procedure presents a minor risk of pleural tear.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costal_cartilage"

  descriptionText: "\n\nMOLAR (TOOTH)\n\n\nThe molars or molar teeth are large, flat
    teeth at the back of the mouth. \n\nThey are more developed in mammals. \n\nThey
    are used primarily to grind food during chewing. \n\nThe name molar derives from
    Latin, molaris dens, meaning \"millstone tooth\", from mola, millstone and dens,
    tooth. \n\nMolars show a great deal of diversity in size and shape across mammal
    groups. \n\nThe third molar of humans is sometimes vestigial.\n\n\n== Human anatomy
    ==\n\n\nIn humans, the molar teeth have either four or five cusps. \n\nAdult
    humans have 12 molars, in four groups of three at the back of the mouth. \n\nThe
    third, rearmost molar in each group is called a wisdom tooth. \n\nIt is the last
    tooth to appear, breaking through the front of the gum at about the age of 20,
    although this varies from individual to individual. \n\nRace can also affect
    the age at which this occurs, with statistical variations between groups. \n\nIn
    some cases, it may not even erupt at all.\nThe human mouth contains upper (maxillary)
    and lower (mandibular) molars. \n\nThey are: maxillary first molar, maxillary
    second molar, maxillary third molar, mandibular first molar, mandibular second
    molar, and mandibular third molar.\n\n\n== Mammal evolution ==\n\n\nIn mammals,
    the crown of the molars and premolars is folded into a wide range of complex
    shapes. \n\nThe basic elements of the crown are the more or less conical projections
    called cusps and the valleys that separate them. \n\nThe cusps contain both dentine
    and enamel, whereas minor projections on the crown, called crenulations, are
    the result of different enamel thickness. \n\nCusps are occasionally joined to
    form ridges and expanded to form crests. \n\nCingula are often incomplete ridges
    that pass around the base of the crown.Mammalian, multicusped cheek teeth probably
    evolved from single-cusped teeth in synapsids, although the diversity of therapsid
    molar patterns and the complexity in the molars of the earliest mammals make
    determining how this happened impossible. \n\nAccording to the widely accepted
    \"differentiation theory\", additional cusps have arisen by budding or outgrowth
    from the crown, while the rivalling \"concrescence theory\" instead proposes
    that complex teeth evolved by the clustering of originally separate conical teeth.
    \n\nTherian mammals (placentals and marsupials) are generally agreed to have
    evolved from an ancestor with tribosphenic cheek teeth, with three main cusps
    arranged in a triangle.\n\n\n== Morphology ==\n\n\nEach major cusp on an upper
    molar is called a cone and is identified by a prefix dependent on its relative
    location on the tooth: proto-, para-, meta-, hypo-, and ento-. \n\nSuffixes are
    added to these names: -id is added to cusps on a lower molar (e.g., protoconid);
    -ule to a minor cusp (e.g., protoconulid). \n\nA shelf-like ridge on the lower
    part of the crown (on an upper molar) is called a cingulum; the same feature
    on the lower molar a cingulid, and a minor cusp on these, for example, a cingular
    cuspule or conulid.\n\n\n=== Tribosphenic ===\n\n\nThe design that is considered
    one of the most important characteristics of mammals is a three-cusped shape
    called a tribosphenic molar. \n\nThis molar design has two important features:
    the trigonid, or shearing end, and the talonid, or crushing heel. \n\nIn modern
    tribosphenic molars, the trigonid is towards the front of the jaw and the talonid
    is towards the rear.\n\nThe tribosphenic tooth is found in insectivores and young
    platypuses (adults have no teeth). \n\nUpper molars look like three-pointed mountain
    ranges; lowers look like two peaks and a third off to the side.\nThe tribosphenic
    design appears primitively in all groups of mammals. \n\nSome paleontologists
    believe that it developed independently in monotremes (or australosphenidans),
    rather than being inherited from an ancestor that they share with marsupials
    and placentals (or boreosphenidans); but this idea has critics and the debate
    is still going on. \n\nFor example, the dentition of the Early Cretaceous monotreme
    Steropodon is similar to those of Peramus and dryolestoids, which suggests that
    monotremes are related to some pre-tribosphenic therian mammals, but, on the
    other hand, the status of neither of these two groups is well-established.\n\nSome
    Jurassic mammals, such as Shuotherium and Pseudotribos, have \"reversed tribosphenic\"
    molars, in which the talonid is towards the front. \n\nThis variant is regarded
    as an example of convergent evolution.From the primitive tribosphenic tooth,
    molars have diversified into several unique morphologies. \n\nIn many groups,
    a fourth cusp, the hypocone (hypoconid), subsequently evolved (see below).\n\n\n===
    Quadrate ===\n\n\nQuadrate (also called quadritubercular or euthemorphic) molars
    have an additional fourth cusp on the lingual (tongue) side called the hypocone,
    located posterior to the protocone. \n\nQuadrate molars appeared early in mammal
    evolution and are present in many species, including hedgehogs, raccoons, and
    many primates, including humans.\n\nThere may be a fifth cusp.\n\nIn many mammals,
    additional smaller cusps called conules appear between the larger cusps. \n\nThey
    are named after their locations, e.g. a paraconule is located between a paracone
    and a metacone, a hypoconulid is located between a hypoconid and an entoconid.\n\n\n===
    Bunodont ===\n\n\nIn bunodont molars, the cusps are low and rounded hills rather
    than sharp peaks. \n\nThey are most common among omnivores such as pigs, bears,
    and humans. \n\nBunodont molars are effective crushing devices and often basically
    quadrate in shape.\n\n\n=== Hypsodont ===\n\nHypsodont dentition is characterized
    by high-crowned teeth and enamel that extends far past the gum line, which provides
    extra material for wear and tear. \n\nSome examples of animals with hypsodont
    dentition are cattle and horses, all animals that feed on gritty, fibrous material.
    \n\nHypsodont molars can continue to grow throughout life, for example in some
    species of Arvicolinae (herbivorous rodents).Hypsodont molars lack both a crown
    and a neck. \n\nThe occlusal surface is rough and mostly flat, adapted for crushing
    and grinding plant material. \n\nThe body is covered with cementum both above
    and below the gingival line, below which is a layer of enamel covering the entire
    length of the body. \n\nThe cementum and the enamel invaginate into the thick
    layer of dentin.\n\n\n=== Brachydont ===\n\nThe opposite condition to hypsodont
    is called brachydont or brachyodont (from brachys 'short'). \n\nIt is a type
    of dentition characterized by low-crowned teeth. \n\nHuman teeth are brachydont.A
    brachydont tooth has a crown above the gingival line and a neck just below it,
    and at least one root. \n\nA cap of enamel covers the crown and extends down
    to the neck. \n\nCementum is only found below the gingival line. \n\nThe occlusal
    surfaces tend to be pointed, well-suited for holding prey and tearing and shredding.\n\n\n===
    Zalambdodont ===\n\nZalambdodont molars have three cusps, one larger on the lingual
    side and two smaller on the labial side, joined by two crests that form a V-
    or \u03BB-shape. \n\nThe larger inner cusp might be homologous with the paracone
    in a tribosphenic molar, but can also be fused with the metacone. \n\nThe protocone
    is typically missing. \n\nThe two smaller labial cusps are located on an expanded
    shelf called the stylar shelf. \n\nZalambdodont molars are found in, for example,
    golden moles and solenodons.\n\n\n=== Dilambdodont ===\n\nLike zalambdodont molars,
    dilambdodont molars have a distinct ectoloph, but are shaped like two lambdas
    or a W. \n\nOn the lingual side, at the bottom of the W, are the metacone and
    paracone, and the stylar shelf is on the labial side. \n\nA protocone is present
    lingual to the ectoloph. \n\nDilambdodont molars are present in shrews, moles,
    and some insectivorous bats.\n\n\n=== Lophodont ===\n\n\nLophodont teeth are
    easily identified by the differentiating patterns of ridges or lophs of enamel
    interconnecting the cusps on the crowns. \n\nPresent in most herbivores, these
    patterns of lophs can be a simple, ring-like edge, as in mole rats, or a complex
    arrangement of series of ridges and cross-ridges, as those in odd-toed ungulates,
    such as equids.Lophodont molars have hard and elongated enamel ridges called
    lophs oriented either along or perpendicular to the dental row. \n\nLophodont
    molars are common in herbivores that grind their food thoroughly. \n\nExamples
    include tapirs, manatees, and many rodents.When two lophs form transverse, often
    ring-shaped, ridges on a tooth, the arrangement is called bilophodont. \n\nThis
    pattern is common in primates, but can also be found in lagomorphs (hares, rabbits,
    and pikas) and some rodents.\n\nExtreme forms of lophodonty in elephants and
    some rodents (such as Otomys) is known as loxodonty. \n\nThe African elephant
    belongs to a genus called Loxodonta because of this feature.\n\n\n=== Selenodont
    ===\n\nIn selenodont molars (so-named after moon goddess Selene), the major cusp
    is elongated into crescent-shaped ridge. \n\nExamples include most even-toed
    ungulates, such as cattle and deer.\n\n\n=== Secodont ===\n\n\nMany carnivorous
    mammals have enlarged and blade-like teeth especially adapted for slicing and
    chopping called carnassials. \n\nA general term for such blade-like teeth is
    secodont or plagiaulacoid.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_(tooth)"

  descriptionText: "\n\nLACRIMAL BONE\n\n\nThe lacrimal bone is a small and fragile
    bone of the facial skeleton; it is roughly the size of the little fingernail.
    \n\nIt is situated at the front part of the medial wall of the orbit. \n\nIt
    has two surfaces and four borders. \n\nSeveral bony landmarks of the lacrimal
    bone function in the process of lacrimation or crying. \n\nSpecifically, the
    lacrimal bone helps form the nasolacrimal canal necessary for tear translocation.
    \n\nA depression on the anterior inferior portion of the bone, the lacrimal fossa,
    houses the membranous lacrimal sac. \n\nTears or lacrimal fluid, from the lacrimal
    glands, collect in this sac during excessive lacrimation. \n\nThe fluid then
    flows through the nasolacrimal duct and into the nasopharynx. \n\nThis drainage
    results in what is commonly referred to a runny nose during excessive crying
    or tear production. \n\nInjury or fracture of the lacrimal bone can result in
    posttraumatic obstruction of the lacrimal pathways.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\n===
    Lateral or orbital surface ===\n\nThe lateral or orbital surface is divided by
    a vertical ridge, the posterior lacrimal crest, into two parts.\nIn front of
    this crest is a longitudinal groove, the lacrimal sulcus (sulcus lacrimalis),
    the inner margin of which unites with the frontal process of the maxilla, and
    the lacrimal fossa is thus completed. \n\nThe upper part of this fossa lodges
    the lacrimal sac, the lower part, the nasolacrimal duct.\nThe portion behind
    the crest is smooth, and forms part of the medial wall of the orbit.\nThe crest,
    with a part of the orbital surface immediately behind it, gives origin to the
    lacrimal part of the orbicularis oculi and ends below in a small, hook-like projection,
    the lacrimal hamulus, which articulates with the lacrimal tubercle of the maxilla,
    and completes the upper orifice of the nasolacrimal canal; the hamulus sometimes
    exists as a separate piece, and is then called the lesser lacrimal bone.\n\n\n===
    Medial or nasal surface ===\n\nThe medial or nasal surface presents a longitudinal
    furrow, corresponding to the crest on the lateral surface.\nThe area in front
    of this furrow forms part of the middle meatus of the nose. \n\nThe area behind
    it articulates with the ethmoid, and completes some of the anterior ethmoidal
    cells.\n\n\n=== Borders ===\n\nOf the four borders:\n\nthe anterior articulates
    with the frontal process of the maxilla;\nthe posterior with the lamina papyracea
    of the ethmoid;\nthe superior with the frontal bone.\nThe inferior is divided
    by the lower edge of the posterior lacrimal crest into two parts:\nthe posterior
    part articulates with the orbital plate of the maxilla;\nthe anterior is prolonged
    downward as the descending process, which articulates with the lacrimal process
    of the inferior nasal concha, and assists in forming the canal for the nasolacrimal
    duct.\n\n\n=== Development ===\n\nThe lacrimal is ossified from a single center,
    which appears about the twelfth week in the membrane covering the cartilaginous
    nasal capsule.\n\n\n=== Articulations ===\n\nThe lacrimal articulates with four
    bones: two of the cranium, the frontal and ethmoid, and two of the face, the
    maxilla and the inferior nasal concha.\n\n\n== Other animals ==\n\nIn early lobe-finned
    fishes and ancestral tetrapods, the lacrimal bone is a relatively large and robust
    bone, running from the orbit to the nostrils. \n\nIt forms part of the side of
    the face, between the nasal bones and the maxilla. \n\nIn primitive forms, it
    is often accompanied by a much smaller septomaxilla bone, lying immediately behind
    the nasal opening, but this is lost in most modern species. \n\nThe lacrimal
    bone is often smaller in living vertebrates, and is no longer always directly
    associated with the nasal opening, although it retains its connection with the
    orbit. \n\nThe bone is entirely absent in living amphibians, as well as some
    reptilian species.\n\n\n=== Dinosaurs ===\n\nIn dinosaurs, the lacrimal bone
    usually defines the anterior rim of the orbit (eye socket), and the posterior
    rim of the antorbital fenestra. \n\nIn some theropods (e.g. \n\nAllosaurus, Ceratosaurus,
    Albertosaurus) the upper part of the lacrimal bone grew in such a manner as to
    form a horn on the top of the dinosaur's head, usually situated above, and anterior
    to the eye. \n\nIn many dinosaurs, the lacrimal bone comes into contact with
    the nasal bone, the jugal bone, the prefrontal bone, and the maxillary and premaxillary
    bones. \n\nThe boundaries where some of these bones meet with the others are
    called sutures. \n\nRarely, the lacrimal bones fused with the nasal bones to
    form a pair of \"nasolacrimal\" crests, which are present in dinosaurs such as
    Dilophosaurus, Megapnosaurus and Sinosaurus.\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lacrimal_bone"

  descriptionText: "\n\nMETATARSAL BONES\n\n\nThe metatarsal bones, or metatarsus
    are a group of five long bones in the foot, located between the tarsal bones
    of the hind- and mid-foot and the phalanges of the toes. \n\nLacking individual
    names, the metatarsal bones are numbered from the medial side (the side of the
    great toe): the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth metatarsal (often depicted
    with Roman numerals). \n\nThe metatarsals are analogous to the metacarpal bones
    of the hand. \n\nThe lengths of the metatarsal bones in humans are, in descending
    order: second, third, fourth, fifth and first.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe five
    metatarsals are dorsally convex long bones consisting of a shaft or body, a base
    (proximally), and a head (distally). \n\nThe body is prismoid in form, tapers
    gradually from the tarsal to the phalangeal extremity, and is curved longitudinally,
    so as to be concave below, slightly convex above. \n\nThe base or posterior extremity
    is wedge-shaped, articulating proximally with the tarsal bones, and by its sides
    with the contiguous metatarsal bones: its dorsal and plantar surfaces are rough
    for the attachment of ligaments. \n\nThe head or distal extremity presents a
    convex articular surface, oblong from above downward, and extending farther backward
    below than above. \n\nIts sides are flattened, and on each is a depression, surmounted
    by a tubercle, for ligamentous attachment. \n\nIts plantar surface is grooved
    antero-posteriorly for the passage of the flexor tendons, and marked on either
    side by an articular eminence continuous with the terminal articular surface.\n\nDuring
    growth, the growth plates are located distally on the metatarsals, except on
    the first metatarsal where it is located proximally. \n\nYet it is quite common
    to have an accessory growth plate on the distal first metatarsal.\n\n\n=== Articulations
    ===\n\n\nThe base of each metatarsal bone articulates with one or more of the
    tarsal bones at the tarsometatarsal joints, and the head with one of the first
    row of phalanges at the metatarsophalangeal joints. \n\nTheir bases also articulate
    with each other at the intermetatarsal joints\n\n-The first metatarsal articulates
    with the medial cuneiform, and to a small extent to the intermediate cuneiform.\n-the
    second with all three cuneiforms.\n-the third with the lateral cuneiform.\n-the
    fourth with the lateral cuneiform and the cuboid.\n-The fifth with the cuboid.\n\n\n==
    Clinical significance ==\n\n=== Injuries ===\n\nThe metatarsal bones are often
    broken by association football players. \n\nThese and other recent cases have
    been attributed to the lightweight design of modern football boots, which provide
    less protection to the foot. \n\nIn 2010 some soccer players began testing a
    new sock that incorporated a rubber silicone pad over the foot to provide protection
    to the top of the foot. \n\nStress fractures are thought to account for 16% of
    injuries related to sports participation, and the metatarsals are the bones most
    often involved. \n\nThese fractures are sometimes called march fractures, based
    on their traditional association with military recruits after long marches. \n\nThe
    second and third metatarsals are fixed while walking, thus these metatarsals
    are common sites of injury. \n\nThe fifth metatarsal may be fractured if the
    foot is oversupinated during locomotion.Protection from injuries can be given
    by the use of safety footwear which can use built-in or removable metatarsal
    guards.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metatarsal_bones"

    turbinated bone or inferior turbinal/turbinate) is one of the three paired nasal
    conchae in the nose. \n\nIt extends horizontally along the lateral wall of the
    nasal cavity and consists of a lamina of spongy bone, curled upon itself like
    a scroll, (turbinate meaning inverted cone). \n\nThe inferior nasal conchae are
    considered a pair of facial bones. \n\nAs the air passes through the turbinates,
    the air is churned against these mucosa-lined bones in order to receive warmth,
    moisture and cleansing. \n\nSuperior to inferior nasal concha are the middle
    nasal concha and superior nasal concha which both arise from the ethmoid bone,
    of the cranial portion of the skull. \n\nHence, these two are considered as a
    part of the cranial bones.\nIt has two surfaces, two borders, and two extremities.\n\n\n==
    Structure ==\n\n=== Surfaces ===\n\nThe medial surface is convex, perforated
    by numerous apertures, and traversed by longitudinal grooves for the lodgement
    of vessels.\n\nThe lateral surface is concave, and forms part of the inferior
    meatus.\n\n\n=== Borders ===\n\nIts upper border is thin, irregular, and connected
    to various bones along the lateral wall of the nasal cavity.\nIt may be divided
    into three portions: of these,\n\nthe anterior articulates with the conchal crest
    of the maxilla;\nthe posterior with the conchal crest of the palatine;\nthe middle
    portion presents three well-marked processes, which vary much in their size and
    form.\n\nOf these, the anterior or lacrimal process is small and pointed and
    is situated at the junction of the anterior fourth with the posterior three-fourths
    of the bone: it articulates, by its apex, with the descending process of the
    lacrimal bone, and, by its margins, with the groove on the back of the frontal
    process of the maxilla, and thus assists in forming the canal for the nasolacrimal
    duct.\n\nBehind this process a broad, thin plate, the ethmoidal process, ascends
    to join the uncinate process of the ethmoid; from its lower border a thin lamina,
    the maxillary process, curves downward and lateralward; it articulates with the
    maxilla and forms a part of the medial wall of the maxillary sinus.\n\nThe inferior
    border is free, thick, and cellular in structure, more especially in the middle
    of the bone.\n\n\n=== Extremities ===\n\nBoth extremities are more or less pointed,
    the posterior being the more tapering.\n\n\n=== Development ===\n\nThe inferior
    nasal concha is ossified from a single center, which appears about the fifth
    month of fetal life in the lateral wall of the cartilaginous nasal capsule.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferior_nasal_concha"

  descriptionText: "\n\nPARIETAL BONE\n\nThe parietal bones are two bones in the
    skull which, when joined together at a fibrous joint, form the sides and roof
    of the cranium. \n\nIn humans, each bone is roughly quadrilateral in form, and
    has two surfaces, four borders, and four angles. \n\nIt is named from the Latin
    paries (-ietis), wall. \n\n    EXTERNAL SURFACE:\n\nThe external surface [Fig.
    1] is convex, smooth, and marked near the center by an eminence, the parietal
    eminence (tuber parietale), which indicates the point where ossification commenced.\n\nCrossing
    the middle of the bone in an arched direction are two curved lines, the superior
    and inferior temporal lines; the former gives attachment to the temporal fascia,
    and the latter indicates the upper limit of the muscular origin of the temporal
    muscle.\n\nAbove these lines the bone is covered by a tough layer of fibrous
    tissue \u2013 the epicranial aponeurosis; below them it forms part of the temporal
    fossa, and affords attachment to the temporal muscle.\n\nAt the back part and
    close to the upper or sagittal border is the parietal foramen which transmits
    a vein to the superior sagittal sinus, and sometimes a small branch of the occipital
    artery; it is not constantly present, and its size varies considerably.\n\n   
    INTERNAL SURFACE:\n\nThe internal surface is concave; it presents depressions
    corresponding to the cerebral convolutions, and numerous furrows (grooves) for
    the ramifications of the middle meningeal artery; the latter run upward and backward
    from the sphenoidal angle, and from the central and posterior part of the squamous
    border.\n\nAlong the upper margin is a shallow groove, which, together with that
    on the opposite parietal, forms a channel, the sagittal sulcus, for the superior
    sagittal sinus; the edges of the sulcus afford attachment to the falx cerebri.\n\nNear
    the groove are several depressions, best marked in the skulls of old persons,
    for the arachnoid granulations (Pacchionian bodies).\n\nIn the groove is the
    internal opening of the parietal foramen when that aperture exists. \n\n    BORDERS:\n\n   
    -The sagittal border, the longest and thickest, is dentated (has toothlike projections)
    and articulates with its fellow of the opposite side, forming the sagittal suture.\n   
    \n    -The frontal border is deeply serrated, and bevelled at the expense of
    the outer surface above and of the inner below; it articulates with the frontal
    bone, forming half of the coronal suture. The point where the coronal suture
    intersects with the sagittal suture forms a T-shape and is called the bregma.\n   
    \n    -The squamous border is divided into three parts: of these:\n        -the
    anterior is thin and pointed, bevelled at the expense of the outer surface, and
    overlapped by the tip of the great wing of the sphenoid;\n        -the middle
    portion is arched, bevelled at the expense of the outer surface, and overlapped
    by the squama of the temporal;\n        -the posterior part is thick and serrated
    for articulation with the mastoid portion of the temporal.\n    \n    -The occipital
    border, deeply denticulated (finely toothed), articulates with the occipital
    bone, forming half of the lambdoid suture. \n    \n    That point where the sagittal
    suture intersects the lambdoid suture is called the lambda, because of its resemblance
    to the Greek letter.\n    \n    \n    \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parietal_bone"

  descriptionText: "\n\nNINTH RIB\n\n\n== Structure of the rib cage ==\n\nRibs are
    described based on their location and connection with the sternum. \n\nAll ribs
    are attached posteriorly to the thoracic vertebrae and are numbered accordingly
    one to twelve. \n\nRibs that articulate directly with the sternum are called
    true ribs, whereas those that do not articulate directly are termed false ribs.
    \n\n\n=== Attachment of the rib cage ===\n\nThe terms true ribs and false ribs
    describe rib pairs that are directly or indirectly attached to the sternum. \n\nThe
    first seven rib pairs known as the fixed or vertebrosternal ribs are the true
    ribs (Latin: costae verae) as they connect directly to the sternum; the next
    five pairs (eighth to twelfth) are the false ribs (Latin: costae spuriae). \n\n\n===
    Parts of rib (general) ===\n\nEach rib consists of a head, neck, and a shaft.
    \n\nAll ribs are attached posteriorly to the thoracic vertebrae. \n\nThey are
    numbered to match the vertebrae they attach to \u2013 one to twelve, from top
    (T1) to bottom. \n\nThe head of the rib is the end part closest to the vertebra
    with which it articulates. \n\nIt is marked by a kidney-shaped articular surface
    which is divided by a horizontal crest into two articulating regions. \n\nThe
    upper region articulates with the inferior costal facet on the vertebra above,
    and the larger region articulates with the superior costal facet on the vertebra
    with the same number. \n\nThe transverse process of a thoracic vertebra also
    articulates at the transverse costal facet with the tubercle of the rib of the
    same number. \n\nThe crest gives attachment to the intra-articular ligament.The
    neck of the rib is the flattened part that extends laterally from the head. \n\nThe
    neck is about 3 cm long. \n\nIts anterior surface is flat and smooth, whilst
    its posterior is perforated by numerous foramina and its surface rough, to give
    attachment to the ligament of the neck. \n\nIts upper border presents a rough
    crest (crista colli costae) for the attachment of the anterior costotransverse
    ligament; its lower border is rounded.\n\nOn the posterior surface at the neck,
    is an eminence\u2014the tubercle that consists of an articular and a non-articular
    portion. \n\nThe articular portion is the lower and more medial of the two and
    presents a small, oval surface for articulation with the transverse costal facet
    on the end of the transverse process of the lower of the two vertebrae to which
    the head is connected. \n\nThe non-articular portion is a rough elevation and
    affords attachment to the ligament of the tubercle. \n\nThe tubercle is much
    more prominent in the upper ribs than in the lower ribs.\n\nThe angle of a rib
    (costal angle) may both refer to the bending part of it, and a prominent line
    in this area, a little in front of the tubercle. \n\nThis line is directed downward
    and laterally; this gives attachment to a tendon of the iliocostalis muscle.
    \n\nAt this point, the rib is bent in two directions, and at the same time twisted
    on its long axis.\n\nThe distance between the angle and the tubercle is progressively
    greater from the second to the tenth ribs. \n\nThe area between the angle and
    the tubercle is rounded, rough, and irregular, and serves for the attachment
    of the longissimus dorsi muscle.\n\n\n==== Ribs and vertebrae ====\n\nThe first
    rib (the topmost one) is the most curved and usually the shortest of all the
    ribs; it is broad and flat, its surfaces looking upward and downward, and its
    borders inward and outward.\n        \nThe head is small and rounded, and possesses
    only a single articular facet, for articulation with the body of the first thoracic
    vertebra. \n\nThe neck is narrow and rounded. \n\nThe tubercle, thick and prominent,
    is placed on the outer border. \n\nIt bears a small facet for articulation with
    the transverse costal facet on the transverse process of T1. \n\nThere is no
    angle, but at the tubercle, the rib is slightly bent, with the convexity upward,
    so that the head of the bone is directed downward. \n\nThe upper surface of the
    body is marked by two shallow grooves, separated from each other by a slight
    ridge prolonged internally into a tubercle, the scalene tubercle, for the attachment
    of the anterior scalene; the anterior groove transmits the subclavian vein, the
    posterior the subclavian artery and the lowest trunk of the brachial plexus.
    \n\nBehind the posterior groove is a rough area for the attachment of the medial
    scalene. \n\nThe under surface is smooth and without a costal groove. \n\nThe
    outer border is convex, thick, and rounded, and at its posterior part gives attachment
    to the first digitation of the serratus anterior. \n\nThe inner border is concave,
    thin, and sharp, and marked about its center by the scalene tubercle. \n\nThe
    anterior extremity is larger and thicker than that of any of the other ribs.\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rib_cage"

  descriptionText: "\n\nPARIETAL BONE\n\nThe parietal bones are two bones in the
    skull which, when joined together at a fibrous joint, form the sides and roof
    of the cranium. \n\nIn humans, each bone is roughly quadrilateral in form, and
    has two surfaces, four borders, and four angles. \n\nIt is named from the Latin
    paries (-ietis), wall. \n\n    EXTERNAL SURFACE:\n\nThe external surface [Fig.
    1] is convex, smooth, and marked near the center by an eminence, the parietal
    eminence (tuber parietale), which indicates the point where ossification commenced.\n\nCrossing
    the middle of the bone in an arched direction are two curved lines, the superior
    and inferior temporal lines; the former gives attachment to the temporal fascia,
    and the latter indicates the upper limit of the muscular origin of the temporal
    muscle.\n\nAbove these lines the bone is covered by a tough layer of fibrous
    tissue \u2013 the epicranial aponeurosis; below them it forms part of the temporal
    fossa, and affords attachment to the temporal muscle.\n\nAt the back part and
    close to the upper or sagittal border is the parietal foramen which transmits
    a vein to the superior sagittal sinus, and sometimes a small branch of the occipital
    artery; it is not constantly present, and its size varies considerably.\n\n   
    INTERNAL SURFACE:\n\nThe internal surface is concave; it presents depressions
    corresponding to the cerebral convolutions, and numerous furrows (grooves) for
    the ramifications of the middle meningeal artery; the latter run upward and backward
    from the sphenoidal angle, and from the central and posterior part of the squamous
    border.\n\nAlong the upper margin is a shallow groove, which, together with that
    on the opposite parietal, forms a channel, the sagittal sulcus, for the superior
    sagittal sinus; the edges of the sulcus afford attachment to the falx cerebri.\n\nNear
    the groove are several depressions, best marked in the skulls of old persons,
    for the arachnoid granulations (Pacchionian bodies).\n\nIn the groove is the
    internal opening of the parietal foramen when that aperture exists. \n\n    BORDERS:\n\n   
    -The sagittal border, the longest and thickest, is dentated (has toothlike projections)
    and articulates with its fellow of the opposite side, forming the sagittal suture.\n   
    \n    -The frontal border is deeply serrated, and bevelled at the expense of
    the outer surface above and of the inner below; it articulates with the frontal
    bone, forming half of the coronal suture. The point where the coronal suture
    intersects with the sagittal suture forms a T-shape and is called the bregma.\n   
    \n    -The squamous border is divided into three parts: of these:\n        -the
    anterior is thin and pointed, bevelled at the expense of the outer surface, and
    overlapped by the tip of the great wing of the sphenoid;\n        -the middle
    portion is arched, bevelled at the expense of the outer surface, and overlapped
    by the squama of the temporal;\n        -the posterior part is thick and serrated
    for articulation with the mastoid portion of the temporal.\n    \n    -The occipital
    border, deeply denticulated (finely toothed), articulates with the occipital
    bone, forming half of the lambdoid suture. \n    \n    That point where the sagittal
    suture intersects the lambdoid suture is called the lambda, because of its resemblance
    to the Greek letter.\n    \n    \n    \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parietal_bone"

  descriptionText: "\n\nMETATARSAL BONES\n\n\nThe metatarsal bones, or metatarsus
    are a group of five long bones in the foot, located between the tarsal bones
    of the hind- and mid-foot and the phalanges of the toes. \n\nLacking individual
    names, the metatarsal bones are numbered from the medial side (the side of the
    great toe): the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth metatarsal (often depicted
    with Roman numerals). \n\nThe metatarsals are analogous to the metacarpal bones
    of the hand. \n\nThe lengths of the metatarsal bones in humans are, in descending
    order: second, third, fourth, fifth and first.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe five
    metatarsals are dorsally convex long bones consisting of a shaft or body, a base
    (proximally), and a head (distally). \n\nThe body is prismoid in form, tapers
    gradually from the tarsal to the phalangeal extremity, and is curved longitudinally,
    so as to be concave below, slightly convex above. \n\nThe base or posterior extremity
    is wedge-shaped, articulating proximally with the tarsal bones, and by its sides
    with the contiguous metatarsal bones: its dorsal and plantar surfaces are rough
    for the attachment of ligaments. \n\nThe head or distal extremity presents a
    convex articular surface, oblong from above downward, and extending farther backward
    below than above. \n\nIts sides are flattened, and on each is a depression, surmounted
    by a tubercle, for ligamentous attachment. \n\nIts plantar surface is grooved
    antero-posteriorly for the passage of the flexor tendons, and marked on either
    side by an articular eminence continuous with the terminal articular surface.\n\nDuring
    growth, the growth plates are located distally on the metatarsals, except on
    the first metatarsal where it is located proximally. \n\nYet it is quite common
    to have an accessory growth plate on the distal first metatarsal.\n\n\n=== Articulations
    ===\n\n\nThe base of each metatarsal bone articulates with one or more of the
    tarsal bones at the tarsometatarsal joints, and the head with one of the first
    row of phalanges at the metatarsophalangeal joints. \n\nTheir bases also articulate
    with each other at the intermetatarsal joints\n\n-The first metatarsal articulates
    with the medial cuneiform, and to a small extent to the intermediate cuneiform.\n-the
    second with all three cuneiforms.\n-the third with the lateral cuneiform.\n-the
    fourth with the lateral cuneiform and the cuboid.\n-The fifth with the cuboid.\n\n\n==
    Clinical significance ==\n\n=== Injuries ===\n\nThe metatarsal bones are often
    broken by association football players. \n\nThese and other recent cases have
    been attributed to the lightweight design of modern football boots, which provide
    less protection to the foot. \n\nIn 2010 some soccer players began testing a
    new sock that incorporated a rubber silicone pad over the foot to provide protection
    to the top of the foot. \n\nStress fractures are thought to account for 16% of
    injuries related to sports participation, and the metatarsals are the bones most
    often involved. \n\nThese fractures are sometimes called march fractures, based
    on their traditional association with military recruits after long marches. \n\nThe
    second and third metatarsals are fixed while walking, thus these metatarsals
    are common sites of injury. \n\nThe fifth metatarsal may be fractured if the
    foot is oversupinated during locomotion.Protection from injuries can be given
    by the use of safety footwear which can use built-in or removable metatarsal
    guards.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metatarsal_bones"

  descriptionText: "\n\nHAMATE BONE\n\n\nThe hamate bone (from Latin hamatus, \"hooked\"),
    or unciform bone (from Latin uncus, \"hook\") is a bone in the human wrist readily
    distinguishable by its wedge shape and a hook-like process (\"hamulus\") projecting
    from its palmar surface.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe hamate is an irregularly
    shaped carpal bone found within the hand. \n\nThe hamate is found within the
    distal row of carpal bones, and abuts the metacarpals of the little finger and
    ring finger.\n\nAdjacent to the hamate on the ulnar side, and slightly above
    it, is the pisiform bone. \n\nAdjacent on the radial side is the capitate, and
    proximal is the lunate bone.\n\n\n=== Surfaces ===\n\nThe hamate bone has six
    surfaces:\n\nThe superior, the apex of the wedge, is narrow, convex, smooth,
    and articulates with the lunate.\n\nThe inferior articulates with the fourth
    and fifth metacarpal bones, by concave facets which are separated by a ridge.\n\nThe
    dorsal is triangular and rough for ligamentous attachment.\n\nThe palmar presents,
    at its lower and ulnar side, a curved, hook-like process, the hamulus, directed
    forward and laterally.\n\nThe medial articulates with the triangular bone by
    an oblong facet, cut obliquely from above, downward and medialward.\n\nThe lateral
    articulates with the capitate by its upper and posterior part, the remaining
    portion being rough, for the attachment of ligaments.\n\n\n=== Hook ===\n\nThe
    hook of hamate (Latin: hamulus) is found at the proximal, ulnar side of the hamate
    bone. \n\nThe hook is a curved, hook-like process that projects 1\u20132 mm distally
    and radially. \n\nThe ulnar nerve hooks around the hook of hamate as it crosses
    towards the medial side of hand. \n\nThe hook forms the ulnar border of the carpal
    tunnel, and the radial border for Guyon's canal. \n\nNumerous structures attach
    to it, including ligaments from the pisiform, the transverse carpal ligament,
    and the tendon of Flexor carpi ulnaris.\n\nIts medial surface to the flexor digiti
    minimi brevis and opponens digiti minimi; its lateral side is grooved for the
    passage of the flexor tendons into the palm of the hand.\n\n\n=== Development
    ===\n\nThe ossification of the hamate starts between 1 and 12 months. \n\nThe
    hamate does not fully ossify until about the 15th year of life.\n\n\n=== In animals
    ===\n\nThe bone is also found in many other mammals, and is homologous with the
    \"fourth distal carpal\" of reptiles and amphibians.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\nThe
    carpal bones function as a unit to provide a bony superstructure for the hand.:\u200A708\u200A\n\n\n==
    Clinical significance ==\n\nThe hamate bone is the bone most commonly fractured
    when a golfer hits the ground hard with a golf club on the downswing or a hockey
    player hits the ice with a slap shot. \n\nThe fracture is usually a hairline
    fracture, commonly missed on normal X-rays. \n\nSymptoms are pain aggravated
    by gripping, tenderness over the hamate and symptoms of irritation of the ulnar
    nerve. \n\nThis is characterized by numbness and weakness of the pinkie finger
    with partial involvement of the ring finger as well, the \"ulnar 1\xBD fingers\".\n\nThe
    hook of hamate is particularly prone to fracture-related complications such as
    non-union due to its tenuous blood supply.\n\nIt is also a common injury in baseball
    players. \n\nSeveral professional baseball players have had the bone removed
    during the course of their careers. \n\nThis condition has been called \"Wilson's
    Wrist\".\n\nThe calcification of the unciform bone is seen on X-rays during puberty
    and is sometimes used in orthodontics to determine if an adolescent patient is
    suitable for orthognathic intervention (i.e. before or at their growth spurt).\n\n\n==
    Etymology ==\n\nThe etymology derives from the Latin hamatus \"hooked,\" from
    hamus which means \"hook\".\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamate_bone"

  descriptionText: "\n\nCERVICAL VERTEBRAE\n\n\nIn tetrapods, cervical vertebrae
    (singular: vertebra) are the vertebrae of the neck, immediately below the skull.
    \n\nTruncal vertebrae (divided into thoracic and lumbar vertebrae in mammals)
    lie caudal (toward the tail) of cervical vertebrae. \n\nIn sauropsid species,
    the cervical vertebrae bear cervical ribs. \n\nIn lizards and saurischian dinosaurs,
    the cervical ribs are large; in birds, they are small and completely fused to
    the vertebrae. \n\nThe vertebral transverse processes of mammals are homologous
    to the cervical ribs of other amniotes. \n\nMost mammals have seven cervical
    vertebrae, with the only three known exceptions being the manatee with six, the
    two-toed sloth with five or six, and the three-toed sloth with nine.\n\nIn humans,
    cervical vertebrae are the smallest of the true vertebrae and can be readily
    distinguished from those of the thoracic or lumbar regions by the presence of
    a foramen (hole) in each transverse process, through which the vertebral artery,
    vertebral veins, and inferior cervical ganglion pass. \n\nThe remainder of this
    article focuses upon human anatomy.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\n\nBy convention,
    the cervical vertebrae are numbered, with the first one (C1) closest to the skull
    and higher numbered vertebrae (C2\u2013C7) proceeding away from the skull and
    down the spine.\n\nThe general characteristics of the third through sixth cervical
    vertebrae are described here. \n\nThe first, second, and seventh vertebrae are
    extraordinary, and are detailed later.\n\nThe bodies of these four vertebrae
    are small, and broader from side to side than from front to back.\n\nThe anterior
    and posterior surfaces are flattened and of equal depth; the former is placed
    on a lower level than the latter, and its inferior border is prolonged downward,
    so as to overlap the upper and forepart of the vertebra below.\n\nThe upper surface
    is concave transversely, and presents a projecting lip on either side.\n\nThe
    lower surface is concave from front to back, convex from side to side, and presents
    laterally shallow concavities that receive the corresponding projecting lips
    of the underlying vertebra.\n\nThe pedicles are directed laterally and backward,
    and attach to the body midway between its upper and lower borders, so that the
    superior vertebral notch is as deep as the inferior, but it is, at the same time,
    narrower.\n\nThe laminae are narrow and thinner above than below; the vertebral
    foramen is large and of a triangular form.\nThe spinous process is short and
    bifid, the two divisions being often of unequal size. \n\nBecause the spinous
    processes are so short, certain superficial muscles (the trapezius and splenius
    capitis) attach to the nuchal ligament rather than directly to the vertebrae;
    the nuchal ligament itself attaching to the spinous processes of C2\u2013C7 and
    to the posterior tubercle of the atlas.\n\nThe superior and inferior articular
    processes of cervical vertebrae have fused on either or both sides to form articular
    pillars, columns of bone that project laterally from the junction of the pedicle
    and lamina.\n\nThe articular facets are flat and of an oval form:\nthe superior
    face backward, upward, and slightly medially.\nthe inferior face forward, downward,
    and slightly laterally.\n\nThe transverse processes are each pierced by the foramen
    transversarium, which, in the upper six vertebrae, gives passage to the vertebral
    artery and vein, as well as a plexus of sympathetic nerves. \n\nEach process
    consists of an anterior and a posterior part. \n\nThese two parts are joined,
    outside the foramen, by a bar of bone that exhibits a deep sulcus on its upper
    surface for the passage of the corresponding spinal nerve.\n\nThe anterior portion
    is the homologue of the rib in the thoracic region, and is therefore named the
    costal process or costal element. \n\nIt arises from the side of the body, is
    directed laterally in front of the foramen, and ends in a tubercle, the anterior
    tubercle.\n\nThe posterior part, the true transverse process, springs from the
    vertebral arch behind the foramen and is directed forward and laterally; it ends
    in a flattened vertical tubercle, the posterior tubercle.\n\nThe anterior tubercle
    of the sixth cervical vertebra is known as the carotid tubercle or Chassaignac
    tubercle (for \xC9douard Chassaignac). \n\nThis separates the carotid artery
    from the vertebral artery and the carotid artery can be massaged against this
    tubercle to relieve the symptoms of supraventricular tachycardia. \n\nThe carotid
    tubercle is also used as a landmark for anaesthesia of the brachial plexus and
    cervical plexus.\n\nThe cervical spinal nerves emerge from above the cervical
    vertebrae. \n\nFor example, the cervical spinal nerve 3 (C3) passes above C3.\n\n\n===
    Atlas and axis ===\n\nThe atlas (C1) and axis (C2) are the two topmost vertebrae.\n\nThe
    atlas (C1) is the topmost vertebra, and along with the axis forms the joint connecting
    the skull and spine. \n\nIt lacks a vertebral body, spinous process, and discs
    either superior or inferior to it. \n\nIt is ring-like and consists of an anterior
    arch, posterior arch, and two lateral masses.\nThe axis (C2) forms the pivot
    on which the atlas rotates. \n\nThe most distinctive characteristic of this bone
    is the strong odontoid process (dens) that rises perpendicularly from the upper
    surface of the body and articulates with C1. \n\nThe body is deeper in front
    than behind, and prolonged downward anteriorly so as to overlap the upper and
    front part of the third vertebra.\n\n\n=== Vertebra prominens ===\n\nThe vertebra
    prominens, or C7, has a distinctive long and prominent spinous process, which
    is palpable from the skin surface. \n\nSometimes, the seventh cervical vertebra
    is associated with an abnormal extra rib, known as a cervical rib, which develops
    from the anterior root of the transverse process. \n\nThese ribs are usually
    small, but may occasionally compress blood vessels (such as the subclavian artery
    or subclavian vein) or nerves in the brachial plexus, causing pain, numbness,
    tingling, and weakness in the upper limb, a condition known as thoracic outlet
    syndrome. \n\nVery rarely, this rib occurs in a pair.\nThe long spinous process
    of C7 is thick and nearly horizontal in direction. \n\nIt is not bifurcated,
    and ends in a tubercle that the ligamentum nuchae attaches to. \n\nThis process
    is not always the most prominent of the spinous processes, being found only about
    70% of the time, C6 or T1 can sometimes be the most prominent.\n\nThe transverse
    processes are of considerable size; their posterior roots are large and prominent,
    while the anterior are small and faintly marked. \n\nThe upper surface of each
    usually has a shallow sulcus for the eighth spinal nerve, and its extremity seldom
    presents more than a trace of bifurcation.\n\nThe transverse foramen may be as
    large as that in the other cervical vertebrae, but it is generally smaller on
    one or both sides; occasionally, it is double, and sometimes it is absent.\n\nOn
    the left side, it occasionally gives passage to the vertebral artery; more frequently,
    the vertebral vein traverses it on both sides, but the usual arrangement is for
    both artery and vein to pass in front of the transverse process, not through
    the foramen.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\nThe movement of nodding the head takes place
    predominantly through flexion and extension at the atlanto-occipital joint between
    the atlas and the occipital bone. \n\nHowever, the cervical spine is comparatively
    mobile, and some component of this movement is due to flexion and extension of
    the vertebral column itself. \n\nThis movement between the atlas and occipital
    bone is often referred to as the \"yes joint\", owing to its nature of being
    able to move the head in an up-and-down fashion.\n\nThe movement of shaking or
    rotating the head left and right happens almost entirely at the joint between
    the atlas and the axis, the atlanto-axial joint. \n\nA small amount of rotation
    of the vertebral column itself contributes to the movement. \n\nThis movement
    between the atlas and axis is often referred to as the \"no joint\", owing to
    its nature of being able to rotate the head in a side-to-side fashion.\n\n\n==
    Clinical significance ==\n\nCervical degenerative changes arise from conditions
    such as spondylosis, stenosis of intervertebral discs, and the formation of osteophytes.
    \n\nThe changes are seen on radiographs, which are used in a grading system from
    0\u20134 ranging from no changes (0) to early with minimal development of osteophytes
    (1) to mild with definite osteophytes (2) to moderate with additional disc space
    stenosis or narrowing (3) to the stage of many large osteophytes, severe narrowing
    of the disc space, and more severe vertebral end plate sclerosis (4).Injuries
    to the cervical spine are common at the level of the second cervical vertebrae,
    but neurological injury is uncommon. \n\nC4 and C5 are the areas that see the
    highest amount of cervical spine trauma.If it does occur, however, it may cause
    death or profound disability, including paralysis of the arms, legs, and diaphragm,
    which leads to respiratory failure.\n\nCommon patterns of injury include the
    odontoid fracture and the hangman's fracture, both of which are often treated
    with immobilization in a cervical collar or Halo brace.\n\nA common practice
    is to immobilize a patient's cervical spine to prevent further damage during
    transport to hospital. \n\nThis practice has come under review recently as incidence
    rates of unstable spinal trauma can be as low as 2% in immobilized patients.
    \n\nIn clearing the cervical spine, Canadian studies have developed the Canadian
    C-Spine Rule (CCR) for physicians to decide who should receive radiological imaging.\n\n\n===
    Landmarks ===\n\nThe vertebral column is often used as a marker of human anatomy.
    \n\nThis includes:\n\nAt C1, base of the nose and the hard palate\nAt C2, the
    teeth of a closed mouth\nAt C3, the mandible and hyoid bone\nAt C4, the common
    carotid artery bifurcates.\nFrom C4\u20135, the thyroid cartilage\nFrom C6\u20137,
    the cricoid cartilage\nAt C6, the oesophagus becomes continuous with the laryngopharynx
    and also where the larynx becomes continuous with the trachea. \n\nIt is also
    the level where the carotid pulse can be palpated against the transverse process
    of the C6 vertebrae.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_vertebrae"

  descriptionText: "\n\nSTAPES\n\n\nThe stapes or stirrup is a bone in the middle
    ear of humans and other animals which is involved in the conduction of sound
    vibrations to the inner ear. \n\nThis bone is connected to the oval window by
    its annular ligament, which allows the footplate to transmit sound energy through
    the oval window into the inner ear. \n\nThe stapes is the smallest and lightest
    bone in the human body, and is so-called because of its resemblance to a stirrup
    (Latin: Stapes).\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\n\nThe stapes is the third bone of the
    three ossicles in the middle ear and the smallest in the human body. \n\nIt measures
    roughly 2 to 3 mm, greater along the head-base span. \n\nIt rests on the oval
    window, to which it is connected by an annular ligament and articulates with
    the incus, or anvil through the incudostapedial joint. \n\nThey are connected
    by anterior and posterior limbs (Latin: crura).:\u200A862\u200A\n\n\n=== Development
    ===\n\nThe stapes develops from the second pharyngeal arch during the sixth to
    eighth week of embryological life. \n\nThe central cavity of the stapes, the
    obturator foramen, is due to the presence embryologically of the stapedial artery,
    which usually regresses in humans during normal development.\n\n\n=== Animals
    ===\n\n\nThe stapes is one of three ossicles in mammals. \n\nIn non-mammalian
    four-legged animals, the bone homologous to the stapes is usually called the
    columella; however, in reptiles, either term may be used. \n\nIn fish, the homologous
    bone is called the hyomandibular, and is part of the gill arch supporting either
    the spiracle or the jaw, depending on the species. \n\nThe equivalent term in
    amphibians is the pars media plectra.:\u200A481\u2013482\u200A\n\n\n=== Variation
    ===\n\nThe stapes appears to be relatively constant in size in different ethnic
    groups. \n\nIn 0.01\u20130.02% of people, the stapedial artery does not regress,
    and persists in the central foramen. \n\nIn this case, a pulsatile sound may
    be heard in the affected ear, or there may be no symptoms at all. \n\nRarely,
    the stapes may be completely absent.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\n\nSituated between
    the incus and the inner ear, the stapes transmits sound vibrations from the incus
    to the oval window, a membrane-covered opening to the inner ear. \n\nThe stapes
    is also stabilized by the stapedius muscle, which is innervated by the facial
    nerve.:\u200A861\u2013863\u200A\n\n\n== Clinical relevance ==\n\nOtosclerosis
    is a congenital or spontaneous-onset disease characterized by abnormal bone remodeling
    in the inner ear. \n\nOften this causes the stapes to adhere to the oval window,
    which impedes its ability to conduct sound, and is a cause of conductive hearing
    loss. \n\nClinical otosclerosis is found in about 1% of people, although it is
    more common in forms that do not cause noticeable hearing loss. \n\nOtosclerosis
    is more likely in young age groups, and females. \n\nTwo common treatments are
    stapedectomy, the surgical removal of the stapes and replacement with an artificial
    prosthesis, and stapedotomy, the creation of a small hole in the base of the
    stapes followed by the insertion of an artificial prosthesis into that hole.\u200A
    \n\nSurgery may be complicated by a persistent stapedial artery, fibrosis-related
    damage to the base of the bone, or obliterative otosclerosis, resulting in obliteration
    of the base. :\u200A254\u2013262\u200A\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\nThe stapes is
    commonly described as having been discovered by the professor Giovanni Filippo
    Ingrassia in 1546 at the University of Naples, although this remains the nature
    of some controversy, as Ingrassia's description was published posthumously in
    his 1603 anatomical commentary In Galeni librum de ossibus doctissima et expectatissima
    commentaria. \n\nSpanish anatomist Pedro Jimeno is first to have been credited
    with a published description, in Dialogus de re medica (1549). \n\nThe bone is
    so-named because of its resemblance to a stirrup (Latin: stapes), an example
    of a late Latin word, probably created in mediaeval times from \"to stand\" (Latin:
    stapia), as stirrups did not exist in the early Latin-speaking world.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stapes"

  descriptionText: "\n\nCOCCYX\n\n\nThe coccyx (plural: coccyges or coccyxes), commonly
    referred to as the tailbone, is the final segment of the vertebral column in
    all apes, and analogous structures in certain other mammals such as horses. \n\nIn
    tailless primates (e.g. humans and other great apes) since Nacholapithecus (a
    Miocene hominoid), the coccyx is the remnant of a vestigial tail. \n\nIn animals
    with bony tails, it is known as tailhead or dock, in bird anatomy as tailfan.
    \n\nIt comprises three to five separate or fused coccygeal vertebrae below the
    sacrum, attached to the sacrum by a fibrocartilaginous joint, the sacrococcygeal
    symphysis, which permits limited movement between the sacrum and the coccyx.\n\n\n==
    Structure ==\n\n\nThe coccyx is formed of either three, four or five rudimentary
    vertebrae. \n\nIt articulates superiorly with the sacrum. \n\nIn each of the
    first three segments may be traced a rudimentary body and articular and transverse
    processes; the last piece (sometimes the third) is a mere nodule of bone. \n\nThe
    transverse processes are most prominent and noticeable on the first coccygeal
    segment. \n\nAll the segments lack pedicles, laminae and spinous processes. \n\nThe
    first is the largest; it resembles the lowest sacral vertebra, and often exists
    as a separate piece; the remaining ones diminish in size from above downward.\n\nMost
    anatomy books incorrectly state that the coccyx is normally fused in adults.
    \n\nIn fact it has been shown that the coccyx may consist of up to five separate
    bony segments, the most common configuration being two or three segments.\n\n\n===
    Surfaces ===\n\nThe anterior surface is slightly concave and marked with three
    transverse grooves that indicate the junctions of the different segments. \n\nIt
    gives attachment to the anterior sacrococcygeal ligament and the levatores ani
    and supports part of the rectum. \n\nThe posterior surface is convex, marked
    by transverse grooves similar to those on the anterior surface, and presents
    on either side a linear row of tubercles\u2013the rudimentary articular processes
    of the coccygeal vertebrae. \n\nOf these, the superior pair are the largest,
    and are called the coccygeal cornua they project upward, and articulate with
    the cornua of the sacrum, and on either side complete the foramen for the transmission
    of the posterior division of the fifth sacral nerve.\n\n\n=== Borders ===\n\nThe
    lateral borders are thin and exhibit a series of small eminences, which represent
    the transverse processes of the coccygeal vertebrae. \n\nOf these, the first
    is the largest; it is flattened from before backward, and often ascends to join
    the lower part of the thin lateral edge of the sacrum, thus completing the foramen
    for the transmission of the anterior division of the fifth sacral nerve; the
    others diminish in size from above downward, and are often wanting. \n\nThe borders
    of the coccyx are narrow, and give attachment on either side to the sacrotuberous
    and sacrospinous ligaments, to the coccygeus and levator ani in front of the
    ligaments, and to the gluteus maximus behind them.\n\n\n=== Apex ===\n\nThe apex
    is rounded, and has attached to it the tendon of the external anal sphincter.
    \n\nIt may be bifid (divided into two).\n\n\n=== Coccygeal fossa ===\n\nThe coccygeal
    fossa is a shallow depression (fossa) on the surface between the sacrum and the
    perineum, located in the intergluteal cleft that runs from just below the sacrum
    to the perineum. \n\nIt does not always appear. \n\nThe coccygeal fossa marks
    the deepest part of the pelvic floor, next to the coccyx. \n\nThe levator ani
    ascends from here.\n\n\n=== Extensor coccygis ===\n\nThe extensor coccygis is
    a slender muscle fascicle, which is not always present. \n\nIt extends over the
    lower part of the posterior surface of the sacrum and coccyx. \n\nIt arises by
    tendinous fibers from the last segment of the sacrum, or first piece of the coccyx,
    and passes downward to be inserted into the lower part of the coccyx. \n\nIt
    is a rudiment of the extensor muscle of the caudal vertebrae of other animals.\n\n\n===
    Sacrococcygeal and intercoccygeal joints ===\n\nThe joints are variable and may
    be: (1) synovial joints; (2) thin discs of fibrocartilage; (3) intermediate between
    these two; (4) ossified.\n\n\n=== Attachments ===\n\nThe anterior side of the
    coccyx has attachments to the levator ani muscle, coccygeus, iliococcygeus, and
    pubococcygeus, anococcygeal raphe. \n\nAttached to the posterior side is the
    gluteus maximus, which extends the thigh at the hip joint. \n\nThe ligaments
    attached to the coccyx include the anterior and posterior sacrococcygeal ligaments
    which are the continuations of the anterior and posterior longitudinal ligaments
    that stretches along the entire spine. \n\nThe lateral sacrococcygeal ligaments
    complete the foramina for the last sacral nerve. \n\nSome fibers of the sacrospinous
    and sacrotuberous ligaments (arising from the spine of the ischium and the ischial
    tuberosity respectively) also attach to the coccyx. \n\nAn extension of the pia
    mater, the filum terminale, extends from the apex of the conus, and inserts on
    the coccyx.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\nThe coccyx is not entirely useless in humans,
    based on the fact that the coccyx has attachments to various muscles, tendons
    and ligaments. \n\nHowever, these muscles, tendons and ligaments are also attached
    at many other points, to stronger structures than the coccyx. \n\nIt is doubtful
    that the coccyx attachments are important to the well-being of humans, given
    the large number of cases of coccygectomy for coccydynia. \n\nReviews of studies
    covering more than 700 operations found the operation was successful in relieving
    pain in 84% of cases. 12% of the time, the only major complication faced was
    infection due to the proximity to the anus. \n\nHowever, one notable issue that
    arises from its removal is an increased risk of perineal hernia.\n\n\n== Clinical
    significance ==\n\nInjuring the coccyx can give rise to a painful condition called
    coccydynia and one or more of the bones or the connections thereof may be broken,
    fractured tailbone. \n\nA number of tumors are known to involve the coccyx; of
    these, the most common is sacrococcygeal teratoma. \n\nBoth coccydynia and coccygeal
    tumors may require surgical removal of the coccyx (coccygectomy). \n\nOne very
    rare complication of coccygectomy is a type of perineal hernia known as a coccygeal
    hernia.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Etymology ===\n\nThe term coccyx is derived
    from the ancient Greek word \u03BA\u03CC\u03BA\u03BA\u03C5\u03BE kokkyx \"cuckoo\";
    the latter is attested in the writings of the Greek physician Herophilus to denote
    the end of the vertebral column. \n\nThis Greek name for the cuckoo was applied
    as the last three or four bones of the coccyx resemble the beak of this bird,
    when viewed from the side.This established etymological explanation can also
    be found in the writings of the 16th century anatomist Andreas Vesalius who wrote:
    os cuculi, a similitudine rostri cuculi avis (the cuckoo bone shows a likeness
    to the beak of the cuckoo bird). \n\nVesalius used the Latin expression os cuculi,
    with os, bone and cuculus, the Latin name for the cuckoo. \n\nThe 16th/17th century
    French anatomist Jean Riolan the Younger gives a rather hilarious etymological
    explanation, as he writes: quia crepitus, qui per sedimentum exeunt, ad is os
    allisi, cuculi vocis similitudinem effingunt (because the sound of the farts
    that leave the anus and dash against this bone, shows a likeness to the call
    of the cuckoo). \n\nThe latter is not considered as potential candidate.Besides
    os cuculi, os caudae, with caudae, of the tail is attested. \n\nThis Latin expression
    might be the source of the English, French language, German and Dutch terms tailbone,
    l'os de la queue, Schwanzbein and staartbeen. \n\nIn the current official anatomic
    Latin nomenclature, Terminologia Anatomica, coccyx and os coccygis is used.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coccyx"

  descriptionText: "\n\nCOSTAL CARTILAGE(S)\n\n\nThe costal cartilages are bars of
    hyaline cartilage that serve to prolong the ribs forward and contribute to the
    elasticity of the walls of the thorax. \n\nCostal cartilage is only found at
    the anterior ends of the ribs, providing medial extension.\n\n\n== Differences
    from Ribs 1-12 ==\n\nThe first seven pairs are connected with the sternum; the
    next three are each articulated with the lower border of the cartilage of the
    preceding rib; the last two have pointed extremities, which end in the wall of
    the abdomen.Like the ribs, the costal cartilages vary in their length, breadth,
    and direction. \n\nThey increase in length from the first to the seventh, then
    gradually decrease to the twelfth.\n\nTheir breadth, as well as that of the intervals
    between them, diminishes from the first to the last. \n\nThey are broad at their
    attachments to the ribs, and taper toward their sternal extremities, excepting
    the first two, which are of the same breadth throughout, and the sixth, seventh,
    and eighth, which are enlarged where their margins are in contact.\n\nThey also
    vary in direction: the first descends a little to the sternum, the second is
    horizontal, the third ascends slightly, while the others are angular, following
    the course of the ribs for a short distance, and then ascending to the sternum
    or preceding cartilage.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nEach costal cartilage presents
    two surfaces, two borders, and two extremities.\n\n\n=== Surfaces ===\n\nThe
    anterior surface is convex, and looks forward and upward: that of the first gives
    attachment to the costoclavicular ligament and the subclavius muscle; those of
    the first six or seven at their sternal ends, to the pectoralis major. \n\nThe
    others are covered by, and give partial attachment to, some of the flat muscles
    of the abdomen.\n\nThe posterior surface is concave, and directed backward and
    downward; that of the first gives attachment to the sternothyroideus, those of
    the third to the sixth inclusive to the transversus thoracis muscle, and the
    six or seven inferior ones to the transversus abdominis muscle and the diaphragm.\n\n\n===
    Borders ===\n\nOf the two borders the superior is concave, the inferior convex;
    they afford attachment to the intercostales interni: the upper border of the
    sixth gives attachment also to the pectoralis major.\n\nThe inferior borders
    of the sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth cartilages present heel-like projections
    at the points of greatest convexity. \n\nThese projections carry smooth oblong
    facets which articulate with facets on slight projections from the upper borders
    of the seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth cartilages, respectively.\n\n\n=== Interchondral
    articulations ===\n\nThe interchondral articulations are the joints formed between
    the costal cartilages of the ribs. \n\nThe contiguous borders of the sixth, seventh,
    and eighth, and sometimes those of the ninth and tenth, costal cartilages articulate
    with each other by small, smooth, oblong facets. \n\nEach articulation is enclosed
    in a thin articular capsule, lined by synovial membrane and strengthened laterally
    and medially by ligamentous fibers (interchondral ligaments) which pass from
    one cartilage to the other. \n\nSometimes the fifth costal cartilages, more rarely
    the ninth and tenth, articulate by their lower borders with the adjoining cartilages
    by small oval facets; more frequently the connection is by a few ligamentous
    fibers.\n\n\n=== Extremities ===\n\nThe lateral end of each cartilage is continuous
    with the osseous tissue of the rib to which it belongs.\n\nThe medial end of
    the first is continuous with the sternum; the medial ends of the six succeeding
    ones are rounded and are received into shallow concavities on the lateral margins
    of the sternum.\n\nThe medial ends of the eighth, ninth, and tenth costal cartilages
    are pointed, and are connected each with the cartilage immediately above.\n\nThose
    of the eleventh and twelfth are pointed and free.\n\n\n== Clinical significance
    ==\n\nIn old age, the costal cartilages are prone to superficial ossification.In
    costochondritis and Tietze syndrome, inflammation of the costal cartilage occurs.
    \n\nThis is a common cause of chest pain.Severe trauma may lead to fracture of
    the costal cartilage. \n\nSuch injuries often go unnoticed during x-ray scans,
    but can be diagnosed with CT scans. \n\nSurgery is typically used to fix the
    costal cartilage back onto either the rib or sternum.Costal cartilage may be
    harvested for reparative use elsewhere in the body. \n\nWhilst this is typically
    conducted using a general anaesthetic, IV sedation can also be used. \n\nThe
    procedure presents a minor risk of pleural tear.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costal_cartilage"

  descriptionText: "\n\nPHALANX\n\n\nThe phalanx (Ancient Greek: \u03C6\u03AC\u03BB\u03B1\u03B3\u03BE;
    plural phalanxes or phalanges, \u03C6\u03AC\u03BB\u03B1\u03B3\u03B3\u03B5\u03C2,
    phalanges) was a rectangular mass military formation, usually composed entirely
    of heavy infantry armed with spears, pikes, sarissas, or similar pole weapons.
    \n\nThe term is particularly used to describe the use of this formation in Ancient
    Greek warfare, although the ancient Greek writers used it to also describe any
    massed infantry formation, regardless of its equipment. \n\nArrian uses the term
    in his Array against the Alans when he refers to his legions. \n\nIn Greek texts,
    the phalanx may be deployed for battle, on the march, or even camped, thus describing
    the mass of infantry or cavalry that would deploy in line during battle. \n\nThey
    marched forward as one entity. \nThe term itself, as used today, does not refer
    to a distinctive military unit or division (e.g., the Roman legion or the contemporary
    Western-type battalion), but to the type of formation of an army's troops. \n\nTherefore,
    this term does not indicate a standard combat strength or composition but includes
    the total number of infantry, which is deployed in a single formation known as
    a \"phalanx\".\nMany spear-armed troops historically fought in what might be
    termed phalanx-like formations. \n\nThis article focuses on the use of the military
    phalanx formation in Ancient Greece, the Hellenistic world, and other ancient
    states heavily influenced by Greek civilization.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe earliest
    known depiction of a phalanx-like formation occurs in a Sumerian stele from the
    25th century BC. \n\nHere the troops seem to have been equipped with spears,
    helmets, and large shields covering the whole body. \n\nAncient Egyptian infantry
    were known to have employed similar formations. \n\nThe first usage of the term
    phalanx comes from Homer's \"\u03C6\u03B1\u03BB\u03B1\u03B3\u03BE\", used to
    describe hoplites fighting in an organized battle line. \n\nHomer used the term
    to differentiate the formation-based combat from the individual duels so often
    found in his poems.Historians have not arrived at a consensus about the relationship
    between the Greek formation and these predecessors of the hoplites. \n\nThe principles
    of shield wall and spear hedge were almost universally known among the armies
    of major civilizations throughout history, and so the similarities may be related
    to convergent evolution instead of diffusion.\nTraditionally, historians date
    the origin of the hoplite phalanx of ancient Greece to the 8th century BC in
    Sparta, but this is under revision. \n\nIt is perhaps more likely that the formation
    was devised in the 7th century BC after the introduction of the aspis by the
    city of Argos, which would have made the formation possible. \n\nThis is further
    evidenced by the Chigi vase, dated to 650 BC, identifying hoplites armed with
    aspis, spear and panoply.Another possible theory as to the birth of Greek phalanx
    warfare stems from the idea that some of the basic aspects of the phalanx were
    present in earlier times yet were not fully developed due to the lack of appropriate
    technology. \n\nTwo of the basic tactics seen in earlier warfare include the
    principle of cohesion and the use of large groups of soldiers. \n\nThis would
    suggest that the Greek phalanx was rather the culmination and perfection of a
    slowly developed idea that originated many years earlier. \n\nAs weaponry and
    armour advanced through the years in different city-states, the phalanx became
    complex and effective.\n\n\n== Overview ==\n\nThe hoplite phalanx of the Archaic
    and Classical periods in Greece (c. 800\u2013350 BC) was the formation in which
    the hoplites would line up in ranks in close order. \n\nThe hoplites would lock
    their shields together, and the first few ranks of soldiers would project their
    spears out over the first rank of shields. \n\nThe phalanx therefore presented
    a shield wall and a mass of spear points to the enemy, making frontal assaults
    against it very difficult. \n\nIt also allowed a higher proportion of the soldiers
    to be actively engaged in combat at a given time (rather than just those in the
    front rank).\nBattles between two phalanxes usually took place in open, flat
    plains where it was easier to advance and stay in formation. \n\nRough terrain
    or hilly regions would have made it difficult to maintain a steady line and would
    have defeated the purpose of a phalanx. \n\nAs a result, battles between Greek
    city-states would not take place in just any location, nor would they be limited
    to sometimes obvious strategic points. \n\nRather, many times, the two opposing
    sides would find the most suitable piece of land where the conflict could be
    settled. \n\nTypically, the battle ended with one of the two fighting forces
    fleeing to safety.The phalanx usually advanced at a walking pace, although it
    is possible that they picked up speed during the last several yards. \n\nOne
    of the main reasons for this slow approach was to maintain formation. \n\nThe
    formation would be rendered useless if the phalanx was lost as the unit approached
    the enemy and could even become detrimental to the advancing unit, resulting
    in a weaker formation that was easier for an enemy force to break through. \n\nIf
    the hoplites of the phalanx were to pick up speed toward the latter part of the
    advance, it would have been for the purpose of gaining momentum against the enemy
    in the initial collision. \n\nHerodotus states of the Greeks at the Battle of
    Marathon, that \"They were the first Greeks we know of to charge their enemy
    at a run\". \n\nMany historians believe that this innovation was precipitated
    by their desire to minimize their losses from Persian archery. \n\nThe opposing
    sides would collide, possibly severing many of the spears of the row in front
    and killing the front part of the enemy army due to the bone-breaking collision.\nThe
    spears of a phalanx had spiked butts. \n\nIn battle, the back ranks used the
    spikes to finish fallen enemy soldiers.\n\n\n=== Pushing ===\n\nThe \"physical
    pushing match\" theory is one where the battle would rely on the valour of the
    men in the front line, whilst those in the rear maintained forward pressure on
    the front ranks with their shields, and the whole formation would consistently
    press forward trying to break the enemy formation. \n\nThis is the most widely
    accepted interpretation of the ancient sources thus when two phalanx formations
    engaged, the struggle essentially became a pushing match. \n\nHistorians such
    as Victor Davis Hanson point out that it is difficult to account for exceptionally
    deep phalanx formations unless they were necessary to facilitate the physical
    pushing depicted by this theory, as those behind the first two ranks could not
    take part in the actual spear thrusting.No Greek art ever depicts anything like
    a phalanx pushing match, so this hypothesis is a product of educated speculation
    rather than explicit testimony from contemporary sources and is far from being
    academically resolved. \n\nThe Greek term for \"push\" was used in the same metaphorical
    manner as the English word is (for example it was also used to describe the process
    of rhetorical arguments) and so does not necessarily describe a literal physical
    push, although it is possible that it did.\nFor instance, if Othismos were to
    accurately describe a physical pushing match, it would be logical to state that
    the deeper phalanx would always win an engagement since the physical strength
    of individuals would not compensate for even one additional rank on the enemy
    side. \n\nHowever, there are numerous examples of shallow phalanxes holding off
    an opponent. \n\nFor instance, at Delium in 424 BC, the Athenian left flank,
    a formation eight men deep, held off a formation of Thebans 25 deep without immediate
    collapse. \n\nIt is difficult with the physical pushing model to imagine eight
    men withstanding the pushing force of 25 opponents for a matter of seconds, let
    alone half the battle.\nSuch arguments have led to a wave of counter-criticism
    to physical shoving theorists. \n\nAdrian Goldsworthy, in his article \"The Othismos,
    Myths and Heresies: The nature of Hoplite Battle\", argues that the physical
    pushing match model does not fit with the average casualty figures of hoplite
    warfare nor the practical realities of moving large formations of men in battle.
    \n\nThis debate has yet to be resolved amongst scholars.\nPractical difficulties
    with this theory also include the fact that, in a shoving match, an eight-foot
    spear is too long to fight effectively or even parry attacks. \n\nSpears enable
    a formation of men to keep their enemies at a distance, parry attacks aimed at
    them and their comrades, and give the necessary reach to strike multiple men
    in the opposite formation. \n\nA pushing match would put enemies so close together
    that a quick stabbing with a knife would kill the front row almost instantly.
    \n\nThe crush of men would also prevent the formation from withdrawing or retreating,
    which would result in much higher casualties than is recorded. \n\nThe speed
    at which this would occur would also end the battle very quickly, instead of
    prolonging it for hours.\n\n\n=== Shields ===\n\nEach individual hoplite carried
    his shield on his left arm, protecting not only himself but also the soldier
    to the left. \n\nThis meant that the men at the extreme right of the phalanx
    were only half-protected. \n\nIn battle, opposing phalanxes would try to exploit
    this weakness by attempting to overlap the enemy's right flank. \n\nIt also meant
    that, in battle, a phalanx would tend to drift to the right (as hoplites sought
    to remain behind the shield of their neighbor). \n\nSome groups, such as the
    Spartans at Nemea, tried to use this phenomenon to their advantage. \n\nIn this
    case, the phalanx would sacrifice its left side, which typically consisted of
    allied troops, in an effort to overtake the enemy from the flank. \n\nIt is unlikely
    that this strategy worked very often, as it is not mentioned frequently in ancient
    Greek literature.There was a leader in each row of a phalanx, and a rear rank
    officer, the ouragos (meaning tail-leader), who kept order in the rear. \n\nThe
    hoplites had to trust their neighbors to protect them and in turn be willing
    to protect their neighbors; a phalanx was thus only as strong as its weakest
    elements. \n\nThe effectiveness of the phalanx therefore depended on how well
    the hoplites could maintain this formation in combat and how well they could
    stand their ground, especially when engaged against another phalanx. \n\nFor
    this reason, the formation was deliberately organized to group friends and family
    close together, thus providing a psychological incentive to support one's fellows,
    and a disincentive, through shame, to panic or attempt to flee. \n\nThe more
    disciplined and courageous the army, the more likely it was to win \u2013 often
    engagements between the various city-states of Greece would be resolved by one
    side fleeing before the battle. \n\nThe Greek word dynamis, the 'will to fight',
    expresses the drive that kept hoplites in formation.\n\nNow of those, who dare,
    abiding one beside another, to advance to the close fray, and the foremost champions,
    fewer die, and they save the people in the rear; but in men that fear, all excellence
    is lost. \n\nNo one could ever in words go through those several ills, which
    befall a man, if he has been actuated by cowardice. \n\nFor 'tis grievous to
    wound in the rear the back of a flying man in hostile war. \n\nShameful too is
    a corpse lying low in the dust, wounded behind in the back by the point of a
    spear.\n\n\n=== Hoplite armament ===\n\nEach hoplite provided his own equipment.
    \n\nThe primary hoplite weapon was a spear around 2.4 metres (7.9 ft) in length
    called a dory. \n\nAlthough accounts of its length vary, it is usually now believed
    to have been seven to nine feet long (~2.1\u20132.7 m). \n\nIt was held one-handed,
    with the other hand holding the hoplite's shield (aspis). \n\nThe spearhead was
    usually a curved leaf shape, while the rear of the spear had a spike called a
    sauroter ('lizard-killer') which was used to stand the spear in the ground (hence
    the name). \n\nIt was also used as a secondary weapon if the main shaft snapped
    or to kill enemies lying on the ground. \n\nThis was a common problem, especially
    for soldiers who were involved in the initial clash with the enemy. \n\nDespite
    the snapping of the spear, hoplites could easily switch to the sauroter without
    great consequence. \n\nThe rear ranks used the secondary end to finish off fallen
    opponents as the phalanx advanced over them.\nThroughout the hoplite era, the
    standard hoplite armour went through many cyclical changes. \n\nAn Archaic hoplite
    typically wore a bronze breastplate, a bronze helmet with cheekplates, as well
    as greaves and other armour. \n\nLater, in the classical period, the breastplate
    became less common, replaced instead with a corselet that some claim was made
    of linothorax (layers of linen glued together), or perhaps of leather, sometimes
    covered in whole or in part with overlapping metal scales. \n\nEventually, even
    greaves became less commonly used, although degrees of heavier armour remained,
    as attested by Xenophon as late as 401 BC.These changes reflected the balancing
    of mobility with protection, especially as cavalry became more prominent in the
    Peloponnesian War and the need to combat light troops, which were increasingly
    used to negate the hoplite's role as the primary force in battle. \n\nYet bronze
    armour remained in some form until the end of the hoplite era. \n\nSome archaeologists
    have pointed out that bronze armour does not actually provide as much protection
    from direct blows as more extensive corselet padding, and have suggested its
    continued use was a matter of status for those who could afford it. \n\nIn the
    classical Greek dialect, there is no word for swordsmen; yet hoplites also carried
    a short sword called the xiphos, used as a secondary weapon if the dory was broken
    or lost. \n\nSamples of the xiphos recovered at excavation sites were typically
    around 60 cm (24 in) in length. \n\nThese swords were double-edged and could
    therefore be used as a cutting and thrusting weapon. \n\nThese short swords were
    often used to stab or cut at the enemy's neck during close combat.Hoplites carried
    a circular shield called a hoplon (often referred to as an aspis) made from wood
    and covered in bronze, measuring roughly 1 metre (3.3 ft) in diameter. \n\nIt
    spanned from chin to knee and was very heavy (8\u201315 kg (18\u201333 lb)).
    \n\nThis medium-sized shield (fairly large for the period considering the average
    male height) was made possible partly by its dish-like shape, which allowed it
    to be supported with the rim on the shoulder. \n\nThis was quite an important
    feature of the shield, especially for the hoplites that remained in the latter
    ranks. \n\nWhile these soldiers continued to help press forward, they did not
    have the added burden of holding up their shield. \n\nBut the circular shield
    was not without its disadvantages. \n\nDespite its mobility, protective curve,
    and double straps the circular shape created gaps in the shield wall at both
    its top and bottom. (Top gaps were somewhat reduced by the one or two spears
    jutting out of the gap. \n\nIn order to minimize the bottom gaps, thick leather
    'curtains' were used but only by an [unknown] percentage of the hoplites, possibly
    mostly in the first row only since there were disadvantages as well: considerable
    added weight on an already heavy shield and a certain additional cost.) These
    gaps left parts of the hoplite exposed to potentially lethal spear thrusts and
    were a persistent vulnerability for hoplites controlling the front lines.\n\n\n===
    Phalangite armament ===\n\nThe phalanx of the Ancient Macedonian kingdom and
    the later Hellenistic successor states was a development of the hoplite phalanx.
    \n\nThe 'phalangites' were armed with a much longer spear, the sarissa, and less
    heavily armoured. \n\nThe sarissa was the pike used by the ancient Macedonian
    army. \n\nIts actual length is unknown, but apparently it was twice as long as
    the dory. \n\nThis makes it at least 14 feet (4.3 m), but 18 feet (5.5 m) appears
    more likely. (The cavalry xyston was 12.5 feet (3.8 m) by comparison.) The great
    length of the pike was balanced by a counterweight at the rear end, which also
    functioned as a butt-spike, allowing the sarissa to be planted into the ground.
    \n\nBecause of its great length, weight and different balance, a sarissa was
    wielded two-handed. \n\nThis meant that the aspis was no longer a practical defence.
    \n\nInstead, the phalangites strapped a smaller pelte shield (usually reserved
    for peltasts, light skirmishers) to their left forearm. \n\nRecent theories,
    including examination of ancient frescoes depicting full sets of weapons and
    armor, claim that the shields used were actually larger than the pelte but smaller
    than the aspis, hanging by leather strap(s) from the left shoulder or from both
    shoulders. \n\nThe shield would retain handling straps in the inner curve, to
    be handled like a (smaller) aspis if the fight progressed to sword-wielding.
    \n\nAlthough in both shield size assumptions this reduced the shield wall, the
    extreme length of the spear kept the enemy at a greater distance, as the pikes
    of the first three to five ranks could all be brought to bear in front of the
    front row. \n\nThis pike had to be held underhand, as the shield would have obscured
    the soldier's vision had it been held overhead. \n\nIt would also be very hard
    to remove a sarissa from anything it stuck in (the earth, shields, and soldiers
    of the opposition) if it were thrust downwards, due to its length. \n\nThe Macedonian
    phalanx was much less able to form a shield wall, but the lengthened spears would
    have compensated for this. \n\nSuch a phalanx formation also reduced the likelihood
    that battles would degenerate into a pushing match.\n\n\n== Deployment and combat
    ==\n\n=== Phalanx composition and strength ===\n\nThe basic combat element of
    the Greek armies was either the stichos (meaning 'file'; usually 8\u201316 men
    strong) or the enomotia (meaning 'sworn' and made up by 2\u20134 stich\u0153,
    totaling up to 32 men), both led by a dim\u0153rites who was assisted by a decadarchos
    and two decaster\u0153 (sing. decasteros). \n\nFour to a maximum of 32 enomoti\xE6
    (depending on the era in question or the city) were forming a lochos led by a
    lochagos, who in this way was in command of initially 100 hoplites to a maximum
    of c. 500 in the late Hellenistic armies. \n\nHere, it has to be noted that the
    military manuals of Asclepiodotus and Aelian use the term lochos to denote a
    file in the phalanx. \n\nA taxis (mora for the Spartans) was the greatest standard
    hoplitic formation of 500 to 1500 men, led by a strategos (general). \n\nThe
    entire army, a total of several taxeis or mor\xE6 was led by a generals' council.
    \n\nThe commander-in-chief was usually called a polemarchos or a strategos autocrator.\n\n\n===
    Phalanx front and depth ===\n\nHoplite phalanxes usually deployed in ranks of
    eight men or more deep; the Macedonian phalanxes were usually 16 men deep, sometimes
    reported to have been arrayed 32 men deep. \n\nThere are some notable extremes;
    at the battles of Leuctra and Mantinea, the Theban general Epaminondas arranged
    the left wing of the phalanx into a \"hammerhead\" of 50 ranks of elite hoplites
    deep (see below) and when depth was less important, phalanxes just four deep
    are recorded, as at the battle of Marathon.The phalanx depth could vary depending
    on the needs of the moment and plans of the general. \n\nWhile the phalanx was
    in march, an eis bathos formation (loose, meaning literally 'in depth') was adopted
    in order to move more freely and maintain order. \n\nThis was also the initial
    battle formation as, in addition, it permitted friendly units to pass through
    whether assaulting or retreating. \n\nIn this status, the phalanx had twice the
    normal depth and each hoplite had to occupy about 1.8\u20132 metres (5 ft 11
    in\u20136 ft 7 in) in width. \n\nWhen enemy infantry was approaching, a rapid
    switch to the pycne (spelled also pucne) formation (dense or tight formation)
    was necessary. \n\nIn that case, each man's space was halved (0.9\u20131 metre
    or 2 feet 11 inches\u20133 feet 3 inches in width) and the formation depth returned
    to normal. \n\nAn even denser formation, the synaspismos or sunaspismos (ultra-tight
    or locked shields formation), was used when the phalanx was expected to experience
    extra pressure, intense missile volleys or frontal cavalry charges. \n\nIn synaspismos,
    the rank depth was half that of a normal phalanx and the width each man occupied
    was as small as 0.45 metres (1.5 ft).\n\n\n=== Stages of combat ===\n\nSeveral
    stages in hoplite combat can be defined:\nEphodos: The hoplites stop singing
    their p\xE6anes (battle hymns) and move towards the enemy, gradually picking
    up pace and momentum. \n\nIn the instants before impact, war cries (alalagm\u0153,
    sing. alalagmos) would be made. \n\nNotable war cries were the Athenian (eleleleleu!
    eleleleleu!) and the Macedonian (alalalalai! alalalalai!) alalagm\u0153.\nKrousis:
    The opposing phalanxes meet each other almost simultaneously along their front.
    \nDoratismos: Repeated, rapid spear thrusts in order to disrupt the enemy formation.
    \n\nThe use of long spears would keep enemies apart as well as allow men in a
    row to assist their comrades next to them. \n\nThe prodding could also open up
    a man to allow a comrade to spear him. \n\nToo hard prodding could get a spear
    stuck in a shield, which would necessitate someone in the back to lend his to
    the now-disarmed man.\nOthismos: Literally 'pushing' after most spears have been
    broken, the hoplites begin to push with their spears and spear shafts against
    their opponents' shields. \n\nThis could be the longest phase.Pararrhexis: 'Breaching'
    the opposing phalanx, the enemy formation shatters and the battle ends. \n\nCavalry
    would be used at this point to mop up the scattered enemy.\n\n\n== Tactics ==\n\nThe
    early history of the phalanx is largely one of combat between hoplite armies
    from competing Greek city-states. \n\nThe usual result was rather identical,
    inflexible formations pushing against each other until one broke. \n\nThe potential
    of the phalanx to achieve something more was demonstrated at Battle of Marathon
    (490 BC). \n\nFacing the much larger army of Darius I, the Athenians thinned
    out their phalanx and consequently lengthened their front, to avoid being outflanked.
    \n\nHowever, even a reduced-depth phalanx proved unstoppable to the lightly armed
    Persian infantry. \n\nAfter routing the Persian wings, the hoplites on the Athenian
    wings wheeled inwards, destroying the elite troop at the Persian centre, resulting
    in a crushing victory for Athens. \n\nThroughout the Greco-Persian Wars the hoplite
    phalanx was to prove superior to the Persian infantry (e.g. the battles of Thermopylae
    and Plataea).\nPerhaps the most prominent example of the phalanx's evolution
    was the oblique order, made famous in the Battle of Leuctra. \n\nThere, the Theban
    general Epaminondas thinned out the right flank and centre of his phalanx, and
    deepened his left flank to an unheard-of 50 men deep. \n\nIn doing so, Epaminondas
    reversed the convention by which the right flank of the phalanx was strongest.
    \n\nThis allowed the Thebans to assault in strength the elite Spartan troops
    on the right flank of the opposing phalanx. \n\nMeanwhile, the centre and right
    flank of the Theban line were echeloned back, from the opposing phalanx, keeping
    the weakened parts of the formation from being engaged. \n\nOnce the Spartan
    right had been routed by the Theban left, the remainder of the Spartan line also
    broke. \n\nThus, by localising the attacking power of the hoplites, Epaminondas
    was able to defeat an enemy previously thought invincible.\nPhilip II of Macedon
    spent several years in Thebes as a hostage, and paid attention to Epaminondas'
    innovations. \n\nOn return to his homeland, he raised a revolutionary new infantry
    force, which was to change the face of the Greek world. \n\nPhilip's phalangites
    were the first force of professional soldiers seen in Ancient Greece apart from
    Sparta. \n\nThey were armed with longer spears (the sarissa) and were drilled
    more thoroughly in more evolved, complicated tactics and manoeuvres. \n\nMore
    importantly, though, Philip's phalanx was part of a multi-faceted, combined force
    that included a variety of skirmishers and cavalry, most notably the famous Companion
    cavalry. \n\nThe Macedonian phalanx now was used to pin the centre of the enemy
    line, while cavalry and more mobile infantry struck at the foe's flanks. \n\nIts
    supremacy over the more static armies fielded by the Greek city-states was shown
    at the Battle of Chaeronea, where Philip II's army crushed the allied Theban
    and Athenian phalanxes.\n\n\n== Weaknesses ==\n\nThe hoplite phalanx was weakest
    when facing an enemy fielding lighter and more flexible troops without its own
    such supporting troops. \n\nAn example of this would be the Battle of Lechaeum,
    where an Athenian contingent led by Iphicrates routed an entire Spartan mora
    (a unit of anywhere from 500 to 900 hoplites). \n\nThe Athenian force had a considerable
    proportion of light missile troops armed with javelins and bows that wore down
    the Spartans with repeated attacks, causing disarray in the Spartan ranks and
    an eventual rout when they spotted Athenian heavy infantry reinforcements trying
    to flank them by boat.\nThe Macedonian phalanx had weaknesses similar to its
    hoplitic predecessor. \n\nTheoretically indestructible from the front, its flanks
    and rear were very vulnerable, and once engaged it may not easily disengage or
    redeploy to face a threat from those directions. \n\nThus, a phalanx facing non-phalangite
    formations required some sort of protection on its flanks\u2014lighter or at
    least more mobile infantry, cavalry, etc. \n\nThis was shown at the Battle of
    Magnesia, where, once the Seleucid supporting cavalry elements were driven off,
    the phalanx was static and unable to go on the offensive against its Roman opponents
    (although they continued to resist stoutly and attempted a fighting withdrawal
    under a hail of Roman missiles, until the elephants posted on their flanks panicked
    and disrupted their formation).\nThe Macedonian phalanx could also lose its cohesion
    without proper coordination or while moving through broken terrain; doing so
    could create gaps between individual blocks/syntagmata, or could prevent a solid
    front within those sub-units as well, causing other sections of the line to bunch
    up. \n\nIn this event, as in the battles of Cynoscephalae and Pydna, the phalanx
    became vulnerable to attacks by more flexible units\u2014such as Roman legionary
    centuries, which were able to avoid the sarissae and engage in hand-to-hand combat
    with the phalangites.\nAnother important area that must be considered concerns
    the psychological tendencies of the hoplites. \n\nBecause the strength of a phalanx
    depended on the ability of the hoplites to maintain their frontline, it was crucial
    that a phalanx be able to quickly and efficiently replace fallen soldiers in
    the front ranks. \n\nIf a phalanx failed to do this in a structured manner, the
    opposing phalanx would have an opportunity to breach the line which, many times,
    would lead to a quick defeat. \n\nThis then implies that the hoplites ranks closer
    to the front must be mentally prepared to replace their fallen comrade and adapt
    to his new position without disrupting the structure of the frontline.Finally,
    most of the phalanx-centric armies tended to lack supporting echelons behind
    the main line of battle. \n\nThis meant that breaking through the line of battle
    or compromising one of its flanks often ensured victory.\n\n\n== Classical decline
    and post-classical use ==\n\nAfter reaching its zenith in the conquests of Alexander
    the Great, the phalanx began a slow decline, as Macedonian successor states declined.
    \n\nThe combined arms tactics used by Alexander and his father were gradually
    replaced by a return to the simpler frontal charge tactics of the hoplite phalanx.
    \n\nThe expense of the supporting arms and cavalry, and the widespread use of
    mercenaries, caused the Diadochi to rely on phalanx vs. phalanx tactics during
    the Wars of the Diadochi.\nThe decline of the Diadochi and the phalanx was linked
    with the rise of Rome and the Roman legions from the 3rd century BC. \n\nThe
    Battle of the Caudine Forks showed the clumsiness of the Roman phalanx against
    the Samnites. \n\nThe Romans had originally employed the phalanx themselves but
    gradually evolved more flexible tactics. \n\nThe result was the three-line Roman
    legion of the middle period of the Roman Republic, the Manipular System. \n\nRomans
    used a phalanx for their third military line, the triarii. \n\nThese were veteran
    reserve troops armed with the hastae or spear. \n\nRome conquered most of the
    Macedonian successor states. \n\nAlso the various Greek city-states and leagues.
    \n\nAs these states ceased to exist, so did the armies which used the traditional
    phalanx. \n\nSubsequently, troops from these regions were equipped, trained and
    fought using the Roman model.\nA phalanx formation called the phoulkon appeared
    in the late Roman army and Byzantine army. \n\nIt had characteristics of the
    classical Greek and Hellenistic phalanxes, but was more flexible. \n\nIt was
    used against cavalry more than infantry.\nHowever, the phalanx did not totally
    disappear. \n\nIn some battles between the Roman army and Hellenistic phalanxes,
    such as Pydna (168 BC), Cynoscephalae (197 BC) and Magnesia (190 BC), the phalanx
    performed well. \n\nIt even drove back the Roman infantry. \n\nHowever, at Cynoscephalae
    and Magnesia, failure to defend the flanks of the phalanx led to defeat. \n\nAt
    Pydna, the phalanx lost cohesion when pursuing retreating Roman soldiers. \n\nThis
    allowed the Romans to penetrate the formation. \n\nThen, Roman close combat skills
    proved decisive. \n\nThe historian Polybius details the effectiveness of the
    Roman legion against the phalanx. \n\nHe deduces that the Romans refused to fight
    the phalanx where the phalanx was effective, Romans offered battle only when
    a legion could exploit the clumsiness and immobility of a phalanx.\n\nSpear-armed
    troops continued to be important elements in many armies until reliable firearms
    became available. \n\nThese did not necessarily fight as a phalanx. \n\nFor example,
    compare the classical phalanx and late medieval pike formations.Military historians
    have suggested that the Scots under William Wallace and Robert the Bruce consciously
    imitated the Hellenistic phalanx to produce the Scots 'hedgehog' or schiltron.
    \n\nHowever, long spears might have been used by Picts and others in Scotlands'
    Early Middle Ages. \n\nPrior to 1066, long spear tactics (also found in North
    Wales) might have been part of irregular warfare in Britain. \n\nThe Scots used
    imported French pikes and dynamic tactics at the Battle of Flodden. \n\nHowever,
    Flodden found the Scots pitted against effective light artillery, while advancing
    over bad ground. \n\nThe combination disorganised the Scotts phalanxes and permitted
    effective attacks by English longbowmen, and soldiers wielding shorter, handier
    polearms called bills. \n\nSome contemporary sources might say that the bills
    cut off the heads of Scots pikes.\nThe pike was briefly reconsidered as a weapon
    by European armies in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. \n\nIt could protect
    riflemen, whose slower rate of fire made them vulnerable. \n\nA collapsible pike
    was invented but never issued. \n\nThe Confederate Army considered these for
    the American Civil War. \n\nSome were even manufactured but probably were never
    issued. \n\nPikes were manufactured during World War II as \"Croft's Pikes\".\nWhile
    obsolete in military practice, the phalanx remained in use as a metaphor of warriors
    moving forward as a single united block. \n\nThis metaphor inspired several 20th-century
    political movements, notably the Spanish Falange and its ideology of Falangism.\nThe
    Byzantines continued and improved the use of the classical Greek phalanx alongside
    the Macedonian-style phalanx. \n\nThe latter was based on a model that Alexander
    himself had created and had tried to give more importance to the skirmishers
    and cavalry, yet it never saw action until the Byzantines adopted the model that
    rely in a mixture of many units sometimes. \n\nMany writers of the age describe
    the spear as being a sarissa yet it was a meter short than the original sarissa
    and had being modified by the time, yet the term for the long spear remained
    alongside with its other names.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phalanx"

  descriptionText: "\n\nCOSTAL CARTILAGE(S)\n\n\nThe costal cartilages are bars of
    hyaline cartilage that serve to prolong the ribs forward and contribute to the
    elasticity of the walls of the thorax. \n\nCostal cartilage is only found at
    the anterior ends of the ribs, providing medial extension.\n\n\n== Differences
    from Ribs 1-12 ==\n\nThe first seven pairs are connected with the sternum; the
    next three are each articulated with the lower border of the cartilage of the
    preceding rib; the last two have pointed extremities, which end in the wall of
    the abdomen.Like the ribs, the costal cartilages vary in their length, breadth,
    and direction. \n\nThey increase in length from the first to the seventh, then
    gradually decrease to the twelfth.\n\nTheir breadth, as well as that of the intervals
    between them, diminishes from the first to the last. \n\nThey are broad at their
    attachments to the ribs, and taper toward their sternal extremities, excepting
    the first two, which are of the same breadth throughout, and the sixth, seventh,
    and eighth, which are enlarged where their margins are in contact.\n\nThey also
    vary in direction: the first descends a little to the sternum, the second is
    horizontal, the third ascends slightly, while the others are angular, following
    the course of the ribs for a short distance, and then ascending to the sternum
    or preceding cartilage.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nEach costal cartilage presents
    two surfaces, two borders, and two extremities.\n\n\n=== Surfaces ===\n\nThe
    anterior surface is convex, and looks forward and upward: that of the first gives
    attachment to the costoclavicular ligament and the subclavius muscle; those of
    the first six or seven at their sternal ends, to the pectoralis major. \n\nThe
    others are covered by, and give partial attachment to, some of the flat muscles
    of the abdomen.\n\nThe posterior surface is concave, and directed backward and
    downward; that of the first gives attachment to the sternothyroideus, those of
    the third to the sixth inclusive to the transversus thoracis muscle, and the
    six or seven inferior ones to the transversus abdominis muscle and the diaphragm.\n\n\n===
    Borders ===\n\nOf the two borders the superior is concave, the inferior convex;
    they afford attachment to the intercostales interni: the upper border of the
    sixth gives attachment also to the pectoralis major.\n\nThe inferior borders
    of the sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth cartilages present heel-like projections
    at the points of greatest convexity. \n\nThese projections carry smooth oblong
    facets which articulate with facets on slight projections from the upper borders
    of the seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth cartilages, respectively.\n\n\n=== Interchondral
    articulations ===\n\nThe interchondral articulations are the joints formed between
    the costal cartilages of the ribs. \n\nThe contiguous borders of the sixth, seventh,
    and eighth, and sometimes those of the ninth and tenth, costal cartilages articulate
    with each other by small, smooth, oblong facets. \n\nEach articulation is enclosed
    in a thin articular capsule, lined by synovial membrane and strengthened laterally
    and medially by ligamentous fibers (interchondral ligaments) which pass from
    one cartilage to the other. \n\nSometimes the fifth costal cartilages, more rarely
    the ninth and tenth, articulate by their lower borders with the adjoining cartilages
    by small oval facets; more frequently the connection is by a few ligamentous
    fibers.\n\n\n=== Extremities ===\n\nThe lateral end of each cartilage is continuous
    with the osseous tissue of the rib to which it belongs.\n\nThe medial end of
    the first is continuous with the sternum; the medial ends of the six succeeding
    ones are rounded and are received into shallow concavities on the lateral margins
    of the sternum.\n\nThe medial ends of the eighth, ninth, and tenth costal cartilages
    are pointed, and are connected each with the cartilage immediately above.\n\nThose
    of the eleventh and twelfth are pointed and free.\n\n\n== Clinical significance
    ==\n\nIn old age, the costal cartilages are prone to superficial ossification.In
    costochondritis and Tietze syndrome, inflammation of the costal cartilage occurs.
    \n\nThis is a common cause of chest pain.Severe trauma may lead to fracture of
    the costal cartilage. \n\nSuch injuries often go unnoticed during x-ray scans,
    but can be diagnosed with CT scans. \n\nSurgery is typically used to fix the
    costal cartilage back onto either the rib or sternum.Costal cartilage may be
    harvested for reparative use elsewhere in the body. \n\nWhilst this is typically
    conducted using a general anaesthetic, IV sedation can also be used. \n\nThe
    procedure presents a minor risk of pleural tear.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costal_cartilage"

  descriptionText: "\n\nCOSTAL CARTILAGE(S)\n\n\nThe costal cartilages are bars of
    hyaline cartilage that serve to prolong the ribs forward and contribute to the
    elasticity of the walls of the thorax. \n\nCostal cartilage is only found at
    the anterior ends of the ribs, providing medial extension.\n\n\n== Differences
    from Ribs 1-12 ==\n\nThe first seven pairs are connected with the sternum; the
    next three are each articulated with the lower border of the cartilage of the
    preceding rib; the last two have pointed extremities, which end in the wall of
    the abdomen.Like the ribs, the costal cartilages vary in their length, breadth,
    and direction. \n\nThey increase in length from the first to the seventh, then
    gradually decrease to the twelfth.\n\nTheir breadth, as well as that of the intervals
    between them, diminishes from the first to the last. \n\nThey are broad at their
    attachments to the ribs, and taper toward their sternal extremities, excepting
    the first two, which are of the same breadth throughout, and the sixth, seventh,
    and eighth, which are enlarged where their margins are in contact.\n\nThey also
    vary in direction: the first descends a little to the sternum, the second is
    horizontal, the third ascends slightly, while the others are angular, following
    the course of the ribs for a short distance, and then ascending to the sternum
    or preceding cartilage.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nEach costal cartilage presents
    two surfaces, two borders, and two extremities.\n\n\n=== Surfaces ===\n\nThe
    anterior surface is convex, and looks forward and upward: that of the first gives
    attachment to the costoclavicular ligament and the subclavius muscle; those of
    the first six or seven at their sternal ends, to the pectoralis major. \n\nThe
    others are covered by, and give partial attachment to, some of the flat muscles
    of the abdomen.\n\nThe posterior surface is concave, and directed backward and
    downward; that of the first gives attachment to the sternothyroideus, those of
    the third to the sixth inclusive to the transversus thoracis muscle, and the
    six or seven inferior ones to the transversus abdominis muscle and the diaphragm.\n\n\n===
    Borders ===\n\nOf the two borders the superior is concave, the inferior convex;
    they afford attachment to the intercostales interni: the upper border of the
    sixth gives attachment also to the pectoralis major.\n\nThe inferior borders
    of the sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth cartilages present heel-like projections
    at the points of greatest convexity. \n\nThese projections carry smooth oblong
    facets which articulate with facets on slight projections from the upper borders
    of the seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth cartilages, respectively.\n\n\n=== Interchondral
    articulations ===\n\nThe interchondral articulations are the joints formed between
    the costal cartilages of the ribs. \n\nThe contiguous borders of the sixth, seventh,
    and eighth, and sometimes those of the ninth and tenth, costal cartilages articulate
    with each other by small, smooth, oblong facets. \n\nEach articulation is enclosed
    in a thin articular capsule, lined by synovial membrane and strengthened laterally
    and medially by ligamentous fibers (interchondral ligaments) which pass from
    one cartilage to the other. \n\nSometimes the fifth costal cartilages, more rarely
    the ninth and tenth, articulate by their lower borders with the adjoining cartilages
    by small oval facets; more frequently the connection is by a few ligamentous
    fibers.\n\n\n=== Extremities ===\n\nThe lateral end of each cartilage is continuous
    with the osseous tissue of the rib to which it belongs.\n\nThe medial end of
    the first is continuous with the sternum; the medial ends of the six succeeding
    ones are rounded and are received into shallow concavities on the lateral margins
    of the sternum.\n\nThe medial ends of the eighth, ninth, and tenth costal cartilages
    are pointed, and are connected each with the cartilage immediately above.\n\nThose
    of the eleventh and twelfth are pointed and free.\n\n\n== Clinical significance
    ==\n\nIn old age, the costal cartilages are prone to superficial ossification.In
    costochondritis and Tietze syndrome, inflammation of the costal cartilage occurs.
    \n\nThis is a common cause of chest pain.Severe trauma may lead to fracture of
    the costal cartilage. \n\nSuch injuries often go unnoticed during x-ray scans,
    but can be diagnosed with CT scans. \n\nSurgery is typically used to fix the
    costal cartilage back onto either the rib or sternum.Costal cartilage may be
    harvested for reparative use elsewhere in the body. \n\nWhilst this is typically
    conducted using a general anaesthetic, IV sedation can also be used. \n\nThe
    procedure presents a minor risk of pleural tear.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costal_cartilage"

  descriptionText: "\n\nULNA\n\n\nThe ulna (pl. ulnae or ulnas) is a long bone found
    in the forearm that stretches from the elbow to the smallest finger, and when
    in anatomical position, is found on the medial side of the forearm. \n\nIt runs
    parallel to the radius, the other long bone in the forearm. \n\nThe ulna is usually
    slightly longer than the radius, but the radius is thicker. \n\nTherefore, the
    radius is considered to be the larger of the two.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe
    ulna is a long bone found in the forearm that stretches from the elbow to the
    smallest finger, and when in anatomical position, is found on the medial side
    of the forearm. It is broader close to the elbow, and narrows as it approaches
    the wrist.\n\nClose to the elbow, the ulna has a bony process, the olecranon
    process, a hook-like structure that fits into the olecranon fossa of the humerus.
    \n\nThis prevents hyperextension and forms a hinge joint with the trochlea of
    the humerus. \n\nThere is also a radial notch for the head of the radius, and
    the ulnar tuberosity to which muscles attach.\n\nClose to the wrist, the ulna
    has a styloid process.\n\n\n=== Near the elbow ===\n\nNear the elbow, the ulna
    has two curved processes, the olecranon and the coronoid process; and two concave,
    articular cavities, the semilunar and radial notches.\n\nThe olecranon is a large,
    thick, curved eminence, situated at the upper and back part of the ulna. \n\nIt
    is bent forward at the summit so as to present a prominent lip which is received
    into the olecranon fossa of the humerus in extension of the forearm. \n\nIts
    base is contracted where it joins the body and the narrowest part of the upper
    end of the ulna. \n\nIts posterior surface, directed backward, is triangular,
    smooth, subcutaneous, and covered by a bursa. \n\nIts superior surface is of
    quadrilateral form, marked behind by a rough impression for the insertion of
    the triceps brachii; and in front, near the margin, by a slight transverse groove
    for the attachment of part of the posterior ligament of the elbow joint. \n\nIts
    anterior surface is smooth, concave, and forms the upper part of the semilunar
    notch. \n\nIts borders present continuations of the groove on the margin of the
    superior surface; they serve for the attachment of ligaments: the back part of
    the ulnar collateral ligament medially, and the posterior ligament laterally.
    \n\nFrom the medial border a part of the flexor carpi ulnaris arises; while to
    the lateral border the anconeus is attached.\n\nThe coronoid process is a triangular
    eminence projecting forward from the upper and front part of the ulna. \n\nIts
    base is continuous with the body of the bone, and of considerable strength. \n\nIts
    apex is pointed, slightly curved upward, and in flexion of the forearm is received
    into the coronoid fossa of the humerus. \n\nIts upper surface is smooth, concave,
    and forms the lower part of the semilunar notch. \n\nIts antero-inferior surface
    is concave, and marked by a rough impression for the insertion of the brachialis.
    \n\nAt the junction of this surface with the front of the body is a rough eminence,
    the tuberosity of the ulna, which gives insertion to a part of the brachialis;
    to the lateral border of this tuberosity the oblique cord is attached. \n\nIts
    lateral surface presents a narrow, oblong, articular depression, the radial notch.
    \n\nIts medial surface, by its prominent, free margin, serves for the attachment
    of part of the ulnar collateral ligament. \n\nAt the front part of this surface
    is a small rounded eminence for the origin of one head of the flexor digitorum
    superficialis; behind the eminence is a depression for part of the origin of
    the flexor digitorum profundus; descending from the eminence is a ridge which
    gives origin to one head of the pronator teres. \n\nFrequently, the flexor pollicis
    longus arises from the lower part of the coronoid process by a rounded bundle
    of muscular fibers.\n\nThe semilunar notch is a large depression, formed by the
    olecranon and the coronoid process, and serving as articulation with the trochlea
    of the humerus. \n\nAbout the middle of either side of this notch is an indentation,
    which contracts it somewhat, and indicates the junction of the olecranon and
    the coronoid process. \n\nThe notch is concave from above downward, and divided
    into a medial and a lateral portion by a smooth ridge running from the summit
    of the olecranon to the tip of the coronoid process. The medial portion is the
    larger, and is slightly concave transversely; the lateral is convex above, slightly
    concave below.\n\nThe radial notch is a narrow, oblong, articular depression
    on the lateral side of the coronoid process; it receives the circumferential
    articular surface of the head of the radius. \n\nIt is concave from before backward,
    and its prominent extremities serve for the attachment of the annular ligament.\n\n\n===
    Body ===\n\nThe body of the ulna at its upper part is prismatic in form, and
    curved so as to be convex behind and lateralward; its central part is straight;
    its lower part is rounded, smooth, and bent a little lateralward. \n\nIt tapers
    gradually from above downward, and has three borders and three surfaces.\n\n===Borders===\n\nThe
    volar border (margo volaris; anterior border) begins above at the prominent medial
    angle of the coronoid process, and ends below in front of the styloid process.
    \n\nIts upper part, well-defined, and its middle portion, smooth and rounded,
    give origin to the flexor digitorum profundus; its lower fourth serves for the
    origin of the pronator quadratus. \n\nThis border separates the volar from the
    medial surface.\n\nThe dorsal border (margo dorsalis; posterior border) begins
    above at the apex of the triangular subcutaneous surface at the back part of
    the olecranon, and ends below at the back of the styloid process; it is well-marked
    in the upper three-fourths, and gives attachment to an aponeurosis which affords
    a common origin to the flexor carpi ulnaris, the extensor carpi ulnaris, and
    the flexor digitorum profundus; its lower fourth is smooth and rounded. \n\nThis
    border separates the medial from the dorsal surface.\n\nThe interosseous crest
    (crista interossea; external or interosseous border) begins above by the union
    of two lines, which converge from the extremities of the radial notch and enclose
    between them a triangular space for the origin of part of the Supinator; it ends
    below at the head of the ulna. \n\nIts upper part is sharp, its lower fourth
    smooth and rounded. \n\nThis crest gives attachment to the interosseous membrane,
    and separates the volar from the dorsal surface.\n\n===Surfaces===\n\nThe volar
    surface (facies volaris; anterior surface), much broader above than below, is
    concave in its upper three-fourths, and gives origin to the flexor digitorum
    profundus; its lower fourth, also concave, is covered by the pronator quadratus.
    The lower fourth is separated from the remaining portion by a ridge, directed
    obliquely downward and medialward, which marks the extent of origin of the pronator
    quadratus. \n\nAt the junction of the upper with the middle third of the bone
    is the nutrient canal, directed obliquely upward.\n\nThe dorsal surface (facies
    dorsalis; posterior surface) directed backward and lateralward, is broad and
    concave above; convex and somewhat narrower in the middle; narrow, smooth, and
    rounded below. \n\nOn its upper part is an oblique ridge, which runs from the
    dorsal end of the radial notch, downward to the dorsal border; the triangular
    surface above this ridge receives the insertion of the Ancon\xE6us, while the
    upper part of the ridge affords attachment to the supinator. \n\nBelow this the
    surface is subdivided by a longitudinal ridge, sometimes called the perpendicular
    line, into two parts: the medial part is smooth, and covered by the extensor
    carpi ulnaris; the lateral portion, wider and rougher, gives origin from above
    downward to the Supinator, the abductor pollicis longus, the extensor pollicis
    longus, and the extensor indicis proprius.\n\nThe medial surface (facies medialis;
    internal surface) is broad and concave above, narrow and convex below. \n\nIts
    upper three-fourths give origin to the Flexor digitorum profundus; its lower
    fourth is subcutaneous.\n\n\n=== Near the wrist ===\n\nThe head of ulna presents
    an articular surface, part of which, of an oval or semilunar form, is directed
    downward, and articulates with the upper surface of the triangular articular
    disc which separates it from the wrist-joint; the remaining portion, directed
    lateralward, is narrow, convex, and received into the ulnar notch of the radius.\n\nNear
    the wrist, the ulnar, with two eminences; the lateral and larger is a rounded,
    articular eminence, termed the head of the ulna; the medial, narrower and more
    projecting, is a non-articular eminence, the styloid process.\n\nThe head presents
    an articular surface, part of which, of an oval or semilunar form, is directed
    downward, and articulates with the upper surface of the triangular articular
    disk which separates it from the wrist-joint; the remaining portion, directed
    lateralward, is narrow, convex, and received into the ulnar notch of the radius.\n\nThe
    styloid process projects from the medial and back part of the bone; it descends
    a little lower than the head, and its rounded end affords attachment to the ulnar
    collateral ligament of the wrist-joint.\n\nThe head is separated from the styloid
    process by a depression for the attachment of the apex of the triangular articular
    disk, and behind, by a shallow groove for the tendon of the extensor carpi ulnaris.\n\n\t\t\n===
    Microanatomy ===\n\nThe ulna is a long bone. \n\nThe long, narrow medullary cavity
    of the ulna is enclosed in a strong wall of cortical tissue which is thickest
    along the interosseous border and dorsal surface. At the extremities the compact
    layer thins.\n\nThe compact layer is continued onto the back of the olecranon
    as a plate of close spongy bone with lamell\xE6 parallel. \n\nFrom the inner
    surface of this plate and the compact layer below it trabecul\xE6 arch forward
    toward the olecranon and coronoid and cross other trabecul\xE6, passing backward
    over the medullary cavity from the upper part of the shaft below the coronoid.
    Below the coronoid process there is a small area of compact bone from which trabecul\xE6
    curve upward to end obliquely to the surface of the semilunar notch which is
    coated with a thin layer of compact bone.\n\nThe trabecul\xE6 at the lower end
    have a more longitudinal direction.\n\n\n=== Development ===\n\nThe ulna is ossified
    from three centers: one each for the body, the wrist end, and the elbow end,
    near the top of the olecranon. \n\nOssification begins near the middle of the
    body of the ulna, about the eighth week of fetal life, and soon extends through
    the greater part of the bone.\n\nAt birth, the ends are cartilaginous. \n\nAbout
    the fourth year or so, a center appears in the middle of the head, and soon extends
    into the ulnar styloid process. \n\nAbout the tenth year, a center appears in
    the olecranon near its extremity, the chief part of this process being formed
    by an upward extension of the body. \n\nThe upper epiphysis joins the body about
    the sixteenth, the lower about the twentieth year.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\n\n===
    Joints ===\n\nThe ulna forms part of the wrist joint and elbow joints. \n\nSpecifically,
    the ulna joins (articulates) with:\n\n-trochlea of the humerus, at the right
    side elbow as a hinge joint with semilunar trochlear notch of the ulna.\n-the
    radius, near the elbow as a pivot joint, this allows the radius to cross over
    the ulna in pronation.\n-the distal radius, where it fits into the ulnar notch.\n-the
    radius along its length via the interosseous membrane that forms a syndesmosis
    joint\n\n\n=== Muscle attachments ===\n\n\n== Clinical significance ==\n\n\n===
    Fractures ===\n\nSpecific types of ulna fracture include:\n\n-Monteggia fracture
    - a fracture of the proximal third of the ulna with the dislocation of the head
    of the radius\n-Hume fracture - a fracture of the olecranon with an associated
    anterior dislocation of the radial headConservative management is possible for
    ulnar fractures when they are located in the distal two-thirds, only involve
    the shaft, with no shortening, less than 10\xB0 angulation and less than 50%
    displacement. \n\nIn such cases, a cast should be applied that goes above the
    elbow.\n\n\n== Other animals ==\n\nIn four-legged animals, the radius is the
    main load-bearing bone of the lower forelimb, and the ulna is important primarily
    for muscular attachment. \n\nIn many mammals, the ulna is partially or wholly
    fused with the radius, and may therefore not exist as a separate bone. \n\nHowever,
    even in extreme cases of fusion, such as in horses, the olecranon process is
    still present, albeit as a projection from the upper radius.\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulna"

  descriptionText: "\n\nVOMER\n\n\nThe vomer is one of the unpaired facial bones
    of the skull. \n\nIt is located in the midsagittal line, and articulates with
    the sphenoid, the ethmoid, the left and right palatine bones, and the left and
    right maxillary bones. \n\nThe vomer forms the inferior part of the nasal septum,
    with the superior part formed by the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone.
    \n\nThe name is derived from the Latin word for a ploughshare and the shape of
    the bone.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe vomer is situated in the median plane,
    but its anterior portion is frequently bent to one side.\n\nIt is thin, somewhat
    quadrilateral in shape, and forms the hinder and lower part of the nasal septum;
    it has two surfaces and four borders.\n\nThe surfaces are marked by small furrows
    for blood vessels, and on each is the nasopalatine groove, which runs obliquely
    downward and forward, and lodges the nasopalatine nerve and vessels.\n\n\n===
    Borders ===\n\nThe superior border, the thickest, presents a deep furrow, bounded
    on either side by a horizontal projecting expansion of bone \u2013 called the
    wing of vomer; the furrow receives the rostrum of the sphenoid, while the margins
    of the alae articulate with the vaginal processes of the medial pterygoid plates
    of the sphenoid behind, and with the sphenoidal processes of the palatine bones
    in front.\n\nThe inferior border articulates with the crest formed by the maxill\xE6
    and palatine bones.\n\nThe anterior border is the longest and slopes downward
    and forward. \n\nIts upper half is fused with the perpendicular plate of the
    ethmoid; its lower half is grooved for the inferior margin of the septal cartilage
    of the nose.\nThe posterior border is free of bony articulation, having no muscle
    attachments. \n\nIt is concave, separates the choanae, and is thick and bifid
    above, thin below.\n\n\n=== Articulations ===\n\nThe vomer articulates with six
    bones:\n\ntwo of the cranium, the sphenoid and ethmoid.\nfour of the face, two
    maxillae; and two palatine bones.\n\nIt also articulates with the septal cartilage
    of the nose.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\nThe vomeronasal organ, also called Jacobson's
    organ, is a chemoreceptor organ named for its closeness to the vomer and nasal
    bones, and is particularly developed in animals such as cats (who adopt a characteristic
    pose called the Flehmen reaction or flehming when making use of it), and is thought
    to have to do with the perception of certain pheromones.\n\n\n== In other animals
    ==\n\nIn bony fish, the vomers are flattened, paired, bones forming the anterior
    part of the roof of the mouth, just behind the premaxillary bones. \n\nIn many
    species, they have teeth, supplementing those in the jaw proper; in some labyrinthodonts
    (extinct amphibians) the teeth on the vomers were actually larger than the primary
    set. \n\nIn amphibians and reptiles, the vomers become narrower, due to the presence
    of the enlarged choanae (the inner part of the nostrils) on either side, and
    they may extend further back in the jaw. \n\nThey are typically small in birds,
    where they form the upper hind part of the beak, again being located between
    the choanae.In mammals, the vomers have become narrower still, and are fused
    into a single, vertically oriented bone. \n\nThe development of the hard palate
    beneath the vomer means that the bone is now located in a nasal chamber, separate
    from the mouth.\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomer"

  descriptionText: "\n\nMOLAR (TOOTH)\n\n\nThe molars or molar teeth are large, flat
    teeth at the back of the mouth. \n\nThey are more developed in mammals. \n\nThey
    are used primarily to grind food during chewing. \n\nThe name molar derives from
    Latin, molaris dens, meaning \"millstone tooth\", from mola, millstone and dens,
    tooth. \n\nMolars show a great deal of diversity in size and shape across mammal
    groups. \n\nThe third molar of humans is sometimes vestigial.\n\n\n== Human anatomy
    ==\n\n\nIn humans, the molar teeth have either four or five cusps. \n\nAdult
    humans have 12 molars, in four groups of three at the back of the mouth. \n\nThe
    third, rearmost molar in each group is called a wisdom tooth. \n\nIt is the last
    tooth to appear, breaking through the front of the gum at about the age of 20,
    although this varies from individual to individual. \n\nRace can also affect
    the age at which this occurs, with statistical variations between groups. \n\nIn
    some cases, it may not even erupt at all.\nThe human mouth contains upper (maxillary)
    and lower (mandibular) molars. \n\nThey are: maxillary first molar, maxillary
    second molar, maxillary third molar, mandibular first molar, mandibular second
    molar, and mandibular third molar.\n\n\n== Mammal evolution ==\n\n\nIn mammals,
    the crown of the molars and premolars is folded into a wide range of complex
    shapes. \n\nThe basic elements of the crown are the more or less conical projections
    called cusps and the valleys that separate them. \n\nThe cusps contain both dentine
    and enamel, whereas minor projections on the crown, called crenulations, are
    the result of different enamel thickness. \n\nCusps are occasionally joined to
    form ridges and expanded to form crests. \n\nCingula are often incomplete ridges
    that pass around the base of the crown.Mammalian, multicusped cheek teeth probably
    evolved from single-cusped teeth in synapsids, although the diversity of therapsid
    molar patterns and the complexity in the molars of the earliest mammals make
    determining how this happened impossible. \n\nAccording to the widely accepted
    \"differentiation theory\", additional cusps have arisen by budding or outgrowth
    from the crown, while the rivalling \"concrescence theory\" instead proposes
    that complex teeth evolved by the clustering of originally separate conical teeth.
    \n\nTherian mammals (placentals and marsupials) are generally agreed to have
    evolved from an ancestor with tribosphenic cheek teeth, with three main cusps
    arranged in a triangle.\n\n\n== Morphology ==\n\n\nEach major cusp on an upper
    molar is called a cone and is identified by a prefix dependent on its relative
    location on the tooth: proto-, para-, meta-, hypo-, and ento-. \n\nSuffixes are
    added to these names: -id is added to cusps on a lower molar (e.g., protoconid);
    -ule to a minor cusp (e.g., protoconulid). \n\nA shelf-like ridge on the lower
    part of the crown (on an upper molar) is called a cingulum; the same feature
    on the lower molar a cingulid, and a minor cusp on these, for example, a cingular
    cuspule or conulid.\n\n\n=== Tribosphenic ===\n\n\nThe design that is considered
    one of the most important characteristics of mammals is a three-cusped shape
    called a tribosphenic molar. \n\nThis molar design has two important features:
    the trigonid, or shearing end, and the talonid, or crushing heel. \n\nIn modern
    tribosphenic molars, the trigonid is towards the front of the jaw and the talonid
    is towards the rear.\n\nThe tribosphenic tooth is found in insectivores and young
    platypuses (adults have no teeth). \n\nUpper molars look like three-pointed mountain
    ranges; lowers look like two peaks and a third off to the side.\nThe tribosphenic
    design appears primitively in all groups of mammals. \n\nSome paleontologists
    believe that it developed independently in monotremes (or australosphenidans),
    rather than being inherited from an ancestor that they share with marsupials
    and placentals (or boreosphenidans); but this idea has critics and the debate
    is still going on. \n\nFor example, the dentition of the Early Cretaceous monotreme
    Steropodon is similar to those of Peramus and dryolestoids, which suggests that
    monotremes are related to some pre-tribosphenic therian mammals, but, on the
    other hand, the status of neither of these two groups is well-established.\n\nSome
    Jurassic mammals, such as Shuotherium and Pseudotribos, have \"reversed tribosphenic\"
    molars, in which the talonid is towards the front. \n\nThis variant is regarded
    as an example of convergent evolution.From the primitive tribosphenic tooth,
    molars have diversified into several unique morphologies. \n\nIn many groups,
    a fourth cusp, the hypocone (hypoconid), subsequently evolved (see below).\n\n\n===
    Quadrate ===\n\n\nQuadrate (also called quadritubercular or euthemorphic) molars
    have an additional fourth cusp on the lingual (tongue) side called the hypocone,
    located posterior to the protocone. \n\nQuadrate molars appeared early in mammal
    evolution and are present in many species, including hedgehogs, raccoons, and
    many primates, including humans.\n\nThere may be a fifth cusp.\n\nIn many mammals,
    additional smaller cusps called conules appear between the larger cusps. \n\nThey
    are named after their locations, e.g. a paraconule is located between a paracone
    and a metacone, a hypoconulid is located between a hypoconid and an entoconid.\n\n\n===
    Bunodont ===\n\n\nIn bunodont molars, the cusps are low and rounded hills rather
    than sharp peaks. \n\nThey are most common among omnivores such as pigs, bears,
    and humans. \n\nBunodont molars are effective crushing devices and often basically
    quadrate in shape.\n\n\n=== Hypsodont ===\n\nHypsodont dentition is characterized
    by high-crowned teeth and enamel that extends far past the gum line, which provides
    extra material for wear and tear. \n\nSome examples of animals with hypsodont
    dentition are cattle and horses, all animals that feed on gritty, fibrous material.
    \n\nHypsodont molars can continue to grow throughout life, for example in some
    species of Arvicolinae (herbivorous rodents).Hypsodont molars lack both a crown
    and a neck. \n\nThe occlusal surface is rough and mostly flat, adapted for crushing
    and grinding plant material. \n\nThe body is covered with cementum both above
    and below the gingival line, below which is a layer of enamel covering the entire
    length of the body. \n\nThe cementum and the enamel invaginate into the thick
    layer of dentin.\n\n\n=== Brachydont ===\n\nThe opposite condition to hypsodont
    is called brachydont or brachyodont (from brachys 'short'). \n\nIt is a type
    of dentition characterized by low-crowned teeth. \n\nHuman teeth are brachydont.A
    brachydont tooth has a crown above the gingival line and a neck just below it,
    and at least one root. \n\nA cap of enamel covers the crown and extends down
    to the neck. \n\nCementum is only found below the gingival line. \n\nThe occlusal
    surfaces tend to be pointed, well-suited for holding prey and tearing and shredding.\n\n\n===
    Zalambdodont ===\n\nZalambdodont molars have three cusps, one larger on the lingual
    side and two smaller on the labial side, joined by two crests that form a V-
    or \u03BB-shape. \n\nThe larger inner cusp might be homologous with the paracone
    in a tribosphenic molar, but can also be fused with the metacone. \n\nThe protocone
    is typically missing. \n\nThe two smaller labial cusps are located on an expanded
    shelf called the stylar shelf. \n\nZalambdodont molars are found in, for example,
    golden moles and solenodons.\n\n\n=== Dilambdodont ===\n\nLike zalambdodont molars,
    dilambdodont molars have a distinct ectoloph, but are shaped like two lambdas
    or a W. \n\nOn the lingual side, at the bottom of the W, are the metacone and
    paracone, and the stylar shelf is on the labial side. \n\nA protocone is present
    lingual to the ectoloph. \n\nDilambdodont molars are present in shrews, moles,
    and some insectivorous bats.\n\n\n=== Lophodont ===\n\n\nLophodont teeth are
    easily identified by the differentiating patterns of ridges or lophs of enamel
    interconnecting the cusps on the crowns. \n\nPresent in most herbivores, these
    patterns of lophs can be a simple, ring-like edge, as in mole rats, or a complex
    arrangement of series of ridges and cross-ridges, as those in odd-toed ungulates,
    such as equids.Lophodont molars have hard and elongated enamel ridges called
    lophs oriented either along or perpendicular to the dental row. \n\nLophodont
    molars are common in herbivores that grind their food thoroughly. \n\nExamples
    include tapirs, manatees, and many rodents.When two lophs form transverse, often
    ring-shaped, ridges on a tooth, the arrangement is called bilophodont. \n\nThis
    pattern is common in primates, but can also be found in lagomorphs (hares, rabbits,
    and pikas) and some rodents.\n\nExtreme forms of lophodonty in elephants and
    some rodents (such as Otomys) is known as loxodonty. \n\nThe African elephant
    belongs to a genus called Loxodonta because of this feature.\n\n\n=== Selenodont
    ===\n\nIn selenodont molars (so-named after moon goddess Selene), the major cusp
    is elongated into crescent-shaped ridge. \n\nExamples include most even-toed
    ungulates, such as cattle and deer.\n\n\n=== Secodont ===\n\n\nMany carnivorous
    mammals have enlarged and blade-like teeth especially adapted for slicing and
    chopping called carnassials. \n\nA general term for such blade-like teeth is
    secodont or plagiaulacoid.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_(tooth)"

  descriptionText: "\n\nRADIUS (BONE)\n\n\nThe radius or radial bone is one of the
    two large bones of the forearm, the other being the ulna. \n\nIt extends from
    the lateral side of the elbow to the thumb side of the wrist and runs parallel
    to the ulna. \n\nThe ulna is usually slightly longer than the radius, but the
    radius is thicker. \n\nTherefore the radius is considered to be the larger of
    the two.  \n\nIt is a long bone, prism-shaped and slightly curved longitudinally.\n\nThe
    radius is part of two joints: the elbow and the wrist. \n\nAt the elbow, it joins
    with the capitulum of the humerus, and in a separate region, with the ulna at
    the radial notch. At the wrist, the radius forms a joint with the ulna bone.\n\nThe
    corresponding bone in the lower leg is the fibula.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe
    long narrow medullary cavity is enclosed in a strong wall of compact bone. \n\nIt
    is thickest along the interosseous border and thinnest at the extremities, same
    over the cup-shaped articular surface (fovea) of the head.\n\nThe trabeculae
    of the spongy tissue are somewhat arched at the upper end and pass upward from
    the compact layer of the shaft to the fovea capituli (the humerus's cup-shaped
    articulatory notch); they are crossed by others parallel to the surface of the
    fovea. \n\nThe arrangement at the lower end is somewhat similar. \n\nIt is missing
    in radial aplasia.\nThe radius has a body and two extremities. \n\nThe upper
    extremity of the radius consists of a somewhat cylindrical head articulating
    with the ulna and the humerus, a neck, and a radial tuberosity. \n\nThe body
    of the radius is self-explanatory, and the lower extremity of the radius is roughly
    quadrilateral in shape, with articular surfaces for the ulna, scaphoid and lunate
    bones. \n\nThe distal end of the radius forms two palpable points, radially the
    styloid process and Lister's tubercle on the ulnar side. \n\nAlong with the proximal
    and distal radioulnar articulations, an interosseous membrane originates medially
    along the length of the body of the radius to attach the radius to the ulna.\n\n\n===
    Near the wrist ===\n\nThe distal end of the radius is large and of quadrilateral
    form.\n\n===Joint surfaces===\n\nIt is provided with two articular surfaces \u2013
    one below, for the carpus, and another at the medial side, for the ulna.\n\nThe
    carpal articular surface is triangular, concave, smooth, and divided by a slight
    antero-posterior ridge into two parts. \n\nOf these, the lateral, triangular,
    articulates with the scaphoid bone; the medial, quadrilateral, with the lunate
    bone.\n\nThe articular surface for the ulna is called the ulnar notch (sigmoid
    cavity) of the radius; it is narrow, concave, smooth, and articulates with the
    head of the ulna.\n\nThese two articular surfaces are separated by a prominent
    ridge, to which the base of the triangular articular disk is attached; this disk
    separates the wrist-joint from the distal radioulnar articulation.\n\nOther surfacesThis
    end of the bone has three non-articular surfaces \u2013 volar, dorsal, and lateral.\n\nThe
    volar surface, rough and irregular, affords attachment to the volar radiocarpal
    ligament.\nThe dorsal surface is convex, affords attachment to the dorsal radiocarpal
    ligament, and is marked by three grooves. Enumerated from the lateral side:\n\nThe
    first groove is broad, but shallow, and subdivided into two by a slight ridge:
    the lateral of these two, transmits the tendon of the extensor carpi radialis
    longus muscle; the medial, the tendon of the extensor carpi radialis brevis muscle.\n\nThe
    second is deep but narrow, and bounded laterally by a sharply defined ridge;
    it is directed obliquely from above downward and lateralward, and transmits the
    tendon of the extensor pollicis longus muscle.\n\nThe third is broad, for the
    passage of the tendons of the extensor indicis proprius and extensor digitorum
    communis.\n\nThe lateral surface is prolonged obliquely downward into a strong,
    conical projection, the styloid process, which gives attachment by its base to
    the tendon of the brachioradialis, and by its apex to the radial collateral ligament
    of wrist joint. \n\nThe lateral surface of this process is marked by a flat groove,
    for the tendons of the abductor pollicis longus muscle and extensor pollicis
    brevis muscle.\n\n\n=== Body ===\n\nThe body of the radius (or shaft of radius)
    is prismoid in form, narrower above than below, and slightly curved, so as to
    be convex lateralward. \n\nIt presents three borders and three surfaces.\n\n===Borders===\n\nThe
    volar border (margo volaris; anterior border; palmar;) extends from the lower
    part of the tuberosity above to the anterior part of the base of the styloid
    process below, and separates the volar from the lateral surface. \n\nIts upper
    third is prominent, and from its oblique direction has received the name of the
    oblique line of the radius; it gives origin to the flexor digitorum superficialis
    muscle (also flexor digitorum sublimis) and flexor pollicis longus muscle; the
    surface above the line gives insertion to part of the supinator muscle. \n\nThe
    middle third of the volar border is indistinct and rounded. \n\nThe lower fourth
    is prominent, and gives insertion to the pronator quadratus muscle, and attachment
    to the dorsal carpal ligament; it ends in a small tubercle, into which the tendon
    of the brachioradialis muscle is inserted.\n\nThe dorsal border (margo dorsalis;
    posterior border) begins above at the back of the neck, and ends below at the
    posterior part of the base of the styloid process; it separates the posterior
    from the lateral surface.  is indistinct above and below, but well-marked in
    the middle third of the bone.\n\nThe interosseous border (internal border; crista
    interossea; interosseous crest;) begins above, at the back part of the tuberosity,
    and its upper part is rounded and indistinct; it becomes sharp and prominent
    as it descends, and at its lower part divides into two ridges which are continued
    to the anterior and posterior margins of the ulnar notch. \n\nTo the posterior
    of the two ridges the lower part of the interosseous membrane is attached, while
    the triangular surface between the ridges gives insertion to part of the pronator
    quadratus muscle. \n\nThis crest separates the volar from the dorsal surface,
    and gives attachment to the interosseous membrane.  \n\nThe connection between
    the two bones is actually a joint referred to as a syndesmosis joint.\n\n===Surfaces===\n\nThe
    volar surface (facies volaris; anterior surface) is concave in its upper three-fourths,
    and gives origin to the flexor pollicis longus muscle; it is broad and flat in
    its lower fourth, and affords insertion to the Pronator quadratus. \n\nA prominent
    ridge limits the insertion of the Pronator quadratus below, and between this
    and the inferior border is a triangular rough surface for the attachment of the
    volar radiocarpal ligament. \n\nAt the junction of the upper and middle thirds
    of the volar surface is the nutrient foramen, which is directed obliquely upward.\n\nThe
    dorsal surface (facies dorsalis; posterior surface) is convex, and smooth in
    the upper third of its extent, and covered by the Supinator. \n\nIts middle third
    is broad, slightly concave, and gives origin to the Abductor pollicis longus
    above, and the extensor pollicis brevis muscle below. \n\nIts lower third is
    broad, convex, and covered by the tendons of the muscles which subsequently run
    in the grooves on the lower end of the bone.\n\nThe lateral surface (facies lateralis;
    external surface) is convex throughout its entire extent and is known as the
    convexity of the radius, curving outwards to be convex at the side. \n\nIts upper
    third gives insertion to the supinator muscle. About its center is a rough ridge,
    for the insertion of the pronator teres muscle. \n\nIts lower part is narrow,
    and covered by the tendons of the abductor pollicis longus muscle and extensor
    pollicis brevis muscle.\n\n\n=== Near the elbow ===\n\nThe upper extremity of
    the radius (or proximal extremity) presents a head, neck, and tuberosity.\n\nThe
    radial head has a cylindrical form, and on its upper surface is a shallow cup
    or fovea for articulation with the capitulum (or capitellum) of the humerus.
    \n\nThe circumference of the head is smooth; it is broad medially where it articulates
    with the radial notch of the ulna, narrow in the rest of its extent, which is
    embraced by the annular ligament. \n\nThe deepest point in the fovea is not axi-symmetric
    with the long axis of the radius, creating a cam effect during pronation and
    supination.\n\nThe head is supported on a round, smooth, and constricted portion
    called the neck, on the back of which is a slight ridge for the insertion of
    part of the supinator muscle.\n\nBeneath the neck, on the medial side, is an
    eminence, the radial tuberosity; its surface is divided into a posterior, rough
    portion, for the insertion of the tendon of the biceps brachii muscle, and an
    anterior, smooth portion, on which a bursa is interposed between the tendon and
    the bone.\n\n\n=== Development ===\n\nThe radius is ossified from three centers:
    one for the body, and one for each extremity. \n\nThat for the body makes its
    appearance near the center of the bone, during the eighth week of fetal life.\n\nOssification
    commences in the lower end between 9 and 26 months of age. \n\nThe ossification
    center for the upper end appears by the fifth year.\n\nThe upper epiphysis fuses
    with the body at the age of seventeen or eighteen years, the lower about the
    age of twenty.\n\nAn additional center sometimes found in the radial tuberosity,
    appears about the fourteenth or fifteenth year.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\n=== Muscle
    attachments ===\n\nThe biceps muscle inserts on the radial tuberosity of the
    upper extremity of the bone. \n\nThe upper third of the body of the bone attaches
    to the supinator, the flexor digitorum superficialis, and the flexor pollicis
    longus muscles.\n\nThe middle third of the body attaches to the extensor ossis
    metacarpi pollicis, extensor primi internodii pollicis, and the pronator teres
    muscles.\n\nThe lower quarter of the body attaches to the pronator quadratus
    muscle and the tendon of the supinator longus.\n\n\n== Clinical significance
    ==\n\nRadial aplasia refers to the congenital absence or shortness of the radius.\n\n\n===
    Fracture ===\n\nSpecific fracture types of the radius include:\n\n-Proximal radius
    fracture. \n\n-A fracture within the capsule of the elbow joint results in the
    fat pad sign or \"sail sign\" which is a displacement of the fat pad at the elbow.\n\n-Essex-Lopresti
    fracture \u2013 a fracture of the radial head with concomitant dislocation of
    the distal radio-ulnar joint with disruption of the interosseous membrane.\n\n-Radial
    shaft fracture\n\n-Distal radius fracture\n\n-Galeazzi fracture \u2013 a fracture
    of the radius with dislocation of the distal radioulnar joint\n\n-Colles' fracture
    \u2013 a distal fracture of the radius with dorsal (posterior) displacement of
    the wrist and hand\n\n-Smith's fracture \u2013 a distal fracture of the radius
    with volar (ventral) displacement of the wrist and hand\n\n-Barton's fracture
    \u2013 an intra-articular fracture of the distal radius with dislocation of the
    radiocarpal joint.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe word radius is Latin for \"ray\".
    \n\nIn the context of the radius bone, a ray can be thought of rotating around
    an axis line extending diagonally from center of capitulum to the center of distal
    ulna. \n\nWhile the ulna is the major contributor to the elbow joint, the radius
    primarily contributes to the wrist joint.\n\nThe radius is named so because the
    radius (bone) acts like the radius (of a circle). \n\nIt rotates around the ulna
    and the far end (where it joins to the bones of the hand), known as the styloid
    process of the radius, is the distance from the ulna (center of the circle) to
    the edge of the radius (the circle).  \n\nThe ulna acts as the center point to
    the circle because when the arm is rotated the ulna does not move.\n\n\n== Animals
    ==\n\nIn four-legged animals, the radius is the main load-bearing bone of the
    lower forelimb. \n\nIts structure is similar in most terrestrial tetrapods, but
    it may be fused with the ulna in some mammals (such as horses) and reduced or
    modified in animals with flippers or vestigial forelimbs.\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radius_(bone)"

  descriptionText: "\n\nPREMOLAR\n\n\nThe premolars, also called premolar teeth,
    or bicuspids, are transitional teeth located between the canine and molar teeth.
    \n\nIn humans, there are two premolars per quadrant in the permanent set of teeth,
    making eight premolars total in the mouth. \n\nThey have at least two cusps.
    \n\nPremolars can be considered transitional teeth during chewing, or mastication.
    \n\nThey have properties of both the canines, that lay anterior and molars that
    lay posterior, and so food can be transferred from the canines to the premolars
    and finally to the molars for grinding, instead of directly from the canines
    to the molars.\n\n\n== Human anatomy ==\n\nThe premolars in humans are the maxillary
    first premolar, maxillary second premolar, mandibular first premolar, and the
    mandibular second premolar. \n\nPremolar teeth by definition are permanent teeth
    distal to the canines, preceded by deciduous molars.\n\n\n=== Morphology ===\n\nThere
    is always one large buccal cusp, especially so in the mandibular first premolar.
    \n\nThe lower second premolar almost always presents with two lingual cusps.The
    lower premolars and the upper second premolar usually have one root. \n\nThe
    upper first usually has two roots, but can have just one root, notably in Sinodonts,
    and can sometimes have three roots.Premolars are unique to the permanent dentition.
    \n\nPremolars are referred to as bicuspid (has two main cusps), a buccal and
    a palatal/lingual cusp which are separated by a mesiodistal occlusal fissure.\nThe
    maxillary premolars are trapezoidal in shape. \n\nWhilst the mandibular premolars
    are rhomboidal in shape.\n\n\n==== Maxillary first premolar ====\nThe crown of
    the tooth appears ovoid, wider buccally than palatally\nFrom a buccal view, the
    first premolar is similar to the adjacent canine\nRoots: Two roots buccal and
    palatal. \n\nSometimes (40%) there is only one root.\n\n\n==== Maxillary second
    premolar ====\nSimilar to maxillary first premolar but the mesio-buccal and disto-buccal
    corners are rounder\nThe two cusps are smaller and more equal in size\nShorter
    occlusal fissure\nUsually one root\n\n\n==== Mandibular first premolar ====\n\n-The
    smallest premolar out of all four\n-Dominant buccal cusp and a very small lingual
    cusp\n-The buccal cusp is broad and the lingual cusp is less than half the size
    of the buccal cusp.\n-Two-thirds of the buccal surface can be seen from the occlusal
    aspect\n-A single conical root with an oval/round cross section. \n-The root
    is grooved longitudinally both mesially and distally.\n\n\n==== Mandibular second
    premolar ====\n\nThe crown is larger than the mandibular first premolar\nLingual
    cusp is smaller than the buccal cusp but better developed.\n\nThe lingual and
    buccal cusp is separated by a well defined mesiodistal occlusal fissure\n\nThe
    lingual cusp is divided into two; the mesiolingual and distolingual cusps with
    the mesiolingual cusp being higher and wider than the distolingual.\n\nRoot:
    Single conical root, oval/round in cross section.\n\n\n== Orthodontics ==\n\nThe
    four first premolars are the most commonly removed teeth, in 48.8% of cases,
    when teeth are removed for orthodontic treatment (which is in 45.8% of orthodontic
    patients). \n\nThe removal of only the maxillary first premolars is the second
    likeliest option, in 14.5% of cases.\n\n\n== Other mammals ==\n\nIn primitive
    placental mammals there are four premolars per quadrant, but the most mesial
    two (closer to the front of the mouth) have been lost in catarrhines (Old World
    monkeys and apes, including humans). \n\nPaleontologists therefore refer to human
    premolars as Pm3 and Pm4.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premolar"

    numbered to match the vertebrae they attach to \u2013 one to twelve, from top
    (T1) to bottom. \n\nThe head of the rib is the end part closest to the vertebra
    with which it articulates. \n\nIt is marked by a kidney-shaped articular surface
    which is divided by a horizontal crest into two articulating regions. \n\nThe
    upper region articulates with the inferior costal facet on the vertebra above,
    and the larger region articulates with the superior costal facet on the vertebra
    with the same number. \n\nThe transverse process of a thoracic vertebra also
    articulates at the transverse costal facet with the tubercle of the rib of the
    same number. \n\nThe crest gives attachment to the intra-articular ligament.The
    neck of the rib is the flattened part that extends laterally from the head. \n\nThe
    neck is about 3 cm long. \n\nIts anterior surface is flat and smooth, whilst
    its posterior is perforated by numerous foramina and its surface rough, to give
    attachment to the ligament of the neck. \n\nIts upper border presents a rough
    crest (crista colli costae) for the attachment of the anterior costotransverse
    ligament; its lower border is rounded.\n\nOn the posterior surface at the neck,
    is an eminence\u2014the tubercle that consists of an articular and a non-articular
    portion. \n\nThe articular portion is the lower and more medial of the two and
    presents a small, oval surface for articulation with the transverse costal facet
    on the end of the transverse process of the lower of the two vertebrae to which
    the head is connected. \n\nThe non-articular portion is a rough elevation and
    affords attachment to the ligament of the tubercle. \n\nThe tubercle is much
    more prominent in the upper ribs than in the lower ribs.\n\nThe angle of a rib
    (costal angle) may both refer to the bending part of it, and a prominent line
    in this area, a little in front of the tubercle. \n\nThis line is directed downward
    and laterally; this gives attachment to a tendon of the iliocostalis muscle.
    \n\nAt this point, the rib is bent in two directions, and at the same time twisted
    on its long axis.\n\nThe distance between the angle and the tubercle is progressively
    greater from the second to the tenth ribs. \n\nThe area between the angle and
    the tubercle is rounded, rough, and irregular, and serves for the attachment
    of the longissimus dorsi muscle.\n\n\n==== Ribs and vertebrae ====\n\nThe first
    rib (the topmost one) is the most curved and usually the shortest of all the
    ribs; it is broad and flat, its surfaces looking upward and downward, and its
    borders inward and outward.\n        \nThe head is small and rounded, and possesses
    only a single articular facet, for articulation with the body of the first thoracic
    vertebra. \n\nThe neck is narrow and rounded. \n\nThe tubercle, thick and prominent,
    is placed on the outer border. \n\nIt bears a small facet for articulation with
    the transverse costal facet on the transverse process of T1. \n\nThere is no
    angle, but at the tubercle, the rib is slightly bent, with the convexity upward,
    so that the head of the bone is directed downward. \n\nThe upper surface of the
    body is marked by two shallow grooves, separated from each other by a slight
    ridge prolonged internally into a tubercle, the scalene tubercle, for the attachment
    of the anterior scalene; the anterior groove transmits the subclavian vein, the
    posterior the subclavian artery and the lowest trunk of the brachial plexus.
    \n\nBehind the posterior groove is a rough area for the attachment of the medial
    scalene. \n\nThe under surface is smooth and without a costal groove. \n\nThe
    outer border is convex, thick, and rounded, and at its posterior part gives attachment
    to the first digitation of the serratus anterior. \n\nThe inner border is concave,
    thin, and sharp, and marked about its center by the scalene tubercle. \n\nThe
    anterior extremity is larger and thicker than that of any of the other ribs.\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rib_cage"

  descriptionText: "\n\nNASAL BONE\n\n\nThe nasal bones are two small oblong bones,
    varying in size and form in different individuals; they are placed side by side
    at the middle and upper part of the face and by their junction, form the bridge
    of the upper one third of the nose.\n\nEach has two surfaces and four borders.\n\n\n==
    Structure ==\n\nThe two nasal bones are joined at the midline internasal suture
    and make up the bridge of the nose.\n\n\n=== Surfaces ===\n\nThe outer surface
    is concavo-convex from above downward, convex from side to side; it is covered
    by the procerus and nasalis muscles, and perforated about its center by a foramen,
    for the transmission of a small vein.\nThe inner surface is concave from side
    to side, and is traversed from above downward, by a groove for the passage of
    a branch of the nasociliary nerve.\n\n\n=== Articulations ===\n\nThe nasal articulates
    with four bones: two of the cranium, the frontal and ethmoid, and two of the
    face, the opposite nasal and the maxilla.\n\n\n== Other animals ==\n\nIn primitive
    bony fish and tetrapods, the nasal bones are the most anterior of a set of four
    paired bones forming the roof of the skull, being followed in sequence by the
    frontals, the parietals, and the postparietals. \n\nTheir form in living species
    is highly variable, depending on the shape of the head, but they generally form
    the roof of the snout or beak, running from the nostrils to a position short
    of the orbits. \n\nIn most animals, they are generally therefore proportionally
    larger than in humans or great apes, because of the shortened faces of the latter.
    \n\nTurtles, unusually, lack nasal bones, with the prefrontal bones of the orbit
    reaching all the way to the nostrils.\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_bone"

  descriptionText: "\n\nNASAL SEPTAL CARTILAGE\n\n\nThe nasal cartilages are structures
    within the nose that provide form and support to the nasal cavity. \n\nThe nasal
    cartilages are made up of a flexible material called hyaline cartilage (packed
    collagen) in the distal portion of the nose. \n\nThere are five individual cartilages
    that make up the nasal cavity: septal nasal cartilage, lateral nasal cartilage,
    major alar cartilage (greater alar cartilage, or cartilage of the aperture),
    minor alar cartilage (lesser alar cartilage, sesamoid, or accessory cartilage),
    and vomeronasal cartilage (Jacobson's cartilage).\n\nThe nasal cartilages associate
    with other cartilage structures of the nose or with bones of the facial skeleton.
    \n\nThese associations create vent-like structures within the nose so that air
    can flow from the nasal cavity to the lungs or vice versa. \n\nTherefore, the
    nasal cartilages are structures that aid the body in respiratory functions to
    intake oxygen or expire carbon dioxide.\n\nAbnormalities or defects in the nasal
    cartilages affect airflow through the nasal cavity, resulting in respiratory
    issues. \n\nSurgical techniques have been produced to adjust the position or
    repair the nasal cartilages so that maximal airflow is once again accomplished.
    \n\n\n=== Septal Nasal Cartilage ===\n\n\nThe septal nasal cartilage is a flat,
    quadrilateral piece of hyaline cartilage that separates both nasal cavities from
    one another. \n\nThe septal nasal cartilage fits in a place between the perpendicular
    plate of the ethmoid and vomer bones while also being covered by an internal
    mucous membrane. \n\nThe superior portion of the septal nasal cartilage attaches
    to the nasal bones, while the inferior portion attaches to the alar cartilages
    via fibrous tissues. \n\nThe septal nasal cartilage separates both right and
    left nasal cavities, which allows air to pass through them. \n\nProviding two
    cavities generates turbulence within the tight spaces, allowing air to flow quicker
    bidirectionally. \n\nThe septal nasal cartilage is also the main structure that
    provides the orientation of the nose, being the midline structure of the organ.
    \n\nWith an offset septal nasal cartilage, the nose will appear crooked to the
    viewer. \n\nA crooked nose can block airflow coming from the nares to the lungs
    or vice versa. \n\nThis can lead to respiratory issues due to low oxygen but
    high carbon dioxide counts within the body. \n\nA surgical procedure to correct
    this issue is called septoplasty.\n\n\n=== Septoplasty ===\n\n\nSeptoplasty is
    a surgical procedure that straightens the septal nasal cartilage within the center
    of the nose. \n\nWith a crooked septum, it is more difficult for an individual
    to breathe and the risk for getting a sinus infection increases. \n\nAlso called
    a deviated septum, a crooked nose will block one or both sides of the nose, affecting
    the quality of life. \n\nHowever, a deviated septum is very common and does not
    always create respiratory issues. \n\nRespiratory issues usually occur in more
    severe cases, requiring surgery to repair. \n\nSurgery is also permitted to individuals
    that seek cosmetic changes due to moderate cases of a deviated septum. \n\nSurgery
    may require a surgeon to cut and remove parts of the septal nasal cartilages,
    replacing them later in a reconstructed format. \n\nThis will allow the individual
    to receive more airflow through the nostrils when the surgery fully heals after
    3 to 6 months. \n\nHowever, there are some risks correlated with this surgical
    procedure. \n\nThese risks include a change in the shape of the nose, excessive
    bleeding, vacant space in the septum, trouble smelling, blood clots that need
    to be removed, and numbness by the facial region. \n\nSmoking can also cause
    further damage during the healing process of septoplastic surgery.\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_cartilages"

  descriptionText: "\n\nCOSTAL CARTILAGE(S)\n\n\nThe costal cartilages are bars of
    hyaline cartilage that serve to prolong the ribs forward and contribute to the
    elasticity of the walls of the thorax. \n\nCostal cartilage is only found at
    the anterior ends of the ribs, providing medial extension.\n\n\n== Differences
    from Ribs 1-12 ==\n\nThe first seven pairs are connected with the sternum; the
    next three are each articulated with the lower border of the cartilage of the
    preceding rib; the last two have pointed extremities, which end in the wall of
    the abdomen.Like the ribs, the costal cartilages vary in their length, breadth,
    and direction. \n\nThey increase in length from the first to the seventh, then
    gradually decrease to the twelfth.\n\nTheir breadth, as well as that of the intervals
    between them, diminishes from the first to the last. \n\nThey are broad at their
    attachments to the ribs, and taper toward their sternal extremities, excepting
    the first two, which are of the same breadth throughout, and the sixth, seventh,
    and eighth, which are enlarged where their margins are in contact.\n\nThey also
    vary in direction: the first descends a little to the sternum, the second is
    horizontal, the third ascends slightly, while the others are angular, following
    the course of the ribs for a short distance, and then ascending to the sternum
    or preceding cartilage.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nEach costal cartilage presents
    two surfaces, two borders, and two extremities.\n\n\n=== Surfaces ===\n\nThe
    anterior surface is convex, and looks forward and upward: that of the first gives
    attachment to the costoclavicular ligament and the subclavius muscle; those of
    the first six or seven at their sternal ends, to the pectoralis major. \n\nThe
    others are covered by, and give partial attachment to, some of the flat muscles
    of the abdomen.\n\nThe posterior surface is concave, and directed backward and
    downward; that of the first gives attachment to the sternothyroideus, those of
    the third to the sixth inclusive to the transversus thoracis muscle, and the
    six or seven inferior ones to the transversus abdominis muscle and the diaphragm.\n\n\n===
    Borders ===\n\nOf the two borders the superior is concave, the inferior convex;
    they afford attachment to the intercostales interni: the upper border of the
    sixth gives attachment also to the pectoralis major.\n\nThe inferior borders
    of the sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth cartilages present heel-like projections
    at the points of greatest convexity. \n\nThese projections carry smooth oblong
    facets which articulate with facets on slight projections from the upper borders
    of the seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth cartilages, respectively.\n\n\n=== Interchondral
    articulations ===\n\nThe interchondral articulations are the joints formed between
    the costal cartilages of the ribs. \n\nThe contiguous borders of the sixth, seventh,
    and eighth, and sometimes those of the ninth and tenth, costal cartilages articulate
    with each other by small, smooth, oblong facets. \n\nEach articulation is enclosed
    in a thin articular capsule, lined by synovial membrane and strengthened laterally
    and medially by ligamentous fibers (interchondral ligaments) which pass from
    one cartilage to the other. \n\nSometimes the fifth costal cartilages, more rarely
    the ninth and tenth, articulate by their lower borders with the adjoining cartilages
    by small oval facets; more frequently the connection is by a few ligamentous
    fibers.\n\n\n=== Extremities ===\n\nThe lateral end of each cartilage is continuous
    with the osseous tissue of the rib to which it belongs.\n\nThe medial end of
    the first is continuous with the sternum; the medial ends of the six succeeding
    ones are rounded and are received into shallow concavities on the lateral margins
    of the sternum.\n\nThe medial ends of the eighth, ninth, and tenth costal cartilages
    are pointed, and are connected each with the cartilage immediately above.\n\nThose
    of the eleventh and twelfth are pointed and free.\n\n\n== Clinical significance
    ==\n\nIn old age, the costal cartilages are prone to superficial ossification.In
    costochondritis and Tietze syndrome, inflammation of the costal cartilage occurs.
    \n\nThis is a common cause of chest pain.Severe trauma may lead to fracture of
    the costal cartilage. \n\nSuch injuries often go unnoticed during x-ray scans,
    but can be diagnosed with CT scans. \n\nSurgery is typically used to fix the
    costal cartilage back onto either the rib or sternum.Costal cartilage may be
    harvested for reparative use elsewhere in the body. \n\nWhilst this is typically
    conducted using a general anaesthetic, IV sedation can also be used. \n\nThe
    procedure presents a minor risk of pleural tear.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costal_cartilage"

  descriptionText: "\n\nMETATARSAL BONES\n\n\nThe metatarsal bones, or metatarsus
    are a group of five long bones in the foot, located between the tarsal bones
    of the hind- and mid-foot and the phalanges of the toes. \n\nLacking individual
    names, the metatarsal bones are numbered from the medial side (the side of the
    great toe): the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth metatarsal (often depicted
    with Roman numerals). \n\nThe metatarsals are analogous to the metacarpal bones
    of the hand. \n\nThe lengths of the metatarsal bones in humans are, in descending
    order: second, third, fourth, fifth and first.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe five
    metatarsals are dorsally convex long bones consisting of a shaft or body, a base
    (proximally), and a head (distally). \n\nThe body is prismoid in form, tapers
    gradually from the tarsal to the phalangeal extremity, and is curved longitudinally,
    so as to be concave below, slightly convex above. \n\nThe base or posterior extremity
    is wedge-shaped, articulating proximally with the tarsal bones, and by its sides
    with the contiguous metatarsal bones: its dorsal and plantar surfaces are rough
    for the attachment of ligaments. \n\nThe head or distal extremity presents a
    convex articular surface, oblong from above downward, and extending farther backward
    below than above. \n\nIts sides are flattened, and on each is a depression, surmounted
    by a tubercle, for ligamentous attachment. \n\nIts plantar surface is grooved
    antero-posteriorly for the passage of the flexor tendons, and marked on either
    side by an articular eminence continuous with the terminal articular surface.\n\nDuring
    growth, the growth plates are located distally on the metatarsals, except on
    the first metatarsal where it is located proximally. \n\nYet it is quite common
    to have an accessory growth plate on the distal first metatarsal.\n\n\n=== Articulations
    ===\n\n\nThe base of each metatarsal bone articulates with one or more of the
    tarsal bones at the tarsometatarsal joints, and the head with one of the first
    row of phalanges at the metatarsophalangeal joints. \n\nTheir bases also articulate
    with each other at the intermetatarsal joints\n\n-The first metatarsal articulates
    with the medial cuneiform, and to a small extent to the intermediate cuneiform.\n-the
    second with all three cuneiforms.\n-the third with the lateral cuneiform.\n-the
    fourth with the lateral cuneiform and the cuboid.\n-The fifth with the cuboid.\n\n\n==
    Clinical significance ==\n\n=== Injuries ===\n\nThe metatarsal bones are often
    broken by association football players. \n\nThese and other recent cases have
    been attributed to the lightweight design of modern football boots, which provide
    less protection to the foot. \n\nIn 2010 some soccer players began testing a
    new sock that incorporated a rubber silicone pad over the foot to provide protection
    to the top of the foot. \n\nStress fractures are thought to account for 16% of
    injuries related to sports participation, and the metatarsals are the bones most
    often involved. \n\nThese fractures are sometimes called march fractures, based
    on their traditional association with military recruits after long marches. \n\nThe
    second and third metatarsals are fixed while walking, thus these metatarsals
    are common sites of injury. \n\nThe fifth metatarsal may be fractured if the
    foot is oversupinated during locomotion.\n\nProtection from injuries can be given
    by the use of safety footwear which can use built-in or removable metatarsal
    guards.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metatarsal_bones"

  descriptionText: "\n\nINCISOR\n\n\nIncisors (from Latin incidere, \"to cut\") are
    the front teeth present in most mammals. \n\nThey are located in the premaxilla
    above and on the mandible below. \n\nHumans have a total of eight (two on each
    side, top and bottom). \n\nOpossums have 18, whereas armadillos have none.\n\n\n==
    Structure ==\n\nAdult humans normally have eight incisors, two of each type.
    \n\nThe types of incisor are:\n\nmaxillary central incisor (upper jaw, closest
    to the center of the lips)\nmaxillary lateral incisor (upper jaw, beside the
    maxillary central incisor)\nmandibular central incisor (lower jaw, closest to
    the center of the lips)\nmandibular lateral incisor (lower jaw, beside the mandibular
    central incisor)Children with a full set of deciduous teeth (primary teeth) also
    have eight incisors, named the same way as in permanent teeth. \n\nYoung children
    may have from zero to eight incisors depending on the stage of their tooth eruption
    and tooth development. \n\nTypically, the mandibular central incisors erupt first,
    followed by the maxillary central incisors, the mandibular lateral incisors and
    finally the maxillary laterals. \n\nThe rest of the primary dentition erupts
    after the incisors.Apart from the first molars, the incisors are also the first
    permanent teeth to erupt, following the same order as the primary teeth, among
    themselves.\n\n\n=== Other animals ===\n\nAmong other animals, the number varies
    from species to species. \n\nOpossums have 18, whereas armadillos have none.
    \n\nCats, dogs, foxes, pigs, and horses have twelve. \n\nRodents have four. \n\nRabbits
    and hares (lagomorphs) were once considered rodents, but are distinguished by
    having six\u2014one small pair, called \"peg teeth\", is located directly behind
    the most anterior pair. \n\nIncisors are used to bite off tough foods, such as
    red meat.\nCattle (cows, bulls, etc.) have none on top but a total of six on
    the bottom.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\nIn cats, the incisors are small; biting off
    meat is done with the canines and the carnassials. \n\nIn elephants, the upper
    incisors are modified into curved tusks (unlike with Narwhals, where it is a
    canine that develops into a straight and twisted tusk). \n\nThe incisors of rodents
    grow throughout life and are worn by gnawing. \n\nIn humans, the incisors serve
    to cut off pieces of food, as well as in the grip of other food items.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incisor"

    rib pairs; so-called because they are attached only to the vertebrae\u2013and
    not to the sternum or cartilage of the sternum.\n\nThese ribs are relatively
    small and delicate, and include a cartilaginous tip."

  descriptionText: "\n\nFIFTH RIB\n\n\n== Structure of the rib cage ==\n\nRibs are
    described based on their location and connection with the sternum. \n\nAll ribs
    are attached posteriorly to the thoracic vertebrae and are numbered accordingly
    one to twelve. \n\nRibs that articulate directly with the sternum are called
    true ribs, whereas those that do not articulate directly are termed false ribs.
    \n\n\n=== Attachment of the rib cage ===\n\nThe terms true ribs and false ribs
    describe rib pairs that are directly or indirectly attached to the sternum. \n\nThe
    first seven rib pairs known as the fixed or vertebrosternal ribs are the true
    ribs (Latin: costae verae) as they connect directly to the sternum; the next
    five pairs (eighth to twelfth) are the false ribs (Latin: costae spuriae). \n\n\n===
    Parts of rib (general) ===\n\nEach rib consists of a head, neck, and a shaft.
    \n\nAll ribs are attached posteriorly to the thoracic vertebrae. \n\nThey are
    numbered to match the vertebrae they attach to \u2013 one to twelve, from top
    (T1) to bottom. \n\nThe head of the rib is the end part closest to the vertebra
    with which it articulates. \n\nIt is marked by a kidney-shaped articular surface
    which is divided by a horizontal crest into two articulating regions. \n\nThe
    upper region articulates with the inferior costal facet on the vertebra above,
    and the larger region articulates with the superior costal facet on the vertebra
    with the same number. \n\nThe transverse process of a thoracic vertebra also
    articulates at the transverse costal facet with the tubercle of the rib of the
    same number. \n\nThe crest gives attachment to the intra-articular ligament.The
    neck of the rib is the flattened part that extends laterally from the head. \n\nThe
    neck is about 3 cm long. \n\nIts anterior surface is flat and smooth, whilst
    its posterior is perforated by numerous foramina and its surface rough, to give
    attachment to the ligament of the neck. \n\nIts upper border presents a rough
    crest (crista colli costae) for the attachment of the anterior costotransverse
    ligament; its lower border is rounded.\n\nOn the posterior surface at the neck,
    is an eminence\u2014the tubercle that consists of an articular and a non-articular
    portion. \n\nThe articular portion is the lower and more medial of the two and
    presents a small, oval surface for articulation with the transverse costal facet
    on the end of the transverse process of the lower of the two vertebrae to which
    the head is connected. \n\nThe non-articular portion is a rough elevation and
    affords attachment to the ligament of the tubercle. \n\nThe tubercle is much
    more prominent in the upper ribs than in the lower ribs.\n\nThe angle of a rib
    (costal angle) may both refer to the bending part of it, and a prominent line
    in this area, a little in front of the tubercle. \n\nThis line is directed downward
    and laterally; this gives attachment to a tendon of the iliocostalis muscle.
    \n\nAt this point, the rib is bent in two directions, and at the same time twisted
    on its long axis.\n\nThe distance between the angle and the tubercle is progressively
    greater from the second to the tenth ribs. \n\nThe area between the angle and
    the tubercle is rounded, rough, and irregular, and serves for the attachment
    of the longissimus dorsi muscle.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rib_cage"

  descriptionText: "\n\nARYTENOID CARTILAGE\n\n\nThe arytenoid cartilages () are
    a pair of small three-sided pyramids which form part of the larynx. \n\nThey
    are the site of attachment of the vocal cords. \n\nEach is pyramidal or ladle-shaped
    and has three surfaces, a base, and an apex. \n\nThe arytenoid cartilages allow
    for movement of the vocal cords by articulating with the cricoid cartilage. \n\nIt
    may be affected by arthritis, dislocations, or sclerosis.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe
    arytenoid cartilages are part of the posterior part of the larynx.\n\n\n=== Surfaces
    ===\n\nThe posterior surface is triangular, smooth, concave, and gives attachment
    to the arytenoid muscle and transversus.\n\nThe antero-lateral surface is somewhat
    convex and rough. \n\nOn it, near the apex of the cartilage, is a rounded elevation
    (colliculus) from which a ridge (crista arcuata) curves at first backward and
    then downward and forward to the vocal process. \n\nThe lower part of this crest
    intervenes between two depressions or fove\xE6, an upper, triangular, and a lower
    oblong in shape; the latter gives attachment to the thyroarytenoid muscle (vocal
    muscle).\n\nThe medial surface is narrow, smooth, and flattened, covered by mucous
    membrane. \n\nIt forms the lateral boundary of the intercartilaginous part of
    the rima glottidis.\n\n\n=== Base and apex ===\n\nThe base of each cartilage
    is broad, and on it is a concave smooth surface, for articulation with the cricoid
    cartilage.\n\nIts lateral angle is called the muscular process.\nIts anterior
    angle is called the vocal process.\n\nThe apex of each cartilage is pointed,
    curved backward and medialward, and surmounted by a small conical, cartilaginous
    nodule, the corniculate cartilage. \n\nIt articulates with the cricoid lamina
    with a ball-and-socket joint.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\nThe arytenoid cartilages
    allow the vocal folds to be tensed, relaxed, or approximated. \n\nThey articulate
    with the supero-lateral parts of the cricoid cartilage lamina, forming the cricoarytenoid
    joints at which they can come together, move apart, tilt anteriorly or posteriorly,
    and rotate.\n\n\n== Clinical significance ==\n\n\n\n=== Arthritis ===\n\nRheumatoid
    arthritis and osteoarthritis can affect the cricoarytenoid joint. \n\nThis can
    cause airway obstruction, which may be life-threatening.\n\n\n=== Dislocation
    ===\n\nRarely, the arytenoid cartilage may be dislocated. \n\nThis is most often
    caused by tracheal intubation, major trauma to the larynx, or more rarely a laryngeal
    mask airway. \n\nThis may cause symptoms with problems breathing, such as \"breathiness\"
    when breathing. \n\nElectromyography and CT scans of the larynx may be used to
    assess a dislocation in detail. \n\nDislocations may be reduced using an endoscope.\n\n\n===
    Laryngeal cancer ===\n\nSome cases of laryngeal cancer cause the arytenoid cartilage
    to appear sclerotic. \n\nThis may be observed, and is highly predictive of laryngeal
    cancer.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n\n=== Etymology ===\n\nThe term \"arytenoid\"
    comes from Ancient Greek \u1F00\u03C1\u03CD\u03C4\u03B1\u03B9\u03BD\u03B1 arytaina
    meaning \"ladle\" and \u03B5\u1F36\u03B4\u03BF\u03C2 eidos, meaning \"form\".
    \n\nThey are also often described as \"pyramid\" shaped. \n\nThe word \"arytenoid\"
    is pronounced .\n\n\n== Other animals ==\n\nThe arytenoid cartilages are in the
    larynxes of many animals, including horses.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arytenoid_cartilage"

  descriptionText: "\n\nINCISOR\n\n\nIncisors (from Latin incidere, \"to cut\") are
    the front teeth present in most mammals. \n\nThey are located in the premaxilla
    above and on the mandible below. \n\nHumans have a total of eight (two on each
    side, top and bottom). \n\nOpossums have 18, whereas armadillos have none.\n\n\n==
    Structure ==\n\nAdult humans normally have eight incisors, two of each type.
    \n\nThe types of incisor are:\n\nmaxillary central incisor (upper jaw, closest
    to the center of the lips)\nmaxillary lateral incisor (upper jaw, beside the
    maxillary central incisor)\nmandibular central incisor (lower jaw, closest to
    the center of the lips)\nmandibular lateral incisor (lower jaw, beside the mandibular
    central incisor)Children with a full set of deciduous teeth (primary teeth) also
    have eight incisors, named the same way as in permanent teeth. \n\nYoung children
    may have from zero to eight incisors depending on the stage of their tooth eruption
    and tooth development. \n\nTypically, the mandibular central incisors erupt first,
    followed by the maxillary central incisors, the mandibular lateral incisors and
    finally the maxillary laterals. \n\nThe rest of the primary dentition erupts
    after the incisors.Apart from the first molars, the incisors are also the first
    permanent teeth to erupt, following the same order as the primary teeth, among
    themselves.\n\n\n=== Other animals ===\n\nAmong other animals, the number varies
    from species to species. \n\nOpossums have 18, whereas armadillos have none.
    \n\nCats, dogs, foxes, pigs, and horses have twelve. \n\nRodents have four. \n\nRabbits
    and hares (lagomorphs) were once considered rodents, but are distinguished by
    having six\u2014one small pair, called \"peg teeth\", is located directly behind
    the most anterior pair. \n\nIncisors are used to bite off tough foods, such as
    red meat.\nCattle (cows, bulls, etc.) have none on top but a total of six on
    the bottom.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\nIn cats, the incisors are small; biting off
    meat is done with the canines and the carnassials. \n\nIn elephants, the upper
    incisors are modified into curved tusks (unlike with Narwhals, where it is a
    canine that develops into a straight and twisted tusk). \n\nThe incisors of rodents
    grow throughout life and are worn by gnawing. \n\nIn humans, the incisors serve
    to cut off pieces of food, as well as in the grip of other food items.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incisor"

  descriptionText: "\n\nMOLAR (TOOTH)\n\n\nThe molars or molar teeth are large, flat
    teeth at the back of the mouth. \n\nThey are more developed in mammals. \n\nThey
    are used primarily to grind food during chewing. \n\nThe name molar derives from
    Latin, molaris dens, meaning \"millstone tooth\", from mola, millstone and dens,
    tooth. \n\nMolars show a great deal of diversity in size and shape across mammal
    groups. \n\nThe third molar of humans is sometimes vestigial.\n\n\n== Human anatomy
    ==\n\n\nIn humans, the molar teeth have either four or five cusps. \n\nAdult
    humans have 12 molars, in four groups of three at the back of the mouth. \n\nThe
    third, rearmost molar in each group is called a wisdom tooth. \n\nIt is the last
    tooth to appear, breaking through the front of the gum at about the age of 20,
    although this varies from individual to individual. \n\nRace can also affect
    the age at which this occurs, with statistical variations between groups. \n\nIn
    some cases, it may not even erupt at all.\nThe human mouth contains upper (maxillary)
    and lower (mandibular) molars. \n\nThey are: maxillary first molar, maxillary
    second molar, maxillary third molar, mandibular first molar, mandibular second
    molar, and mandibular third molar.\n\n\n== Mammal evolution ==\n\n\nIn mammals,
    the crown of the molars and premolars is folded into a wide range of complex
    shapes. \n\nThe basic elements of the crown are the more or less conical projections
    called cusps and the valleys that separate them. \n\nThe cusps contain both dentine
    and enamel, whereas minor projections on the crown, called crenulations, are
    the result of different enamel thickness. \n\nCusps are occasionally joined to
    form ridges and expanded to form crests. \n\nCingula are often incomplete ridges
    that pass around the base of the crown.Mammalian, multicusped cheek teeth probably
    evolved from single-cusped teeth in synapsids, although the diversity of therapsid
    molar patterns and the complexity in the molars of the earliest mammals make
    determining how this happened impossible. \n\nAccording to the widely accepted
    \"differentiation theory\", additional cusps have arisen by budding or outgrowth
    from the crown, while the rivalling \"concrescence theory\" instead proposes
    that complex teeth evolved by the clustering of originally separate conical teeth.
    \n\nTherian mammals (placentals and marsupials) are generally agreed to have
    evolved from an ancestor with tribosphenic cheek teeth, with three main cusps
    arranged in a triangle.\n\n\n== Morphology ==\n\n\nEach major cusp on an upper
    molar is called a cone and is identified by a prefix dependent on its relative
    location on the tooth: proto-, para-, meta-, hypo-, and ento-. \n\nSuffixes are
    added to these names: -id is added to cusps on a lower molar (e.g., protoconid);
    -ule to a minor cusp (e.g., protoconulid). \n\nA shelf-like ridge on the lower
    part of the crown (on an upper molar) is called a cingulum; the same feature
    on the lower molar a cingulid, and a minor cusp on these, for example, a cingular
    cuspule or conulid.\n\n\n=== Tribosphenic ===\n\n\nThe design that is considered
    one of the most important characteristics of mammals is a three-cusped shape
    called a tribosphenic molar. \n\nThis molar design has two important features:
    the trigonid, or shearing end, and the talonid, or crushing heel. \n\nIn modern
    tribosphenic molars, the trigonid is towards the front of the jaw and the talonid
    is towards the rear.\n\nThe tribosphenic tooth is found in insectivores and young
    platypuses (adults have no teeth). \n\nUpper molars look like three-pointed mountain
    ranges; lowers look like two peaks and a third off to the side.\nThe tribosphenic
    design appears primitively in all groups of mammals. \n\nSome paleontologists
    believe that it developed independently in monotremes (or australosphenidans),
    rather than being inherited from an ancestor that they share with marsupials
    and placentals (or boreosphenidans); but this idea has critics and the debate
    is still going on. \n\nFor example, the dentition of the Early Cretaceous monotreme
    Steropodon is similar to those of Peramus and dryolestoids, which suggests that
    monotremes are related to some pre-tribosphenic therian mammals, but, on the
    other hand, the status of neither of these two groups is well-established.\n\nSome
    Jurassic mammals, such as Shuotherium and Pseudotribos, have \"reversed tribosphenic\"
    molars, in which the talonid is towards the front. \n\nThis variant is regarded
    as an example of convergent evolution.From the primitive tribosphenic tooth,
    molars have diversified into several unique morphologies. \n\nIn many groups,
    a fourth cusp, the hypocone (hypoconid), subsequently evolved (see below).\n\n\n===
    Quadrate ===\n\n\nQuadrate (also called quadritubercular or euthemorphic) molars
    have an additional fourth cusp on the lingual (tongue) side called the hypocone,
    located posterior to the protocone. \n\nQuadrate molars appeared early in mammal
    evolution and are present in many species, including hedgehogs, raccoons, and
    many primates, including humans.\n\nThere may be a fifth cusp.\n\nIn many mammals,
    additional smaller cusps called conules appear between the larger cusps. \n\nThey
    are named after their locations, e.g. a paraconule is located between a paracone
    and a metacone, a hypoconulid is located between a hypoconid and an entoconid.\n\n\n===
    Bunodont ===\n\n\nIn bunodont molars, the cusps are low and rounded hills rather
    than sharp peaks. \n\nThey are most common among omnivores such as pigs, bears,
    and humans. \n\nBunodont molars are effective crushing devices and often basically
    quadrate in shape.\n\n\n=== Hypsodont ===\n\nHypsodont dentition is characterized
    by high-crowned teeth and enamel that extends far past the gum line, which provides
    extra material for wear and tear. \n\nSome examples of animals with hypsodont
    dentition are cattle and horses, all animals that feed on gritty, fibrous material.
    \n\nHypsodont molars can continue to grow throughout life, for example in some
    species of Arvicolinae (herbivorous rodents).Hypsodont molars lack both a crown
    and a neck. \n\nThe occlusal surface is rough and mostly flat, adapted for crushing
    and grinding plant material. \n\nThe body is covered with cementum both above
    and below the gingival line, below which is a layer of enamel covering the entire
    length of the body. \n\nThe cementum and the enamel invaginate into the thick
    layer of dentin.\n\n\n=== Brachydont ===\n\nThe opposite condition to hypsodont
    is called brachydont or brachyodont (from brachys 'short'). \n\nIt is a type
    of dentition characterized by low-crowned teeth. \n\nHuman teeth are brachydont.A
    brachydont tooth has a crown above the gingival line and a neck just below it,
    and at least one root. \n\nA cap of enamel covers the crown and extends down
    to the neck. \n\nCementum is only found below the gingival line. \n\nThe occlusal
    surfaces tend to be pointed, well-suited for holding prey and tearing and shredding.\n\n\n===
    Zalambdodont ===\n\nZalambdodont molars have three cusps, one larger on the lingual
    side and two smaller on the labial side, joined by two crests that form a V-
    or \u03BB-shape. \n\nThe larger inner cusp might be homologous with the paracone
    in a tribosphenic molar, but can also be fused with the metacone. \n\nThe protocone
    is typically missing. \n\nThe two smaller labial cusps are located on an expanded
    shelf called the stylar shelf. \n\nZalambdodont molars are found in, for example,
    golden moles and solenodons.\n\n\n=== Dilambdodont ===\n\nLike zalambdodont molars,
    dilambdodont molars have a distinct ectoloph, but are shaped like two lambdas
    or a W. \n\nOn the lingual side, at the bottom of the W, are the metacone and
    paracone, and the stylar shelf is on the labial side. \n\nA protocone is present
    lingual to the ectoloph. \n\nDilambdodont molars are present in shrews, moles,
    and some insectivorous bats.\n\n\n=== Lophodont ===\n\n\nLophodont teeth are
    easily identified by the differentiating patterns of ridges or lophs of enamel
    interconnecting the cusps on the crowns. \n\nPresent in most herbivores, these
    patterns of lophs can be a simple, ring-like edge, as in mole rats, or a complex
    arrangement of series of ridges and cross-ridges, as those in odd-toed ungulates,
    such as equids.Lophodont molars have hard and elongated enamel ridges called
    lophs oriented either along or perpendicular to the dental row. \n\nLophodont
    molars are common in herbivores that grind their food thoroughly. \n\nExamples
    include tapirs, manatees, and many rodents.When two lophs form transverse, often
    ring-shaped, ridges on a tooth, the arrangement is called bilophodont. \n\nThis
    pattern is common in primates, but can also be found in lagomorphs (hares, rabbits,
    and pikas) and some rodents.\n\nExtreme forms of lophodonty in elephants and
    some rodents (such as Otomys) is known as loxodonty. \n\nThe African elephant
    belongs to a genus called Loxodonta because of this feature.\n\n\n=== Selenodont
    ===\n\nIn selenodont molars (so-named after moon goddess Selene), the major cusp
    is elongated into crescent-shaped ridge. \n\nExamples include most even-toed
    ungulates, such as cattle and deer.\n\n\n=== Secodont ===\n\n\nMany carnivorous
    mammals have enlarged and blade-like teeth especially adapted for slicing and
    chopping called carnassials. \n\nA general term for such blade-like teeth is
    secodont or plagiaulacoid.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_(tooth)"

  descriptionText: "\n\nHIP BONE\n\n\nThe hip bone (os coxae, innominate bone, pelvic
    bone or coxal bone) is a large flat bone, constricted in the center and expanded
    above and below. \n\nIn some vertebrates (including humans before puberty) it
    is composed of three parts: the ilium, ischium, and the pubis.\n\nThe two hip
    bones join at the pubic symphysis and together with the sacrum and coccyx (the
    pelvic part of the spine) comprise the skeletal component of the pelvis \u2013
    the pelvic girdle which surrounds the pelvic cavity. \n\nThey are connected to
    the sacrum, which is part of the axial skeleton, at the sacroiliac joint. Each
    hip bone is connected to the corresponding femur (thigh bone) (forming the primary
    connection between the bones of the lower limb and the axial skeleton) through
    the large ball and socket joint of the hip.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe hip bone
    is formed by three parts: the ilium, ischium, and pubis. \n\nAt birth, these
    three components are separated by hyaline cartilage. \n\nThey join each other
    in a Y-shaped portion of cartilage in the acetabulum. \n\nBy the end of puberty
    the three regions will have fused together, and by the age 25 they will have
    ossified.\n\nThe two hip bones join each other at the pubic symphysis. Together
    with the sacrum and coccyx, the hip bones form the pelvis.\n\n\n=== Ilium ===\n\nIlium
    (plural ilia) is the uppermost and largest region. It makes up two fifths of
    the acetabulum. \n\nIt is divisible into two parts: the body and the ala or wing
    of ilium; the separation is indicated on the top surface by a curved line, the
    arcuate line, and on the external surface by the margin of the acetabulum. \n\nThe
    body of ilium forms the sacroiliac joint with the sacrum. \n\nThe edge of the
    wing of ilium forms the S-shaped iliac crest which is easily located through
    the skin. \n\nThe iliac crest shows clear marks of the attachment of the three
    abdominal wall muscles.\n\n\n=== Ischium ===\n\nThe ischium forms the lower and
    back part of the hip bone and is located below the ilium and behind the pubis.
    \n\nThe ischium is the strongest of the three regions that form the hip bone.
    \n\nIt is divisible into three portions: the body, the superior ramus, and the
    inferior ramus. \n\nThe body forms approximately one-third of the acetabulum.\n\nThe
    ischium forms a large swelling, the tuberosity of the ischium, also referred
    to colloquially as the \"sit bone\". \n\nWhen sitting, the weight is frequently
    placed upon the ischial tuberosity. \n\nThe gluteus maximus covers it in the
    upright posture, but leaves it free in the seated position.\n\n\n=== Pubis ===\n\nThe
    pubic region or pubis is the ventral and anterior of the three parts forming
    the hip bone. \n\nIt is divisible into a body, a superior ramus, and an inferior
    ramus. \n\nThe body forms one-fifth of the acetabulum. \n\nThe body forms the
    wide, strong, medial and flat portion of the pubic bone which unites with the
    other pubic bone in the pubic symphysis. \n\nThe fibrocartilaginous pad which
    lies between the symphysial surfaces of the coxal bones, that secures the pubic
    symphysis, is called the interpubic disc.\n\n\n=== Pelvic brim ===\n\nThe pelvic
    brim is a continuous oval ridge of bone that runs along the pubic symphysis,
    pubic crests, arcuate lines, sacral alae, and sacral promontory.\n\n\n=== False
    pelvis, pelvic inlet, and ramus ===\n\nThe false pelvis is that portion superior
    to the pelvic brim; it is bounded by the alae of the ilia laterally and the sacral
    promontory and lumbar vertebrae posteriorly.\n\nThe true pelvis is the region
    inferior to the pelvic brim that is almost entirely surrounded by bone.\n\nThe
    pelvic inlet is the opening delineated by the pelvic brim. \n\nThe widest dimension
    of the pelvic inlet is from left to right, that is, along the frontal plane.
    \n\nThe pelvic outlet is the margin of the true pelvis. \n\nIt is bounded anteriorly
    by the pubic arch, laterally by the ischia, and posteriorly by the sacrum and
    coccyx.\n\nThe superior pubic ramus is a part of the pubic bone which forms a
    portion of the obturator foramen. \n\nIt extends from the body to the median
    plane where it articulates with its fellow of the opposite side. \n\nIt is conveniently
    described in two portions: a medial flattened part and a narrow lateral prismoid
    portion. \n\nThe inferior pubic ramus is thin and flat. \n\nIt passes laterally
    and downward from the medial end of the superior ramus. \n\nIt becomes narrower
    as it descends and joins with the inferior ramus of the ischium below the obturator
    foramen.\n\n\n== Development and sexual dimorphism ==\n\nThe hip bone is ossified
    from eight centers: three primary, one each for the ilium, ischium, and pubis,
    and five secondary, one each for the iliac crest, the anterior inferior spine
    (said to occur more frequently in the male than in the female), the tuberosity
    of the ischium, the pubic symphysis (more frequent in the female than in the
    male), and one or more for the Y-shaped piece at the bottom of the acetabulum.\n\nThe
    centers appear in the following order: in the lower part of the ilium, immediately
    above the greater sciatic notch, about the eighth or ninth week of fetal life;
    in the superior ramus of the ischium, about the third month; in the superior
    ramus of the pubis, between the fourth and fifth months. \n\nAt birth, the three
    primary centers are quite separate, the crest, the bottom of the acetabulum,
    the ischial tuberosity, and the inferior rami of the ischium and pubis being
    still cartilaginous.\n\nBy the seventh or eighth year, the inferior rami of the
    pubis and ischium are almost completely united by bone. \n\nAbout the thirteenth
    or fourteenth year, the three primary centers have extended their growth into
    the bottom of the acetabulum, and are there separated from each other by a Y-shaped
    portion of cartilage, which now presents traces of ossification, often by two
    or more centers. \n\nOne of these, the os acetabuli, appears about the age of
    twelve, between the ilium and pubis, and fuses with them about the age of eighteen;
    it forms the pubic part of the acetabulum. \n\nThe ilium and ischium then become
    joined, and lastly the pubis and ischium, through the intervention of this Y-shaped
    portion.\n\nAt about the age of puberty, ossification takes place in each of
    the remaining portions, and they join with the rest of the bone between the twentieth
    and twenty-fifth years. \n\nSeparate centers are frequently found for the pubic
    tubercle and the ischial spine, and for the crest and angle of the pubis. \n\nThe
    proportions of the female hip bone may affect the ease of passage of the baby
    during childbirth.\n\n\n== Muscle attachments ==\n\nSeveral muscles attach to
    the hip bone including the internal muscles of the pelvic, abdominal muscles,
    back muscles, all the gluteal muscles, muscles of the lateral rotator group,
    hamstring muscles, two muscles from the anterior compartment of the thigh.\n\n\n===
    Abdominal muscles ===\n\nThe abdominal external oblique muscle attaches to the
    iliac crest.\n\nThe abdominal internal oblique muscle attaches to pecten pubis.\n\nThe
    transversus abdominis muscle attaches to the pubic crest and pecten pubis via
    a conjoint tendon\n\n\n=== Back muscles ===\n\nThe multifidus muscle in the sacral
    region attaches to the medial surface of posterior superior iliac spine, the
    posterior sacroiliac ligaments and several places to the sacrum.\n\n\n=== Gluteal
    muscles ===\n\nThe gluteus maximus muscle arises from the posterior gluteal line
    of the inner upper ilium, and the rough portion of bone including the iliac crest,
    the fascia covering the gluteus medius (gluteal aponeurosis), as well as the
    sacrum, coccyx, the erector spinae (lumbodorsal fascia), the sacrotuberous ligament.\n\nThe
    gluteus medius muscle: originates on the outer surface of the ilium between the
    iliac crest and the posterior gluteal line above, and the anterior gluteal line
    below. \n\nThe gluteus medius also originates from the gluteal aponeurosis that
    covers its outer surface.\n\nGluteus minimus muscle originates between the anterior
    and inferior gluteal lines, and from the margin of the greater sciatic notch.\n\n\n===
    Lateral rotator group ===\n\nThe piriformis muscle originates from the superior
    margin of the greater sciatic notch (as well as the sacroiliac joint capsule
    and the sacrotuberous ligament and  part of the spine and sacrum.\n\nThe superior
    gemellus muscle arises from the outer surface of the ischial spine.\n\n\nThe
    obturator internus muscle arises from the inner surface of the antero-lateral
    wall of the hip bone, where it surrounds the greater part of the obturator foramen,
    being attached to the inferior rami of the pubis and ischium, and at the side
    to the inner surface of the hip bone below and behind the pelvic brim, reaching
    from the upper part of the greater sciatic foramen above and behind to the obturator
    foramen below and in front. \n\nIt also arises from the pelvic surface of the
    obturator membrane except in the posterior part, from the tendinous arch, and
    to a slight extent from the obturator fascia, which covers the muscle.\n\nThe
    inferior gemellus muscle arises from the upper part of the tuberosity of the
    ischium, immediately below the groove for the obturator internus tendon.\n\nThe
    obturator externus muscle arises from the margin of bone immediately around the
    medial side of the obturator foramen, from the rami of the pubis, and the inferior
    ramus of the ischium; it also arises from the medial two-thirds of the outer
    surface of the obturator membrane, and from the tendinous arch.\n\n\n=== Hamstrings
    ===\n\n-The long head biceps femoris arises from the lower and inner impression
    on the back part of the tuberosity of the ischium, by a tendon common to it and
    the semitendinosus, and from the lower part of the sacrotuberous ligament;\n\n-The
    semitendinosus arises from the lower and medial impression on the tuberosity
    of the ischium, by a tendon common to it and the long head of the biceps femoris;
    it also arises from an aponeurosis which connects the adjacent surfaces of the
    two muscles to the extent of about 7.5 cm. from their origin.\n\n-The semimembranosus
    arises from the lower and medial impression on the tuberosity of the ischium\n\n\n===
    Anterior compartment of thigh ===\n\n-The rectus femoris muscle arises by two
    tendons: one, the anterior or straight, from the anterior inferior iliac spine;
    the other, the posterior or reflected, from a groove above the rim of the acetabulum.\n\n-The
    sartorius muscle arises by tendinous fibres from the anterior superior iliac
    spine,\n\n\n=== Shoulder muscles ===\n\nThe latissimus dorsi muscle attaches
    to the iliac crest and several places on the spine and ribs.\n\n\n== Clinical
    significance ==\n\n\n=== Fractures ===\n\nFractures of the hip bone are termed
    pelvic fractures, and should not be confused with hip fractures, which are actually
    femoral fractures that occur in the proximal end of the femur.\n\n\n=== Preparation
    for childbirth ===\n\nPelvimetry is the assessment of the female pelvis in relation
    to the birth of a baby in order to detect an increased risk for obstructed labor.\n\n\n==
    Evolution of the pelvis in animals ==\n\nThe hip bone first appears in fishes,
    where it consists of a simple, usually triangular bone, to which the pelvic fin
    articulates. \n\nThe hip bones on each side usually connect with each other at
    the forward end, and are even solidly fused in lungfishes and sharks, but they
    never attach to the vertebral column.\n\nIn the early tetrapods, this early hip
    bone evolved to become the ischium and pubis, while the ilium formed as a new
    structure, initially somewhat rod-like in form, but soon adding a larger bony
    blade. The acetabulum is already present at the point where the three bones meet.
    \n\nIn these early forms, the connection with the vertebral column is not complete,
    with a small pair of ribs connecting the two structures; nonetheless the pelvis
    already forms the complete ring found in most subsequent forms.\n\nIn practice,
    modern amphibians and reptiles have substantially modified this ancestral structure,
    based on their varied forms and lifestyles. \n\nThe obturator foramen is generally
    very small in such animals, although most reptiles do possess a large gap between
    the pubis and ischium, referred to as the thyroid fenestra, which presents a
    similar appearance to the obturator foramen in mammals. \n\nIn birds, the pubic
    symphysis is present only in the ostrich, and the two hip bones are usually widely
    separated, making it easier to lay large eggs.In therapsids, the hip bone came
    to rotate counter-clockwise, relative to its position in reptiles, so that the
    ilium moved forward, and the pubis and ischium moved to the rear. \n\nThe same
    pattern is seen in all modern mammals, and the thyroid fenestra and obturator
    foramen have merged to form a single space. \n\nThe ilium is typically narrow
    and triangular in mammals, but is much larger in ungulates and humans, in which
    it anchors powerful gluteal muscles. \n\nMonotremes and marsupials also possess
    a fourth pair of bones, the prepubes or \"marsupial bones\", which extend forward
    from the pubes, and help to support the abdominal muscles and, in marsupials,
    the pouch. \n\nIn placental mammals, the pelvis as a whole is generally wider
    in females than in males, to allow for the birth of the young.\n\nThe pelvic
    bones of cetaceans were formerly considered to be vestigial, but they are now
    known to play a role in sexual selection.\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_bone"

  descriptionText: "\n\nMETATARSAL BONES\n\n\nThe metatarsal bones, or metatarsus
    are a group of five long bones in the foot, located between the tarsal bones
    of the hind- and mid-foot and the phalanges of the toes. \n\nLacking individual
    names, the metatarsal bones are numbered from the medial side (the side of the
    great toe): the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth metatarsal (often depicted
    with Roman numerals). \n\nThe metatarsals are analogous to the metacarpal bones
    of the hand. \n\nThe lengths of the metatarsal bones in humans are, in descending
    order: second, third, fourth, fifth and first.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe five
    metatarsals are dorsally convex long bones consisting of a shaft or body, a base
    (proximally), and a head (distally). \n\nThe body is prismoid in form, tapers
    gradually from the tarsal to the phalangeal extremity, and is curved longitudinally,
    so as to be concave below, slightly convex above. \n\nThe base or posterior extremity
    is wedge-shaped, articulating proximally with the tarsal bones, and by its sides
    with the contiguous metatarsal bones: its dorsal and plantar surfaces are rough
    for the attachment of ligaments. \n\nThe head or distal extremity presents a
    convex articular surface, oblong from above downward, and extending farther backward
    below than above. \n\nIts sides are flattened, and on each is a depression, surmounted
    by a tubercle, for ligamentous attachment. \n\nIts plantar surface is grooved
    antero-posteriorly for the passage of the flexor tendons, and marked on either
    side by an articular eminence continuous with the terminal articular surface.\n\nDuring
    growth, the growth plates are located distally on the metatarsals, except on
    the first metatarsal where it is located proximally. \n\nYet it is quite common
    to have an accessory growth plate on the distal first metatarsal.\n\n\n=== Articulations
    ===\n\n\nThe base of each metatarsal bone articulates with one or more of the
    tarsal bones at the tarsometatarsal joints, and the head with one of the first
    row of phalanges at the metatarsophalangeal joints. \n\nTheir bases also articulate
    with each other at the intermetatarsal joints\n\n-The first metatarsal articulates
    with the medial cuneiform, and to a small extent to the intermediate cuneiform.\n-the
    second with all three cuneiforms.\n-the third with the lateral cuneiform.\n-the
    fourth with the lateral cuneiform and the cuboid.\n-The fifth with the cuboid.\n\n\n==
    Clinical significance ==\n\n=== Injuries ===\n\nThe metatarsal bones are often
    broken by association football players. \n\nThese and other recent cases have
    been attributed to the lightweight design of modern football boots, which provide
    less protection to the foot. \n\nIn 2010 some soccer players began testing a
    new sock that incorporated a rubber silicone pad over the foot to provide protection
    to the top of the foot. \n\nStress fractures are thought to account for 16% of
    injuries related to sports participation, and the metatarsals are the bones most
    often involved. \n\nThese fractures are sometimes called march fractures, based
    on their traditional association with military recruits after long marches. \n\nThe
    second and third metatarsals are fixed while walking, thus these metatarsals
    are common sites of injury. \n\nThe fifth metatarsal may be fractured if the
    foot is oversupinated during locomotion.Protection from injuries can be given
    by the use of safety footwear which can use built-in or removable metatarsal
    guards.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metatarsal_bones"

  descriptionText: "\n\nCRICOID CARTILAGE\n\n\nThe cricoid cartilage , or simply
    cricoid (from the Greek krikoeides meaning \"ring-shaped\") or cricoid ring,
    is the only complete ring of cartilage around the trachea. \n\nIt forms the back
    part of the voice box and functions as an attachment site for muscles, cartilages,
    and ligaments involved in opening and closing the airway and in producing speech.\n\n\n==
    Structure ==\n\nThe cricoid cartilage sits just inferior to the thyroid cartilage
    in the neck, at the level of the C6 vertebra, and is joined to it medially by
    the median cricothyroid ligament and postero-laterally by the cricothyroid joints.
    \n\nInferior to it are the rings of cartilage around the trachea (which are not
    continuous \u2013 rather they are C-shaped with a gap posteriorly). \n\nThe cricoid
    is joined to the first tracheal ring by the cricotracheal ligament, and this
    can be felt as a more yielding area between the firm thyroid cartilage and firmer
    cricoid.\n\nIt is also anatomically related to the thyroid gland; although the
    thyroid isthmus is inferior to it, the two lobes of the thyroid extend superiorly
    on each side of the cricoid as far as the thyroid cartilage above it.\n\nThe
    posterior part of the cricoid is slightly broader than the anterior and lateral
    parts, and is called the lamina, while the anterior part is the band; this may
    be the reason for the common comparison made between the cricoid and a signet
    ring. \n\nThe slender ventral half, and the most caudal of the palpable laryngeal
    landmarks, is also referred to as the anterior cricoid arch.\n\n\n=== Composition
    ===\n\nIt is made of hyaline cartilage, and so can become calcified or even ossified,
    particularly in old age.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\nThe function of the cricoid cartilage
    is to provide attachments for the cricothyroid muscle, posterior cricoarytenoid
    muscle and lateral cricoarytenoid muscle muscles, cartilages, and ligaments involved
    in opening and closing the airway and in speech production.\n\n\n== Clinical
    significance ==\n\nWhen intubating a patient under general anesthesia prior to
    surgery, the anesthesiologist will press on the cricoid cartilage to compress
    the esophagus behind it so as to prevent gastric reflux from occurring: this
    is known as the Sellick manoeuvre. \n\nThe Sellick Manoeuvre is typically only
    applied during a Rapid Sequence Induction (RSI), an induction technique reserved
    for those at high risk of aspiration.\nThe Sellick maneuver was considered the
    standard of care during rapid sequence induction for many years. \n\nThe American
    Heart Association still advocates the use of cricoid pressure during resuscitation
    using a BVM, and during emergent oral endotracheal intubation. \n\nHowever, recent
    research increasingly suggests that cricoid pressure may not be as advantageous
    as once thought. \n\nThe initial article by Sellick was based on a small sample
    size at a time when high tidal volumes, head-down positioning, and barbiturate
    anesthesia were the rule.Cricoid pressure may frequently be applied incorrectly.
    \n\nCricoid pressure may frequently displace the esophagus laterally, instead
    of compressing it as described by Sellick. \n\nSeveral studies demonstrate some
    degree of glottic compression reduction in tidal volume and increase in peak
    pressures. \n\nBased on the current literature, the widespread recommendation
    that cricoid pressure be applied during every rapid sequence intubation is quickly
    falling out of favor.\n\nGastric reflux could cause aspiration if this is not
    done considering the general anesthesia can cause relaxation of the gastroesophageal
    sphincter allowing stomach contents to ascend through the esophagus into the
    trachea.\n\nA medical procedure known as a cricoidectomy can be performed in
    which part or all of the cricoid cartilage is removed. \n\nThis is commonly done
    to relieve blockages within the trachea.Fractures of the cricoid cartilage can
    be seen after manual strangulation also known as throttling.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricoid_cartilage"

  descriptionText: "\n\nTALUS (BONE)\n\n\nThe talus (Latin for ankle), talus bone,
    astragalus , or ankle bone is one of the group of foot bones known as the tarsus.
    \n\nThe tarsus forms the lower part of the ankle joint. \n\nIt transmits the
    entire weight of the body from the lower legs to the foot.\n\nThe talus has joints
    with the two bones of the lower leg, the tibia and thinner fibula. \n\nThese
    leg bones have two prominences (the lateral and medial malleoli) that articulate
    with the talus. \n\nAt the foot end, within the tarsus, the talus articulates
    with the calcaneus (heel bone) below, and with the curved navicular bone in front;
    together, these foot articulations form the ball-and-socket-shaped talocalcaneonavicular
    joint. \n\nThe talus is the second largest of the tarsal bones; it is also one
    of the bones in the human body with the highest percentage of its surface area
    covered by articular cartilage. \n\nIt is also unusual in that it has a retrograde
    blood supply, i.e. arterial blood enters the bone at the distal end.\n\nIn humans,
    no muscles attach to the talus, unlike most bones, and its position therefore
    depends on the position of the neighbouring bones.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\n\nThough
    irregular in shape, the talus can be subdivided into three parts.\nFacing anteriorly,
    the head carries the articulate surface of the navicular bone, and the neck,
    the roughened area between the body and the head, has small vascular channels.\n\nThe
    body features several prominent articulate surfaces: On its superior side is
    the trochlea tali, which is semi-cylindrical, and it is flanked by the articulate
    facets for the two malleoli. \n\nThe ankle mortise, the fork-like structure of
    the malleoli, holds these three articulate surfaces in a steady grip, which guarantees
    the stability of the ankle joint. \n\nHowever, because the trochlea is wider
    in front than at the back (approximately 5\u20136 mm) the stability in the joint
    vary with the position of the foot: with the foot dorsiflexed (toes pulled upward)
    the ligaments of the joint are kept stretched, which guarantees the stability
    of the joint; but with the foot plantarflexed (as when standing on the toes)
    the narrower width of the trochlea causes the stability to decrease. \n\nBehind
    the trochlea is a posterior process with a medial and a lateral tubercle separated
    by a groove for the tendon of the flexor hallucis longus. \n\nExceptionally,
    the lateral of these tubercles forms an independent bone called os trigonum or
    accessory talus; it may represent the tarsale proximale intermedium. \n\nOn the
    bone's inferior side, three articular surfaces serve for the articulation with
    the calcaneus, and several variously developed articular surfaces exist for the
    articulation with ligaments.For descriptive purposes the talus bone is divided
    into three sections, neck, body, and head.\n\n\n=== Head ===\n\nThe talus bone
    of the ankle joint connects the leg to the foot.\nThe head of talus looks forward
    and medialward; its anterior articular or navicular surface is large, oval, and
    convex. \n\nIts inferior surface has two facets, which are best seen in the fresh
    condition.\n\nThe medial, situated in front of the middle calcaneal facet, is
    convex, triangular, or semi-oval in shape, and rests on the plantar calcaneonavicular
    ligament; the lateral, named the anterior calcaneal articular surface, is somewhat
    flattened, and articulates with the facet on the upper surface of the anterior
    part of the calcaneus.\n\n\n=== Neck ===\n\nThe neck of talus is directed anteromedially,
    and comprises the constricted portion of the bone between the body and the oval
    head.\n\nIts upper and medial surfaces are rough, for the attachment of ligaments;
    its lateral surface is concave and is continuous below with the deep groove for
    the interosseous talocalcaneal ligament.\n\n\n=== Body ===\n\nThe body of the
    talus comprises most of the volume of the talus bone (ankle bone). \n\nIt presents
    with five surfaces; a superior, inferior, medial, lateral and a posterior:\n   
    \n-The superior surface of the body presents, behind, a smooth trochlear surface,
    the trochlea, for articulation with the tibia. \n\nThe trochlea is broader in
    front than behind, convex from before backward, slightly concave from side to
    side: in front it is continuous with the upper surface of the neck of the bone.\nthe
    inferior surface presents two articular areas, the posterior and middle calcaneal
    surfaces, separated from one another by a deep groove, the sulcus tali. \n\nThe
    groove runs obliquely forward and lateralward, becoming gradually broader and
    deeper in front: in the articulated foot it lies above a similar groove upon
    the upper surface of the calcaneus, and forms, with it, a canal (sinus tarsi)
    filled up in the fresh state by the interosseous talocalcaneal ligament. \n\nThe
    posterior calcaneal articular surface is large and of an oval or oblong form.
    \n\nIt articulates with the corresponding facet on the upper surface of the calcaneus,
    and is deeply concave in the direction of its long axis which runs forward and
    lateralward at an angle of about 45\xB0 with the median plane of the body. \n\nThe
    middle calcaneal articular surface is small, oval in form and slightly convex;
    it articulates with the upper surface of the sustentaculum tali of the calcaneus.\n\n-The
    medial surface presents at its upper part a pear-shaped articular facet for the
    medial malleolus, continuous above with the trochlea; below the articular surface
    is a rough depression for the attachment of the deep portion of the deltoid ligament
    of the ankle-joint.\n\n-The lateral surface carries a large triangular facet,
    concave from above downward, for articulation with the lateral malleolus; its
    anterior half is continuous above with the trochlea; and in front of it is a
    rough depression for the attachment of the anterior talofibular ligament. \n\nBetween
    the posterior half of the lateral border of the trochlea and the posterior part
    of the base of the fibular articular surface is a triangular facet which comes
    into contact with the transverse inferior tibiofibular ligament during flexion
    of the ankle-joint; below the base of this facet is a groove which affords attachment
    to the posterior talofibular ligament.\n\n-The posterior surface is narrow, and
    traversed by a groove running obliquely downward and medialward, and transmitting
    the tendon of the Flexor hallucis longus. \n\nLateral to the groove is a prominent
    tubercle, the posterior process, to which the posterior talofibular ligament
    is attached; this process is sometimes separated from the rest of the talus,
    and is then known as the os trigonum. \n\nMedial to the groove is a second smaller
    tubercle.\n\n\n== Development ==\n\nDuring the 7-8th intrauterine month an ossification
    center is formed in the anklebone.\n\n\n== Fracture ==\n\nThe talus bone lacks
    a good blood supply. \n\nBecause of this, healing a broken talus can take longer
    than most other bones. \n\nOne with a broken talus may not be able to walk for
    many months without crutches and will further wear a walking cast or boot of
    some kind after that.\n\nTalus injuries may be difficult to recognize, and lateral
    process fractures in particular may be radiographically occult. \n\nIf not recognized
    and managed appropriately, a talus fracture may result in complications and long-term
    morbidity. \n\nA 2015 review came to the conclusion that isolated talar body
    fractures may be more common than previously thought.\n\nA fractured talar body
    often has a displacement that is best visualised using CT imaging. \n\nIn case
    a talus fracture is accompanied by a dislocation, restoration of articular and
    axial alignment is necessary to optimize ankle and hindfoot function.\n\n\n==
    As dice ==\n\nDice were originally made from the talus of hoofed animals, leading
    to the nickname \"bones\" for dice. \n\nColloquially known as \"knucklebones\",
    these are approximately tetrahedral. \n\nModern Mongolians still use such bones
    as shagai for games and fortune-telling, with each piece relating to a symbolic
    meaning.\n\n\n== In other animals ==\n\nThe talus apparently derives from the
    fusion of three separate bones in the feet of primitive amphibians; the tibiale,
    articulating with tibia, the intermedium, between the bases of the tibia and
    fibula, and the fourth centrale, lying in the mid-part of the tarsus. \n\nThese
    bones are still partially separate in modern amphibians, which therefore do not
    have a true talus. \n\nThe talus forms a considerably more flexible joint in
    mammals than it does in reptiles. \n\nThis reaches its greatest extent in artiodactyls,
    where the distal surface of the bone has a smooth keel to allow greater freedom
    of movement of the foot, and thus increase running speed.\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talus_bone"

  descriptionText: "\n\nTRIQUETRUM/TRIQUETRAL BONE\n\n\nThe triquetral bone also
    called triquetrum, pyramidal, three-faced, and formerly cuneiform bone) is located
    in the wrist on the medial side of the proximal row of the carpus between the
    lunate and pisiform bones. \n\nIt is on the ulnar side of the hand, but does
    not articulate with the ulna. \n\nIt connects with the pisiform, hamate, and
    lunate bones. \n\nIt is the 3rd most commonly fractured carpal bone.\n\n\n==
    Structure ==\n\nThe triquetral is one of the eight carpal bones of the hand.
    \n\nIt is a three-faced bone found within the proximal row of carpal bones. \n\nSituated
    beneath the pisiform, it is one of the carpal bones that form the carpal arch,
    within which lies the carpal tunnel. \n\nThe triquetral bone may be distinguished
    by its pyramidal shape, and by an oval isolated facet for articulation with the
    pisiform bone. \n\nIt is situated at the upper and ulnar side of the carpus.
    \n\nTo facilitate its palpation in an exam, the hand must be radially deviated
    so that the triquetrium moves out from under the ulnar styloid process. \n\nThe
    triquetrum may be difficult to find, since it also lies under the pisiform.\n\n\n==
    Ossification ==\n\nThe triquetral bone ossifies between 9 months and 50 months
    (4 years and 2 months).\n\n\n=== Surfaces ===\n\nThe superior surface presents
    a medial, rough, non-articular portion, and a lateral convex articular portion
    which articulates with the triangular articular disk of the wrist.\n\nThe inferior
    surface, directed lateralward, is concave, sinuously curved, and smooth for articulation
    with the hamate. \n\nThe dorsal surface is rough for the attachment of ligaments.\nThe
    volar surface presents, on its medial part, an oval facet, for articulation with
    the pisiform; its lateral part is rough for ligamentous attachment.\n\nThe lateral
    surface, the base of the pyramid, is marked by a flat, quadrilateral facet, for
    articulation with the lunate.\n\nThe medial surface, the summit of the pyramid,
    is pointed and roughened, for the attachment of the ulnar collateral ligament
    of the wrist.\n\n\n=== In animals ===\n\nIn reptiles and amphibians, the bone
    is instead referred to as the ulnare, since (at least in the most primitive fossils)
    it articulates with the ulna.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\nThe carpal bones function
    as a unit to provide a bony superstructure for the hand.\n\n\n== Fracture ==\n\nTriquetral
    fractures can occur due to forceful flexion of the wrist, causing an avulsion
    of the dorsal aspect of the bone that is often hidden on anterior radiographs,
    but can be seen as a tiny bone fragment on lateral views.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe
    etymology derives from the Latin triquetrus which means \"three-cornered.\" \n\nTherefore,
    it is sometimes also called the triangular bone or os triangulare. \n\nHowever,
    os triangulare may also refer to a nearby accessory bone.\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triquetral_bone"

  descriptionText: "\n\nFOURTH RIB\n\n\n== Structure of the rib cage ==\n\nRibs are
    described based on their location and connection with the sternum. \n\nAll ribs
    are attached posteriorly to the thoracic vertebrae and are numbered accordingly
    one to twelve. \n\nRibs that articulate directly with the sternum are called
    true ribs, whereas those that do not articulate directly are termed false ribs.
    \n\n\n=== Attachment of the rib cage ===\n\nThe terms true ribs and false ribs
    describe rib pairs that are directly or indirectly attached to the sternum. \n\nThe
    first seven rib pairs known as the fixed or vertebrosternal ribs are the true
    ribs (Latin: costae verae) as they connect directly to the sternum; the next
    five pairs (eighth to twelfth) are the false ribs (Latin: costae spuriae). \n\n\n===
    Parts of rib (general) ===\n\nEach rib consists of a head, neck, and a shaft.
    \n\nAll ribs are attached posteriorly to the thoracic vertebrae. \n\nThey are
    numbered to match the vertebrae they attach to \u2013 one to twelve, from top
    (T1) to bottom. \n\nThe head of the rib is the end part closest to the vertebra
    with which it articulates. \n\nIt is marked by a kidney-shaped articular surface
    which is divided by a horizontal crest into two articulating regions. \n\nThe
    upper region articulates with the inferior costal facet on the vertebra above,
    and the larger region articulates with the superior costal facet on the vertebra
    with the same number. \n\nThe transverse process of a thoracic vertebra also
    articulates at the transverse costal facet with the tubercle of the rib of the
    same number. \n\nThe crest gives attachment to the intra-articular ligament.The
    neck of the rib is the flattened part that extends laterally from the head. \n\nThe
    neck is about 3 cm long. \n\nIts anterior surface is flat and smooth, whilst
    its posterior is perforated by numerous foramina and its surface rough, to give
    attachment to the ligament of the neck. \n\nIts upper border presents a rough
    crest (crista colli costae) for the attachment of the anterior costotransverse
    ligament; its lower border is rounded.\n\nOn the posterior surface at the neck,
    is an eminence\u2014the tubercle that consists of an articular and a non-articular
    portion. \n\nThe articular portion is the lower and more medial of the two and
    presents a small, oval surface for articulation with the transverse costal facet
    on the end of the transverse process of the lower of the two vertebrae to which
    the head is connected. \n\nThe non-articular portion is a rough elevation and
    affords attachment to the ligament of the tubercle. \n\nThe tubercle is much
    more prominent in the upper ribs than in the lower ribs.\n\nThe angle of a rib
    (costal angle) may both refer to the bending part of it, and a prominent line
    in this area, a little in front of the tubercle. \n\nThis line is directed downward
    and laterally; this gives attachment to a tendon of the iliocostalis muscle.
    \n\nAt this point, the rib is bent in two directions, and at the same time twisted
    on its long axis.\n\nThe distance between the angle and the tubercle is progressively
    greater from the second to the tenth ribs. \n\nThe area between the angle and
    the tubercle is rounded, rough, and irregular, and serves for the attachment
    of the longissimus dorsi muscle.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rib_cage"

  descriptionText: "\n\nULNA\n\n\nThe ulna (pl. ulnae or ulnas) is a long bone found
    in the forearm that stretches from the elbow to the smallest finger, and when
    in anatomical position, is found on the medial side of the forearm. \n\nIt runs
    parallel to the radius, the other long bone in the forearm. \n\nThe ulna is usually
    slightly longer than the radius, but the radius is thicker. \n\nTherefore, the
    radius is considered to be the larger of the two.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe
    ulna is a long bone found in the forearm that stretches from the elbow to the
    smallest finger, and when in anatomical position, is found on the medial side
    of the forearm. It is broader close to the elbow, and narrows as it approaches
    the wrist.\n\nClose to the elbow, the ulna has a bony process, the olecranon
    process, a hook-like structure that fits into the olecranon fossa of the humerus.
    \n\nThis prevents hyperextension and forms a hinge joint with the trochlea of
    the humerus. \n\nThere is also a radial notch for the head of the radius, and
    the ulnar tuberosity to which muscles attach.\n\nClose to the wrist, the ulna
    has a styloid process.\n\n\n=== Near the elbow ===\n\nNear the elbow, the ulna
    has two curved processes, the olecranon and the coronoid process; and two concave,
    articular cavities, the semilunar and radial notches.\n\nThe olecranon is a large,
    thick, curved eminence, situated at the upper and back part of the ulna. \n\nIt
    is bent forward at the summit so as to present a prominent lip which is received
    into the olecranon fossa of the humerus in extension of the forearm. \n\nIts
    base is contracted where it joins the body and the narrowest part of the upper
    end of the ulna. \n\nIts posterior surface, directed backward, is triangular,
    smooth, subcutaneous, and covered by a bursa. \n\nIts superior surface is of
    quadrilateral form, marked behind by a rough impression for the insertion of
    the triceps brachii; and in front, near the margin, by a slight transverse groove
    for the attachment of part of the posterior ligament of the elbow joint. \n\nIts
    anterior surface is smooth, concave, and forms the upper part of the semilunar
    notch. \n\nIts borders present continuations of the groove on the margin of the
    superior surface; they serve for the attachment of ligaments: the back part of
    the ulnar collateral ligament medially, and the posterior ligament laterally.
    \n\nFrom the medial border a part of the flexor carpi ulnaris arises; while to
    the lateral border the anconeus is attached.\n\nThe coronoid process is a triangular
    eminence projecting forward from the upper and front part of the ulna. \n\nIts
    base is continuous with the body of the bone, and of considerable strength. \n\nIts
    apex is pointed, slightly curved upward, and in flexion of the forearm is received
    into the coronoid fossa of the humerus. \n\nIts upper surface is smooth, concave,
    and forms the lower part of the semilunar notch. \n\nIts antero-inferior surface
    is concave, and marked by a rough impression for the insertion of the brachialis.
    \n\nAt the junction of this surface with the front of the body is a rough eminence,
    the tuberosity of the ulna, which gives insertion to a part of the brachialis;
    to the lateral border of this tuberosity the oblique cord is attached. \n\nIts
    lateral surface presents a narrow, oblong, articular depression, the radial notch.
    \n\nIts medial surface, by its prominent, free margin, serves for the attachment
    of part of the ulnar collateral ligament. \n\nAt the front part of this surface
    is a small rounded eminence for the origin of one head of the flexor digitorum
    superficialis; behind the eminence is a depression for part of the origin of
    the flexor digitorum profundus; descending from the eminence is a ridge which
    gives origin to one head of the pronator teres. \n\nFrequently, the flexor pollicis
    longus arises from the lower part of the coronoid process by a rounded bundle
    of muscular fibers.\n\nThe semilunar notch is a large depression, formed by the
    olecranon and the coronoid process, and serving as articulation with the trochlea
    of the humerus. \n\nAbout the middle of either side of this notch is an indentation,
    which contracts it somewhat, and indicates the junction of the olecranon and
    the coronoid process. \n\nThe notch is concave from above downward, and divided
    into a medial and a lateral portion by a smooth ridge running from the summit
    of the olecranon to the tip of the coronoid process. The medial portion is the
    larger, and is slightly concave transversely; the lateral is convex above, slightly
    concave below.\n\nThe radial notch is a narrow, oblong, articular depression
    on the lateral side of the coronoid process; it receives the circumferential
    articular surface of the head of the radius. \n\nIt is concave from before backward,
    and its prominent extremities serve for the attachment of the annular ligament.\n\n\n===
    Body ===\n\nThe body of the ulna at its upper part is prismatic in form, and
    curved so as to be convex behind and lateralward; its central part is straight;
    its lower part is rounded, smooth, and bent a little lateralward. \n\nIt tapers
    gradually from above downward, and has three borders and three surfaces.\n\n===Borders===\n\nThe
    volar border (margo volaris; anterior border) begins above at the prominent medial
    angle of the coronoid process, and ends below in front of the styloid process.
    \n\nIts upper part, well-defined, and its middle portion, smooth and rounded,
    give origin to the flexor digitorum profundus; its lower fourth serves for the
    origin of the pronator quadratus. \n\nThis border separates the volar from the
    medial surface.\n\nThe dorsal border (margo dorsalis; posterior border) begins
    above at the apex of the triangular subcutaneous surface at the back part of
    the olecranon, and ends below at the back of the styloid process; it is well-marked
    in the upper three-fourths, and gives attachment to an aponeurosis which affords
    a common origin to the flexor carpi ulnaris, the extensor carpi ulnaris, and
    the flexor digitorum profundus; its lower fourth is smooth and rounded. \n\nThis
    border separates the medial from the dorsal surface.\n\nThe interosseous crest
    (crista interossea; external or interosseous border) begins above by the union
    of two lines, which converge from the extremities of the radial notch and enclose
    between them a triangular space for the origin of part of the Supinator; it ends
    below at the head of the ulna. \n\nIts upper part is sharp, its lower fourth
    smooth and rounded. \n\nThis crest gives attachment to the interosseous membrane,
    and separates the volar from the dorsal surface.\n\n===Surfaces===\n\nThe volar
    surface (facies volaris; anterior surface), much broader above than below, is
    concave in its upper three-fourths, and gives origin to the flexor digitorum
    profundus; its lower fourth, also concave, is covered by the pronator quadratus.
    The lower fourth is separated from the remaining portion by a ridge, directed
    obliquely downward and medialward, which marks the extent of origin of the pronator
    quadratus. \n\nAt the junction of the upper with the middle third of the bone
    is the nutrient canal, directed obliquely upward.\n\nThe dorsal surface (facies
    dorsalis; posterior surface) directed backward and lateralward, is broad and
    concave above; convex and somewhat narrower in the middle; narrow, smooth, and
    rounded below. \n\nOn its upper part is an oblique ridge, which runs from the
    dorsal end of the radial notch, downward to the dorsal border; the triangular
    surface above this ridge receives the insertion of the Ancon\xE6us, while the
    upper part of the ridge affords attachment to the supinator. \n\nBelow this the
    surface is subdivided by a longitudinal ridge, sometimes called the perpendicular
    line, into two parts: the medial part is smooth, and covered by the extensor
    carpi ulnaris; the lateral portion, wider and rougher, gives origin from above
    downward to the Supinator, the abductor pollicis longus, the extensor pollicis
    longus, and the extensor indicis proprius.\n\nThe medial surface (facies medialis;
    internal surface) is broad and concave above, narrow and convex below. \n\nIts
    upper three-fourths give origin to the Flexor digitorum profundus; its lower
    fourth is subcutaneous.\n\n\n=== Near the wrist ===\n\nThe head of ulna presents
    an articular surface, part of which, of an oval or semilunar form, is directed
    downward, and articulates with the upper surface of the triangular articular
    disc which separates it from the wrist-joint; the remaining portion, directed
    lateralward, is narrow, convex, and received into the ulnar notch of the radius.\n\nNear
    the wrist, the ulnar, with two eminences; the lateral and larger is a rounded,
    articular eminence, termed the head of the ulna; the medial, narrower and more
    projecting, is a non-articular eminence, the styloid process.\n\nThe head presents
    an articular surface, part of which, of an oval or semilunar form, is directed
    downward, and articulates with the upper surface of the triangular articular
    disk which separates it from the wrist-joint; the remaining portion, directed
    lateralward, is narrow, convex, and received into the ulnar notch of the radius.\n\nThe
    styloid process projects from the medial and back part of the bone; it descends
    a little lower than the head, and its rounded end affords attachment to the ulnar
    collateral ligament of the wrist-joint.\n\nThe head is separated from the styloid
    process by a depression for the attachment of the apex of the triangular articular
    disk, and behind, by a shallow groove for the tendon of the extensor carpi ulnaris.\n\n\t\t\n===
    Microanatomy ===\n\nThe ulna is a long bone. \n\nThe long, narrow medullary cavity
    of the ulna is enclosed in a strong wall of cortical tissue which is thickest
    along the interosseous border and dorsal surface. At the extremities the compact
    layer thins.\n\nThe compact layer is continued onto the back of the olecranon
    as a plate of close spongy bone with lamell\xE6 parallel. \n\nFrom the inner
    surface of this plate and the compact layer below it trabecul\xE6 arch forward
    toward the olecranon and coronoid and cross other trabecul\xE6, passing backward
    over the medullary cavity from the upper part of the shaft below the coronoid.
    Below the coronoid process there is a small area of compact bone from which trabecul\xE6
    curve upward to end obliquely to the surface of the semilunar notch which is
    coated with a thin layer of compact bone.\n\nThe trabecul\xE6 at the lower end
    have a more longitudinal direction.\n\n\n=== Development ===\n\nThe ulna is ossified
    from three centers: one each for the body, the wrist end, and the elbow end,
    near the top of the olecranon. \n\nOssification begins near the middle of the
    body of the ulna, about the eighth week of fetal life, and soon extends through
    the greater part of the bone.\n\nAt birth, the ends are cartilaginous. \n\nAbout
    the fourth year or so, a center appears in the middle of the head, and soon extends
    into the ulnar styloid process. \n\nAbout the tenth year, a center appears in
    the olecranon near its extremity, the chief part of this process being formed
    by an upward extension of the body. \n\nThe upper epiphysis joins the body about
    the sixteenth, the lower about the twentieth year.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\n\n===
    Joints ===\n\nThe ulna forms part of the wrist joint and elbow joints. \n\nSpecifically,
    the ulna joins (articulates) with:\n\n-trochlea of the humerus, at the right
    side elbow as a hinge joint with semilunar trochlear notch of the ulna.\n-the
    radius, near the elbow as a pivot joint, this allows the radius to cross over
    the ulna in pronation.\n-the distal radius, where it fits into the ulnar notch.\n-the
    radius along its length via the interosseous membrane that forms a syndesmosis
    joint\n\n\n=== Muscle attachments ===\n\n\n== Clinical significance ==\n\n\n===
    Fractures ===\n\nSpecific types of ulna fracture include:\n\n-Monteggia fracture
    - a fracture of the proximal third of the ulna with the dislocation of the head
    of the radius\n-Hume fracture - a fracture of the olecranon with an associated
    anterior dislocation of the radial headConservative management is possible for
    ulnar fractures when they are located in the distal two-thirds, only involve
    the shaft, with no shortening, less than 10\xB0 angulation and less than 50%
    displacement. \n\nIn such cases, a cast should be applied that goes above the
    elbow.\n\n\n== Other animals ==\n\nIn four-legged animals, the radius is the
    main load-bearing bone of the lower forelimb, and the ulna is important primarily
    for muscular attachment. \n\nIn many mammals, the ulna is partially or wholly
    fused with the radius, and may therefore not exist as a separate bone. \n\nHowever,
    even in extreme cases of fusion, such as in horses, the olecranon process is
    still present, albeit as a projection from the upper radius.\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulna"

  descriptionText: "\n\nTENTH RIB\n\n\n== Structure of the rib cage ==\n\nRibs are
    described based on their location and connection with the sternum. \n\nAll ribs
    are attached posteriorly to the thoracic vertebrae and are numbered accordingly
    one to twelve. \n\nRibs that articulate directly with the sternum are called
    true ribs, whereas those that do not articulate directly are termed false ribs.
    \n\n\n=== Attachment of the rib cage ===\n\nThe terms true ribs and false ribs
    describe rib pairs that are directly or indirectly attached to the sternum. \n\nThe
    first seven rib pairs known as the fixed or vertebrosternal ribs are the true
    ribs (Latin: costae verae) as they connect directly to the sternum; the next
    five pairs (eighth to twelfth) are the false ribs (Latin: costae spuriae). \n\n\n===
    Parts of rib (general) ===\n\nEach rib consists of a head, neck, and a shaft.
    \n\nAll ribs are attached posteriorly to the thoracic vertebrae. \n\nThey are
    numbered to match the vertebrae they attach to \u2013 one to twelve, from top
    (T1) to bottom. \n\nThe head of the rib is the end part closest to the vertebra
    with which it articulates. \n\nIt is marked by a kidney-shaped articular surface
    which is divided by a horizontal crest into two articulating regions. \n\nThe
    upper region articulates with the inferior costal facet on the vertebra above,
    and the larger region articulates with the superior costal facet on the vertebra
    with the same number. \n\nThe transverse process of a thoracic vertebra also
    articulates at the transverse costal facet with the tubercle of the rib of the
    same number. \n\nThe crest gives attachment to the intra-articular ligament.The
    neck of the rib is the flattened part that extends laterally from the head. \n\nThe
    neck is about 3 cm long. \n\nIts anterior surface is flat and smooth, whilst
    its posterior is perforated by numerous foramina and its surface rough, to give
    attachment to the ligament of the neck. \n\nIts upper border presents a rough
    crest (crista colli costae) for the attachment of the anterior costotransverse
    ligament; its lower border is rounded.\n\nOn the posterior surface at the neck,
    is an eminence\u2014the tubercle that consists of an articular and a non-articular
    portion. \n\nThe articular portion is the lower and more medial of the two and
    presents a small, oval surface for articulation with the transverse costal facet
    on the end of the transverse process of the lower of the two vertebrae to which
    the head is connected. \n\nThe non-articular portion is a rough elevation and
    affords attachment to the ligament of the tubercle. \n\nThe tubercle is much
    more prominent in the upper ribs than in the lower ribs.\n\nThe angle of a rib
    (costal angle) may both refer to the bending part of it, and a prominent line
    in this area, a little in front of the tubercle. \n\nThis line is directed downward
    and laterally; this gives attachment to a tendon of the iliocostalis muscle.
    \n\nAt this point, the rib is bent in two directions, and at the same time twisted
    on its long axis.\n\nThe distance between the angle and the tubercle is progressively
    greater from the second to the tenth ribs. \n\nThe area between the angle and
    the tubercle is rounded, rough, and irregular, and serves for the attachment
    of the longissimus dorsi muscle.\n\n\n==== Ribs and vertebrae ====\n\nThe first
    rib (the topmost one) is the most curved and usually the shortest of all the
    ribs; it is broad and flat, its surfaces looking upward and downward, and its
    borders inward and outward.\n        \nThe head is small and rounded, and possesses
    only a single articular facet, for articulation with the body of the first thoracic
    vertebra. \n\nThe neck is narrow and rounded. \n\nThe tubercle, thick and prominent,
    is placed on the outer border. \n\nIt bears a small facet for articulation with
    the transverse costal facet on the transverse process of T1. \n\nThere is no
    angle, but at the tubercle, the rib is slightly bent, with the convexity upward,
    so that the head of the bone is directed downward. \n\nThe upper surface of the
    body is marked by two shallow grooves, separated from each other by a slight
    ridge prolonged internally into a tubercle, the scalene tubercle, for the attachment
    of the anterior scalene; the anterior groove transmits the subclavian vein, the
    posterior the subclavian artery and the lowest trunk of the brachial plexus.
    \n\nBehind the posterior groove is a rough area for the attachment of the medial
    scalene. \n\nThe under surface is smooth and without a costal groove. \n\nThe
    outer border is convex, thick, and rounded, and at its posterior part gives attachment
    to the first digitation of the serratus anterior. \n\nThe inner border is concave,
    thin, and sharp, and marked about its center by the scalene tubercle. \n\nThe
    anterior extremity is larger and thicker than that of any of the other ribs.\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rib_cage"

  descriptionText: "\n\nINCISOR\n\n\nIncisors (from Latin incidere, \"to cut\") are
    the front teeth present in most mammals. \n\nThey are located in the premaxilla
    above and on the mandible below. \n\nHumans have a total of eight (two on each
    side, top and bottom). \n\nOpossums have 18, whereas armadillos have none.\n\n\n==
    Structure ==\n\nAdult humans normally have eight incisors, two of each type.
    \n\nThe types of incisor are:\n\nmaxillary central incisor (upper jaw, closest
    to the center of the lips)\nmaxillary lateral incisor (upper jaw, beside the
    maxillary central incisor)\nmandibular central incisor (lower jaw, closest to
    the center of the lips)\nmandibular lateral incisor (lower jaw, beside the mandibular
    central incisor)Children with a full set of deciduous teeth (primary teeth) also
    have eight incisors, named the same way as in permanent teeth. \n\nYoung children
    may have from zero to eight incisors depending on the stage of their tooth eruption
    and tooth development. \n\nTypically, the mandibular central incisors erupt first,
    followed by the maxillary central incisors, the mandibular lateral incisors and
    finally the maxillary laterals. \n\nThe rest of the primary dentition erupts
    after the incisors.Apart from the first molars, the incisors are also the first
    permanent teeth to erupt, following the same order as the primary teeth, among
    themselves.\n\n\n=== Other animals ===\n\nAmong other animals, the number varies
    from species to species. \n\nOpossums have 18, whereas armadillos have none.
    \n\nCats, dogs, foxes, pigs, and horses have twelve. \n\nRodents have four. \n\nRabbits
    and hares (lagomorphs) were once considered rodents, but are distinguished by
    having six\u2014one small pair, called \"peg teeth\", is located directly behind
    the most anterior pair. \n\nIncisors are used to bite off tough foods, such as
    red meat.\nCattle (cows, bulls, etc.) have none on top but a total of six on
    the bottom.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\nIn cats, the incisors are small; biting off
    meat is done with the canines and the carnassials. \n\nIn elephants, the upper
    incisors are modified into curved tusks (unlike with Narwhals, where it is a
    canine that develops into a straight and twisted tusk). \n\nThe incisors of rodents
    grow throughout life and are worn by gnawing. \n\nIn humans, the incisors serve
    to cut off pieces of food, as well as in the grip of other food items.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incisor"

  descriptionText: "\n\nMETATARSAL BONES\n\n\nThe metatarsal bones, or metatarsus
    are a group of five long bones in the foot, located between the tarsal bones
    of the hind- and mid-foot and the phalanges of the toes. \n\nLacking individual
    names, the metatarsal bones are numbered from the medial side (the side of the
    great toe): the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth metatarsal (often depicted
    with Roman numerals). \n\nThe metatarsals are analogous to the metacarpal bones
    of the hand. \n\nThe lengths of the metatarsal bones in humans are, in descending
    order: second, third, fourth, fifth and first.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe five
    metatarsals are dorsally convex long bones consisting of a shaft or body, a base
    (proximally), and a head (distally). \n\nThe body is prismoid in form, tapers
    gradually from the tarsal to the phalangeal extremity, and is curved longitudinally,
    so as to be concave below, slightly convex above. \n\nThe base or posterior extremity
    is wedge-shaped, articulating proximally with the tarsal bones, and by its sides
    with the contiguous metatarsal bones: its dorsal and plantar surfaces are rough
    for the attachment of ligaments. \n\nThe head or distal extremity presents a
    convex articular surface, oblong from above downward, and extending farther backward
    below than above. \n\nIts sides are flattened, and on each is a depression, surmounted
    by a tubercle, for ligamentous attachment. \n\nIts plantar surface is grooved
    antero-posteriorly for the passage of the flexor tendons, and marked on either
    side by an articular eminence continuous with the terminal articular surface.\n\nDuring
    growth, the growth plates are located distally on the metatarsals, except on
    the first metatarsal where it is located proximally. \n\nYet it is quite common
    to have an accessory growth plate on the distal first metatarsal.\n\n\n=== Articulations
    ===\n\n\nThe base of each metatarsal bone articulates with one or more of the
    tarsal bones at the tarsometatarsal joints, and the head with one of the first
    row of phalanges at the metatarsophalangeal joints. \n\nTheir bases also articulate
    with each other at the intermetatarsal joints\n\n-The first metatarsal articulates
    with the medial cuneiform, and to a small extent to the intermediate cuneiform.\n-the
    second with all three cuneiforms.\n-the third with the lateral cuneiform.\n-the
    fourth with the lateral cuneiform and the cuboid.\n-The fifth with the cuboid.\n\n\n==
    Clinical significance ==\n\n=== Injuries ===\n\nThe metatarsal bones are often
    broken by association football players. \n\nThese and other recent cases have
    been attributed to the lightweight design of modern football boots, which provide
    less protection to the foot. \n\nIn 2010 some soccer players began testing a
    new sock that incorporated a rubber silicone pad over the foot to provide protection
    to the top of the foot. \n\nStress fractures are thought to account for 16% of
    injuries related to sports participation, and the metatarsals are the bones most
    often involved. \n\nThese fractures are sometimes called march fractures, based
    on their traditional association with military recruits after long marches. \n\nThe
    second and third metatarsals are fixed while walking, thus these metatarsals
    are common sites of injury. \n\nThe fifth metatarsal may be fractured if the
    foot is oversupinated during locomotion.\n\nProtection from injuries can be given
    by the use of safety footwear which can use built-in or removable metatarsal
    guards.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metatarsal_bones"

    anatomy, the five vertebrae between the rib cage and the pelvis. \n\nThey are
    the largest segments of the vertebral column and are characterized by the absence
    of the foramen transversarium within the transverse process (since it is only
    found in the cervical region) and by the absence of facets on the sides of the
    body (as found only in the thoracic region). \n\nThey are designated L1 to L5,
    starting at the top. \n\nThe lumbar vertebrae help support the weight of the
    body, and permit movement.\n\n\n== Human anatomy ==\n\n=== General characteristics
    ===\n\nThe figure on the left depicts the general characteristics of the first
    through fourth lumbar vertebrae. \n\nThe fifth vertebra contains certain peculiarities,
    which are detailed below.\n\nAs with other vertebrae, each lumbar vertebra consists
    of a vertebral body and a vertebral arch. \n\nThe vertebral arch, consisting
    of a pair of pedicles and a pair of laminae, encloses the vertebral foramen (opening)
    and supports seven processes.\n\n\n==== Body ====\n\nThe vertebral body of each
    lumbar vertebra is kidney shaped, wider from side to side than from front to
    back, and a little thicker in front than in back. \n\nIt is flattened or slightly
    concave above and below, concave behind, and deeply constricted in front and
    at the sides.\n\n\n==== Arch ====\n\nThe pedicles are very strong, directed backward
    from the upper part of the vertebral body; consequently, the inferior vertebral
    notches are of considerable depth. \n\nThe pedicles change in morphology from
    the upper lumbar to the lower lumbar. \n\nThey increase in sagittal width from
    9 mm to up to 18 mm at L5. \n\nThey increase in angulation in the axial plane
    from 10 degrees to 20 degrees by L5. \n\nThe pedicle is sometimes used as a portal
    of entrance into the vertebral body for fixation with pedicle screws or for placement
    of bone cement as with kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty.\n\nThe laminae are broad,
    short, and strong. \n\nThey form the posterior portion of the vertebral arch.
    \n\nIn the upper lumbar region the lamina are taller than wide but in the lower
    lumbar vertebra the lamina are wider than tall. \n\nThe lamina connects the spinous
    process to the pedicles.\nThe vertebral foramen within the arch is triangular,
    larger than the thoracic vertebrae, but smaller than in the cervical vertebrae.\n\n\n====
    Processes ====\n\nThe spinous process is thick, broad, and somewhat quadrilateral;
    it projects backward and ends in a rough, uneven border, thickest below where
    it is occasionally notched.The superior and inferior articular processes are
    well-defined, projecting respectively upward and downward from the junctions
    of pedicles and laminae. \n\nThe facets on the superior processes are concave,
    and look backward and medialward; those on the inferior are convex, and are directed
    forward and lateralward. \n\nThe former are wider apart than the latter since
    in the articulated column, the inferior articular processes are embraced by the
    superior processes of the subjacent vertebra.The transverse processes are long
    and slender. \n\nThey are horizontal in the upper three lumbar vertebrae and
    incline a little upward in the lower two. \n\nIn the upper three vertebrae they
    arise from the junctions of the pedicles and laminae, but in the lower two they
    are set farther forward and spring from the pedicles and posterior parts of the
    vertebral bodies. \n\nThey are situated in front of the articular processes instead
    of behind them as in the thoracic vertebrae, and are homologous with the ribs.\n\nThree
    portions or tubercles can be noticed in a transverse process of a lower lumbar
    vertebrae: the lateral or costiform process, the mammillary process, and the
    accessory process. \n\nThe costiform is lateral, the mammillary is superior (cranial),
    and the accessory is inferior (caudal). \n\nThe mammillary is connected in the
    lumbar region with the back part of the superior articular process. \n\nThe accessory
    process is situated at the back part of the base of the transverse process. \n\nThe
    tallest and thickest costiform process is usually that of L5.\n\n\n=== First
    and fifth lumbar vertebrae ===\n\n\nThe first lumbar vertebra is level with the
    anterior end of the ninth rib. \n\nThis level is also called the important transpyloric
    plane, since the pylorus of the stomach is at this level. \n\nOther important
    structures are also located at this level, they include; fundus of the gall bladder,
    celiac trunk, superior mesenteric artery, termination of spinal cord, beginning
    of filum terminalis, renal vessels, middle suprarenal arteries, and hila of kidneys.\n\nThe
    fifth lumbar vertebra is characterized by its body being much deeper in front
    than behind, which accords with the prominence of the sacrovertebral articulation;
    by the smaller size of its spinous process; by the wide interval between the
    inferior articular processes, and by the thickness of its transverse processes,
    which spring from the body as well as from the pedicles.\n\nThe fifth lumbar
    vertebra is by far the most common site of spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis.Most
    individuals have five lumbar vertebrae, while some have four or six. \n\nLumbar
    disorders that normally affect L5 will affect L4 or L6 in these latter individuals.\n\n\n===
    Segmental movements ===\n\nThe range of segmental movements in a single segment
    is difficult to measure clinically, not only because of variations between individuals,
    but also because it is age and sex dependent. \n\nFurthermore, flexion and extension
    in the lumbal spine is the product of a combination of rotation and translation
    in the sagittal plane between each vertebra.Ranges of segmental movements in
    the lumbar spine (White and Punjabi, 1990) are (in degrees):\n\n\n=== Congenital
    anomalies ===\n\nCongenital vertebral anomalies can cause compression of the
    spinal cord by deforming the vertebral canal or causing instability.\n\n\n==
    Other animals ==\n\nAfrican apes have three and four lumbar vertebrae, (bonobos
    have longer spines with an additional vertebra) and humans normally five. \n\nThis
    difference, and because the lumbar spines of the extinct Nacholapithecus (a Miocene
    hominoid with six lumbar vertebrae and no tail) are similar to those of early
    Australopithecus and early Homo, it is assumed that the Chimpanzee-human last
    common ancestor also had a long vertebral column with a long lumbar region and
    that the reduction in the number of lumbar vertebrae evolved independently in
    each ape clade.\n\nThe limited number of lumbar vertebrae in chimpanzees and
    gorillas result in an inability to lordose (curve) their lumbar spines, in contrast
    to the spines of Old World monkeys and Nacholapithecus and Proconsul, which suggests
    that the last common ancestor was not \"short-backed\" as previously believed.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumbar_vertebrae"

  descriptionText: "\n\nSECOND RIB\n\n\nThe second rib is the second uppermost rib
    in humans or second most frontal in animals that walk on four limbs. \n\nIn humans,
    the second rib is defined as a true rib since it connects with the sternum through
    the intervention of the costal cartilage anteriorly (at the front). \n\nPosteriorly,
    the second rib is connected with the vertebral column by the second thoracic
    vertebra. \n\nThe second rib is much longer than the first rib, but has a very
    similar curvature. \n\nThe non-articular portion of the tubercle is occasionally
    only feebly marked. \n\nThe angle is slight and situated close to the tubercle.
    \n\nThe body is not twisted so that both ends touch any plane surface upon which
    it may be laid; but there is a bend, with its convexity upward, similar to, though
    smaller than that found in the first rib. \n\nThe body is not flattened horizontally
    like that of the first rib. \n\nIts external surface is convex, and looks upward
    and a little outward; near the middle of it is a rough eminence for the origin
    of the lower part of the first and the whole of the second digitation of the
    serratus anterior; behind and above this is attached the posterior scalene. \n\nThe
    internal surface, smooth, and concave, is directed downward and a little inward:
    on its posterior part there is a short costal groove between the ridge of the
    internal surface of the rib and the inferior border. \n\nIt protects the intercostal
    space containing the intercostal veins, intercostal arteries, and intercostal
    nerves."

  descriptionText: "\n\nHUMERUS\n\n\nThe humerus (plural: humeri) is a long bone
    in the arm that runs from the shoulder to the elbow. \n\nIt connects the scapula
    and the two bones of the lower arm, the radius and ulna, and consists of three
    sections. \n\nThe humeral upper extremity consists of a rounded head, a narrow
    neck, and two short processes (tubercles, sometimes called tuberosities). \n\nThe
    body is cylindrical in its upper portion, and more prismatic below. The lower
    extremity consists of 2 epicondyles, 2 processes (trochlea & capitulum), and
    3 fossae (radial fossa, coronoid fossa, and olecranon fossa). \n\nAs well as
    its true anatomical neck, the constriction below the greater and lesser tubercles
    of the humerus is referred to as its surgical neck due to its tendency to fracture,
    thus often becoming the focus of surgeons.\n\n\n=== Upper extremity ===\n\nThe
    upper or proximal extremity of the humerus consists of the bone's large rounded
    head joined to the body by a constricted portion called the neck, and two eminences,
    the greater and lesser tubercles.\n\n\n==== Head ====\n\nThe head (caput humeri),
    is nearly hemispherical in form. It is directed upward, medialward, and a little
    backward, and articulates with the glenoid cavity of the scapula to form the
    glenohumeral joint (shoulder joint). \n\nThe circumference of its articular surface
    is slightly constricted and is termed the anatomical neck, in contradistinction
    to a constriction below the tubercles called the surgical neck which is frequently
    the seat of fracture. \n\nFracture of the anatomical neck rarely occurs.\n\nThe
    diameter of the humeral head is generally larger in men than in women.\n\n\n====
    Anatomical neck ====\n\nThe anatomical neck (collum anatomicum) is obliquely
    directed, forming an obtuse angle with the body. \n\nIt is best marked in the
    lower half of its circumference; in the upper half it is represented by a narrow
    groove separating the head from the tubercles. \n\nThe line separating the head
    from the rest of the upper end is called the anatomical neck. \n\nIt affords
    attachment to the articular capsule of the shoulder-joint, and is perforated
    by numerous vascular foramina. Fracture of the anatomical neck rarely occurs.\n\nThe
    anatomical neck of the humerus is an indentation distal to the head of the humerus
    on which the articular capsule attaches.\n\n\n==== Surgical neck ====\n\nThe
    surgical neck is a narrow area distal to the tubercles that is a common site
    of fracture.\n\nIt makes contact with the axillary nerve and the posterior humeral
    circumflex artery.\n\n\n==== Greater tubercle ====\n\nThe greater tubercle (tuberculum
    majus; greater tuberosity) is a large, posteriorly placed projection that is
    placed laterally. \n\nThe greater tubercle is where supraspinatus, infraspinatus
    and teres minor muscles are attached. \n\nThe crest of the greater tubercle forms
    the lateral lip of the bicipital groove and is the site for insertion of pectoralis
    major.\n\nThe greater tubercle is just lateral to the anatomical neck.\n\nIts
    upper surface is rounded and marked by three flat impressions: the highest of
    these gives insertion to the supraspinatus muscle; the middle to the infraspinatus
    muscle; the lowest one, and the body of the bone for about 2.5 cm. below it,
    to the teres minor muscle. \n\nThe lateral surface of the greater tubercle is
    convex, rough, and continuous with the lateral surface of the body.\n\n\n====
    Lesser tubercle ====\n\nThe lesser tubercle (tuberculum minus; lesser tuberosity)
    is smaller, anterolaterally placed to the head of the humerus. \n\nThe lesser
    tubercle provides insertion to subscapularis muscle. \n\nBoth these tubercles
    are found in the proximal part of the shaft. \n\nThe crest of the lesser tubercle
    forms the medial lip of the bicipital groove and is the site for insertion of
    teres major and latissimus dorsi muscles.\n\nThe lesser tuberosity, is more prominent
    than the greater: it is situated in front, and is directed medialward and forward.
    \n\nAbove and in front it presents an impression for the insertion of the tendon
    of the subscapularis muscle.\n\n\n==== Bicipital groove ====\n\nThe tubercles
    are separated from each other by a deep groove, the bicipital groove (intertubercular
    groove; bicipital sulcus), which lodges the long tendon of the biceps brachii
    muscle and transmits a branch of the anterior humeral circumflex artery to the
    shoulder-joint. \n\nIt runs obliquely downward, and ends near the junction of
    the upper with the middle third of the bone. \n\nIn the fresh state its upper
    part is covered with a thin layer of cartilage, lined by a prolongation of the
    synovial membrane of the shoulder-joint; its lower portion gives insertion to
    the tendon of the latissimus dorsi muscle. \n\nIt is deep and narrow above, and
    becomes shallow and a little broader as it descends. \n\nIts lips are called,
    respectively, the crests of the greater and lesser tubercles (bicipital ridges),
    and form the upper parts of the anterior and medial borders of the body of the
    bone.\n\n\n=== Shaft ===\n\nThe body or shaft of the humerus is triangular to
    cylindrical in cut section and is compressed anteroposteriorly. It has 3 surfaces,
    namely:\n\nAnterolateral surface: the area between the lateral border of the
    humerus to the line drawn as a continuation of the crest of the greater tubercle.
    \n\nThe antero-lateral surface is directed lateralward above, where it is smooth,
    rounded, and covered by the deltoid muscle; forward and lateralward below, where
    it is slightly concave from above downward, and gives origin to part of the Brachialis.
    \n\nAbout the middle of this surface is a rough, rectangular elevation, the deltoid
    tuberosity for the insertion of the deltoid muscle; below this is the radial
    sulcus, directed obliquely from behind, forward, and downward, and transmitting
    the radial nerve and profunda artery.\n\n\nAnteromedial surface: the area between
    the medial border of the humerus to the line drawn as a continuation of the crest
    of the greater tubercle. \n\nThe antero-medial surface, less extensive than the
    antero-lateral, is directed medialward above, forward and medialward below; its
    upper part is narrow, and forms the floor of the intertubercular groove which
    gives insertion to the tendon of the latissimus dorsi muscle; its middle part
    is slightly rough for the attachment of some of the fibers of the tendon of insertion
    of the coracobrachialis muscle; its lower part is smooth, concave from above
    downward, and gives origin to the brachialis muscle.\n\nPosterior surface: the
    area between the medial and lateral borders. \n\nThe posterior surface appears
    somewhat twisted, so that its upper part is directed a little medialward, its
    lower part backward and a little lateralward. \n\nNearly the whole of this surface
    is covered by the lateral and medial heads of the Triceps brachii, the former
    arising above, the latter below the radial sulcus.\n\nIts three borders are:\n\nAnterior
    border of humerus: \n    the anterior border runs from the front of the greater
    tubercle above to the coronoid fossa below, separating the antero-medial from
    the antero-lateral surface. \n\nIts upper part is a prominent ridge, the crest
    of the greater tubercle; it serves for the insertion of the tendon of the pectoralis
    major muscle. \n\nAbout its center it forms the anterior boundary of the deltoid
    tuberosity, on which the deltoid muscle attaches; below, it is smooth and rounded,
    affording attachment to the brachialis muscle.\n\nLateral border of humerus:
    \n    the lateral border runs from the back part of the greater tubercle to the
    lateral epicondyle, and separates the anterolateral from the posterior surface.
    \n\nIts upper half is rounded and indistinctly marked, serving for the attachment
    of the lower part of the insertion of the teres minor muscle, and below this
    giving origin to the lateral head of the triceps brachii muscle; its center is
    traversed by a broad but shallow oblique depression, the spiral groove (musculospiral
    groove). \n\nThe radial nerve runs in the spiral groove.  \n\nIts lower part
    forms a prominent, rough margin, a little curved from backward, forward the lateral
    supracondylar ridge, which presents an anterior lip for the origin of the brachioradialis
    muscle above, and extensor carpi radialis longus muscle above, a posterior lip
    for the triceps brachii muscle, and an intermediate ridge for the attachment
    of the lateral intermuscular septum.\n\nMedial border of humerus: \n    the medial
    border extends from the lesser tubercle to the medial epicondyle. \n\nIts upper
    third consists of a prominent ridge, the crest of the lesser tubercle, which
    gives insertion to the tendon of the teres major muscle. \n\nAbout its center
    is a slight impression for the insertion of the coracobrachialis muscle, and
    just below this is the entrance of the nutrient canal, directed downward; sometimes
    there is a second nutrient canal at the commencement of the radial sulcus. \n\nThe
    inferior third of this border is raised into a slight ridge, the medial supracondylar
    ridge, which became very prominent below; it presents an anterior lip for the
    origins of the brachialis muscle and the pronator teres muscle, a posterior lip
    for the medial head of the triceps brachii muscle, and an intermediate ridge
    for the attachment of the medial intermuscular septum.\n\nThe Deltoid tuberosity
    is a roughened surface on the lateral surface of the shaft of the Humerus and
    acts as the site of insertion of deltoideus muscle. \n\nThe posteror superior
    part of the shaft has a crest, beginning just below the surgical neck of the
    humerus and extends till the superior tip of the deltoid tuberosity. This is
    where the lateral head of triceps brachii  is attached.\n\nThe radial sulcus,
    also known as the spiral groove is found on the posterior surface of the shaft
    and is a shallow oblique groove through which the radial nerve passes along with
    deep vessels. \n\nThis is located posteroinferior to the deltoid tuberosity.
    The inferior boundary of the spiral groove is continuous distally with the lateral
    border of the shaft.\n\nThe nutrient foramen of the humerus is located in the
    anteromedial surface of the humerus. The nutrient arteries enter the humerus
    through this foramen.\n\n\n=== Distal humerus ===\n\nThe distal or lower extremity
    of the humerus is flattened from before backward, and curved slightly forward;
    it ends below in a broad, articular surface, which is divided into two parts
    by a slight ridge. \n\nProjecting on either side are the lateral and medial epicondyles.\n\n\n====
    Articular surface ====\n\nThe articular surface extends a little lower than the
    epicondyles, and is curved slightly forward; its medial extremity occupies a
    lower level than the lateral. \n\nThe lateral portion of this surface consists
    of a smooth, rounded eminence, named the capitulum of the humerus; it articulates
    with the cup-shaped depression on the head of the radius, and is limited to the
    front and lower part of the bone.\n\n\n=== Fossae ===\n\nAbove the front part
    of the trochlea is a small depression, the coronoid fossa, which receives the
    coronoid process of the ulna during flexion of the forearm.\n\nAbove the back
    part of the trochlea is a deep triangular depression, the olecranon fossa, in
    which the summit of the olecranon is received in extension of the forearm.\n\nThe
    coronoid fossa is the medial hollow part on the anterior surface of the distal
    humerus. \n\nThe coronoid fossa is smaller than the olecranon fossa and receives
    the coronoid process of the ulna during maximum flexion of the elbow.\n\nAbove
    the front part of the capitulum is a slight depression, the radial fossa, which
    receives the anterior border of the head of the radius, when the forearm is flexed.\n\nThese
    foss\xE6 are separated from one another by a thin, transparent lamina of bone,
    which is sometimes perforated by a supratrochlear foramen; they are lined in
    the fresh state by the synovial membrane of the elbow-joint, and their margins
    afford attachment to the anterior and posterior ligaments of this articulation.\n\nThe
    Capitulum is a rounded eminence forming the lateral part of the distal humerus.
    The head of the radius articulates with the capitulum.\n\nThe trochlea is spool-shaped
    medial portion of the distal humerus and articulates with the ulna.\n\n\n====
    Epicondyles ====\n\nThe epicondyles are continuous above with the supracondylar
    ridges.\n\nThe lateral epicondyle is a small, tuberculated eminence, curved a
    little forward, and giving attachment to the radial collateral ligament of the
    elbow-joint, and to a tendon common to the origin of the Supinator and some of
    the Extensor muscles.\n\nThe medial epicondyle, larger and more prominent than
    the lateral, is directed a little backward; it gives attachment to the ulnar
    collateral ligament of the elbow-joint, to the Pronator teres, and to a common
    tendon of origin of some of the Flexor muscles of the forearm; the ulnar nerve
    runs in a groove on the back of this epicondyle.\n\nThe Medial supracondylar
    crest forms the sharp medial border of the distal humerus continuing superiorly
    from the medial epicondyle. \n\nThe Lateral Supracondylar crest forms the sharp
    lateral border of the distal humerus continuing superiorly from the lateral epicondyle.\n\n\n====
    Borders ====\n\nThe medial portion of the articular surface is named the trochlea,
    and presents a deep depression between two well-marked borders; it is convex
    from before backward, concave from side to side, and occupies the anterior, lower,
    and posterior parts of the extremity.\n\nThe lateral border separates it from
    the groove which articulates with the margin of the head of the radius.\n\nThe
    medial border is thicker, of greater length, and consequently more prominent,
    than the lateral.\n\nThe grooved portion of the articular surface fits accurately
    within the semilunar notch of the ulna; it is broader and deeper on the posterior
    than on the anterior aspect of the bone, and is inclined obliquely downward and
    forward toward the medial side.\n\n\n=== Articulations ===\n\nAt the shoulder,
    the head of the humerus articulates with the glenoid fossa of the scapula. \n\nMore
    distally, at the elbow, the capitulum of the humerus articulates with the head
    of the radius, and the trochlea of the humerus articulates with the trochlear
    notch of the ulna.\n\n\n=== Nerves ===\n\nThe axillary nerve is located at the
    proximal end, against the shoulder girdle. \n\nDislocation of the humerus's glenohumeral
    joint has the potential to injure the axillary nerve or the axillary artery.
    Signs and symptoms of this dislocation include a loss of the normal shoulder
    contour and a palpable depression under the acromion.\n\nThe radial nerve follows
    the humerus closely. \n\nAt the midshaft of the humerus, the radial nerve travels
    from the posterior to the anterior aspect of the bone in the spiral groove. A
    fracture of the humerus in this region can result in radial nerve injury.\n\nThe
    ulnar nerve lies at the distal end of the humerus near the elbow. \n\nWhen struck,
    it can cause a distinct tingling sensation, and sometimes a significant amount
    of pain. \n\nIt is sometimes popularly referred to as 'the funny bone', possibly
    due to this sensation (a \"funny\" feeling), as well as the fact that the bone's
    name is a homophone of 'humorous'. \n\nIt lies posterior to the medial epicondyle,
    and is easily damaged in elbow injuries.\n\n\n=== Muscular attachment ===\n\nThe
    deltoid originates on the lateral third of the clavicle, acromion and the crest
    of the spine of the scapula. \n\nIt is inserted on the deltoid tuberosity of
    the humerus and has several actions including abduction, extension, and circumduction
    of the shoulder. \n\nThe supraspinatus also originates on the spine of the scapula.
    It inserts on the greater tubercle of the humerus, and assists in abduction of
    the shoulder.\n\nThe pectoralis major, teres major, and latissimus dorsi insert
    at the intertubercular groove of the humerus. \n\nThey work to adduct and medially,
    or internally, rotate the humerus.\n\nThe infraspinatus and teres minor insert
    on the greater tubercle, and work to laterally, or externally, rotate the humerus.
    \n\nIn contrast, the subscapularis muscle inserts onto the lesser tubercle and
    works to medially, or internally, rotate the humerus.\n\nThe biceps brachii,
    brachialis, and brachioradialis (which attaches distally) act to flex the elbow.
    \n\n(The biceps do not attach to the humerus.) The triceps brachii and anconeus
    extend the elbow, and attach to the posterior side of the humerus.\n\nThe four
    muscles of supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor and subscapularis form a
    musculo-ligamentous girdle called the rotator cuff. \n\nThis cuff stabilizes
    the very mobile but inherently unstable glenohumeral joint. \n\nThe other muscles
    are used as counterbalances for the actions of lifting/pulling and pressing/pushing.\n\n\n==
    Other animals ==\n\nPrimitive fossils of amphibians had little, if any, shaft
    connecting the upper and lower extremities, making their limbs very short. \n\nIn
    most living tetrapods, however, the humerus has a similar form to that of humans.
    \n\nIn many reptiles and some primitive mammals, the lower extremity includes
    a large foramen, or opening,  which allows nerves and blood vessels pass through.\n\t\n\t\t\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humerus\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n==
    Ossification ==\n\nDuring embryonic development, the humerus is one of the first
    structures to ossify, beginning with the first ossification center in the shaft
    of the bone. Ossification of the humerus occurs predictably in the embryo and
    fetus, and is therefore used as a fetal biometric measurement when determining
    gestational age of a fetus. At birth, the neonatal humerus is only ossified in
    the shaft. The epiphyses are cartilaginous at birth. The medial humeral head
    develops an ossification center around 4 months of age and the greater tuberosity
    around 10 months of age. These ossification centers begin to fuse at 3 years
    of age. The process of ossification is complete by 13 years of age, though the
    epiphyseal plate (growth plate) persists until skeletal maturity, usually around
    17 years of age.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHumerus fracture\n\n\n== References ==\n\n

  descriptionText: "\n\nSACRUM\n\n\nThe sacrum (plural: sacra or sacrums), in human
    anatomy, is a large, triangular bone at the base of the spine that forms by the
    fusing of the sacral vertebrae (S1\u2013S5) between ages 18 and 30.The sacrum
    situates at the upper, back part of the pelvic cavity, between the two wings
    of the pelvis. \n\nIt forms joints with four other bones. \n\nThe two projections
    at the sides of the sacrum are called the alae (wings), and articulate with the
    ilium at the L-shaped sacroiliac joints. \n\nThe upper part of the sacrum connects
    with the last lumbar vertebra (L5), and its lower part with the coccyx (tailbone)
    via the sacral and coccygeal cornua.\n\nThe sacrum has three different surfaces
    which are shaped to accommodate surrounding pelvic structures. \n\nOverall it
    is concave (curved upon itself). \n\nThe base of the sacrum, the broadest and
    uppermost part, is tilted forward as the sacral promontory internally. \n\nThe
    central part is curved outward toward the posterior, allowing greater room for
    the pelvic cavity.\n\nIn all other quadrupedal vertebrates, the pelvic vertebrae
    undergo a similar developmental process to form a sacrum in the adult, even while
    the bony tail (caudal) vertebrae remain unfused. \n\nThe number of sacral vertebrae
    varies slightly. \n\nFor instance, the S1\u2013S5 vertebrae of a horse will fuse,
    the S1\u2013S3 of a dog will fuse, and four pelvic vertebrae of a rat will fuse
    between the lumbar and the caudal vertebrae of its tail.\n\nThe Stegosaurus dinosaur
    had a greatly enlarged neural canal in the sacrum, characterized as a \"posterior
    brain case\u201D.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe sacrum is a complex structure providing
    support for the spine and accommodation for the spinal nerves. \n\nIt also articulates
    with the hip bones. \n\nThe sacrum has a base, an apex, and three surfaces \u2013
    a pelvic, dorsal and a lateral surface. \n\nThe base of the sacrum, which is
    broad and expanded, is directed upward and forward. \n\nOn either side of the
    base is a large projection known as an ala of sacrum and these alae (wings) articulate
    with the sacroiliac joints. \n\nThe alae support the psoas major muscles and
    the lumbosacral trunk which connects the lumbar plexus with the sacral plexus.
    \n\nIn the articulated pelvis the alae are continuous with the iliac fossa. \n\nEach
    ala is slightly concave from side to side, and convex from the back and gives
    attachment to a few of the fibers of the iliacus muscle. \n\nThe posterior quarter
    of the ala represents the transverse process, and its anterior three-quarters
    the costal process of the first sacral segment. \n\nEach ala also serves as part
    of the border of the pelvic brim. \n\nThe alae also form the base of the lumbosacral
    triangle. \n\nThe iliolumbar ligament and lumbosacral ligaments are attached
    to the ala.\n\nIn the middle of the base is a large oval articular surface, the
    upper surface of the body of the first sacral vertebra, which is connected with
    the under surface of the body of the last lumbar vertebra by an intervertebral
    fibrocartilage. \n\nBehind this is the large triangular orifice of the sacral
    canal, which is completed by the lamina and spinous process of the first sacral
    vertebra. \n\nThe superior articular processes project from it on either side;
    they are oval, concave, directed backward and medialward, like the superior articular
    processes of a lumbar vertebra. \n\nThey are attached to the body of the first
    sacral vertebra and to each ala, by short thick pedicles; on the upper surface
    of each pedicle is a vertebral notch, which forms the lower part of the foramen
    between the last lumbar and first sacral vertebrae.\n\nThe apex is directed downward
    and presents an oval facet for articulation with the coccyx. \n\nThe sacral canal
    as a continuation of the vertebral canal runs throughout the greater part of
    the sacrum. \n\nThe sacral angle is the angle formed by the true conjugate with
    the two pieces of sacrum. \n\nNormally it is greater than 60 degrees. \n\nA sacral
    angle of lesser degree suggests funneling of the pelvis.\n\n\n=== Promontory
    ===\n\nThe sacral promontory marks part of the border of the pelvic inlet, and
    comprises the iliopectineal line and the linea terminalis. \n\nThe sacral promontory
    articulates with the last lumbar vertebra to form the sacrovertebral angle, an
    angle of 30 degrees from the horizontal plane that provides a useful marker for
    a sling implant procedure.\n\n\n=== Surfaces ===\n\n\nThe pelvic surface of the
    sacrum is concave from the top, and curved slightly from side to side. \n\nIts
    middle part is crossed by four transverse ridges, which correspond to the original
    planes of separation between the five sacral vertebrae. \n\nThe body of the first
    segment is large and has the form of a lumbar vertebra; the bodies of the next
    bones get progressively smaller, are flattened from the back, and curved to shape
    themselves to the sacrum, being concave in front and convex behind. \n\nAt each
    end of the transverse ridges, are the four anterior sacral foramina, diminishing
    in size in line with the smaller vertebral bodies. \n\nThe foramina give exit
    to the anterior divisions of the sacral nerves and entrance to the lateral sacral
    arteries. \n\nEach part at the sides of the foramina is traversed by four broad,
    shallow grooves, which lodge the anterior divisions of the sacral nerves. \n\nThey
    are separated by prominent ridges of bone which give origin to the piriformis
    muscle. \n\nIf a sagittal section be made through the center of the sacrum, the
    bodies are seen to be united at their circumferences by bone, wide intervals
    being left centrally, which, in the fresh state, are filled by the intervertebral
    discs.\n\nThe dorsal surface of the sacrum is convex and narrower than the pelvic
    surface. \n\nIn the middle line is the median sacral crest, surmounted by three
    or four tubercles\u2014the rudimentary spinous processes of the upper three or
    four sacral vertebrae. \n\nOn either side of the median sacral crest is a shallow
    sacral groove, which gives origin to the multifidus muscle. \n\nThe floor of
    the groove is formed by the united laminae of the corresponding vertebrae. \n\nThe
    laminae of the fifth sacral vertebra, and sometimes those of the fourth, do not
    meet at the back, resulting in a fissure known as the sacral hiatus in the posterior
    wall of the sacral canal. \n\nThe sacral canal is a continuation of the spinal
    canal and runs throughout the greater part of the sacrum. \n\nAbove the sacral
    hiatus, it is triangular in form. \n\nThe canal lodges the sacral nerves, via
    the anterior and posterior sacral foramina.\nOn the lateral aspect of the sacral
    groove is a linear series of tubercles produced by the fusion of the articular
    processes which together form the indistinct medial sacral crest. \n\nThe articular
    processes of the first sacral vertebra are large and oval-shaped. \n\nTheir facets
    are concave from side to side, face to the back and middle, and articulate with
    the facets on the inferior processes of the fifth lumbar vertebra.\n\nThe tubercles
    of the inferior articular processes of the fifth sacral vertebra, known as the
    sacral cornua, are projected downward and are connected to the cornua of the
    coccyx. \n\nAt the side of the articular processes are the four posterior sacral
    foramina; they are smaller in size and less regular in form than those at the
    front, and transmit the posterior divisions of the sacral nerves. \n\nOn the
    side of the posterior sacral foramina is a series of tubercles, the transverse
    processes of the sacral vertebrae, and these form the lateral sacral crest. \n\nThe
    transverse tubercles of the first sacral vertebra are large and very distinct;
    they, together with the transverse tubercles of the second vertebra, give attachment
    to the horizontal parts of the posterior sacroiliac ligaments; those of the third
    vertebra give attachment to the oblique fasciculi of the posterior sacroiliac
    ligaments; and those of the fourth and fifth to the sacrotuberous ligaments.\n\nThe
    lateral surface of the sacrum is broad above, but narrows into a thin edge below.
    \n\nThe upper half presents in front an ear-shaped surface, the auricular surface,
    covered with cartilage in the immature state, for articulation with the ilium.
    \n\nBehind it is a rough surface, the sacral tuberosity, on which are three deep
    and uneven impressions, for the attachment of the posterior sacroiliac ligament.
    \n\nThe lower half is thin, and ends in a projection called the inferior lateral
    angle. \n\nMedial to this angle is a notch, which is converted into a foramen
    by the transverse process of the first piece of the coccyx, and this transmits
    the anterior division of the fifth sacral nerve. \n\nThe thin lower half of the
    lateral surface gives attachment to the sacrotuberous and sacrospinous ligaments,
    to some fibers of the gluteus maximus at the back and to the coccygeus in the
    front.\n\n\n=== Articulations ===\n\nThe sacrum articulates with four bones:\n\n-the
    last lumbar vertebra above\n-the coccyx (tailbone) below\n-the illium portion
    of the hip bone on either side\n\nRotation of the sacrum superiorly and anteriorly
    whilst the coccyx moves posteriorly relative to the ilium is sometimes called
    \"nutation\" (from the Latin term nutatio which means \"nodding\") and the reverse,
    postero-inferior motion of the sacrum relative to the ilium whilst the coccyx
    moves anteriorly, \"counter-nutation\".\n\nIn upright vertebrates, the sacrum
    is capable of slight independent movement along the sagittal plane. \n\nOn bending
    backward the top (base) of the sacrum moves forward relative to the ilium; on
    bending forward the top moves back.\n\nThe sacrum refers to all of the parts
    combined. \n\nIts parts are called sacral vertebrae when referred individually.\n\n\n===
    Variations ===\n\nIn some cases the sacrum will consist of six pieces or be reduced
    in number to four. \n\nThe bodies of the first and second vertebrae may fail
    to unite.\n\n\n=== Development ===\n\nThe somites that give rise to the vertebral
    column begin to develop from head to tail along the length of the notochord.
    \n\nAt day 20 of embryogenesis the first four pairs of somites appear in the
    future occipital bone region. \n\nDeveloping at the rate of three or four a day,
    the next eight pairs form in the cervical region to develop into the cervical
    vertebrae; the next twelve pairs will form the thoracic vertebrae; the next five
    pairs the lumbar vertebrae and by about day 29 the sacral somites will appear
    to develop into the sacral vertebrae; finally on day 30 the last three pairs
    will form the coccyx.\n\n\n== Clinical significance ==\n\n=== Congenital disorders
    ===\n\nThe congenital disorder, spina bifida, occurs as a result of a defective
    embryonic neural tube, characterised by the incomplete closure of vertebral arch
    or of the incomplete closure of the surface of the vertebral canal. \n\nThe most
    common sites for spina bifida malformations are the lumbar and sacral areas.\n\nAnother
    congenital disorder is that of caudal regression syndrome also known as sacral
    agenesis. \n\nThis is characterised by an abnormal underdevelopment in the embryo
    (occurring by the seventh week) of the lower spine. \n\nSometimes part of the
    coccyx is absent, or the lower vertebrae can be absent, or on occasion a small
    part of the spine is missing with no outward sign.\n\n\n=== Fracture ===\n\nSacral
    fractures are relatively uncommon; however, they are often associated with neurological
    deficits. \n\nIn the presence of neurological signs, most of the times they are
    treated with surgical fixation.\n\n\n=== Cancer ===\n\nThe sacrum is one of the
    main sites for the development of the sarcomas known as chordomas that are derived
    from the remnants of the embryonic notochord.\n\n\n== Other animals ==\n\nIn
    dogs the sacrum is formed by three fused vertebrae. \n\nThe sacrum in the horse
    is made up of five fused vertebrae. \n\nIn birds the sacral vertebrae are fused
    with the lumbar and some caudal and thoracic vertebrae to form a single structure
    called the synsacrum. \n\nIn the frog the ilium is elongated and forms a mobile
    joint with the sacrum that acts as an additional limb to give more power to its
    leaps.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nEnglish sacrum was introduced as a technical term
    in anatomy in the mid-18th century, as a shortening of the Late Latin name os
    sacrum \"sacred bone\", itself a translation of Greek \u1F31\u03B5\u03C1\u03CC\u03BD
    \u1F40\u03C3\u03C4\u03AD\u03BF\u03BD, the term found in the writings of Galen.
    \n\nPrior to the adoption of sacrum, the bone was also called holy bone in English,
    paralleling German heiliges Bein or Heiligenbein (alongside Kreuzbein) and Dutch
    heiligbeen.\n\nThe origin of Galen's term is unclear. \n\nSupposedly the sacrum
    was the part of an animal offered in sacrifice (since the sacrum is the seat
    of the organs of procreation). \n\nOthers attribute the adjective \u1F31\u03B5\u03C1\u03CC\u03BD
    to the ancient belief that this specific bone would be indestructible. \n\nAs
    the Greek adjective \u1F31\u03B5\u03C1\u03CC\u03C2 may also mean \"strong\",
    it has also been suggested that os sacrum is a mistranslation of a term intended
    to mean \"the strong bone\". \n\nThis is supported by the alternative Greek name
    \u03BC\u03AD\u03B3\u03B1\u03C2 \u03C3\u03C0\u03CC\u03BD\u03B4\u03C5\u03BB\u03BF\u03C2
    by the Greeks, translating to \"large vertebra\", translated into Latin as vertebra
    magna.\n\nIn Classical Greek the bone was known as \u03BA\u03BB\u03CC\u03BD\u03B9\u03C2
    (Latinized clonis); this term is cognate to Latin clunis \"buttock\", Sanskrit
    \u015Br\xF3\u1E47is \"haunch\" and Lithuanian \u0161launis \"hip, thigh\". \n\nThe
    Latin word is found in the alternative Latin name of the sacrum, ossa clunium,
    as it were \"bones of the buttocks\". \n\nDue to the fact that the os sacrum
    is broad and thick at its upper end, the sacrum is alternatively called os latum,
    \"broad bone\".\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrum"

  descriptionText: "\n\nSINUS OF SPHENOID BONE\n\nThe sphenoid sinus is one of the
    four paired paranasal sinuses that is contained within the body of the sphenoid
    bone. The sphenoid sinuses vary in size and shape, and owing to the lateral displacement
    of the intervening septum, which may insert on the carotid canal, they are rarely
    symmetrical. They cannot be palpated during an extraoral examination.\n\nThe
    following are their average measurements: vertical height, 2.2 cm; transverse
    breadth, 2 cm; antero-posterior depth, 2.2 cm. \n\n    STRUCTURE\n    \nWhen
    exceptionally large the sphenoid sinuses may extend into the roots of the pterygoid
    processes or great wings, and may invade the basilar part of the occipital bone.\n\nEach
    sinus opens into the roof of the nasal cavity via apertures on the posterior
    wall of the sphenoethmoidal recess directly above the choana. The apertures are
    located high on the anterior walls of the sinuses themselves.\n\n    DEVELOPMENT\n\nThey
    are not present at birth, they slowly develop with the growth of the skull. Just
    after puberty the sinuses finish development.\n\n    NERVE SUPPLY\n    \nThe
    mucous membrane receives sensory innervation by the posterior ethmoidal nerves
    (branch of the ophthalmic nerve), and postganglionic parasympathetic fibers of
    the facial nerve that synapsed at the pterygopalatine ganglion which controls
    secretion of mucus. \n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphenoid_sinus"

  descriptionText: "\n\nTRAPEZOID BONE\n\n\nThe trapezoid bone (lesser multangular
    bone) is a carpal bone in tetrapods, including humans. \n\nIt is the smallest
    bone in the distal row of carpal bones that give structure to the palm of the
    hand. \n\nIt may be known by its wedge-shaped form, the broad end of the wedge
    constituting the dorsal, the narrow end the palmar surface; and by its having
    four articular facets touching each other, and separated by sharp edges. \n\nIt
    is homologous with the \"second distal carpal\" of reptiles and amphibians.\n\n\n==
    Structure ==\n\nThe trapezoid is a four-sided carpal bone found within the hand.
    \n\nThe trapezoid is found within the distal row of carpal bones.\n\n\n=== Surfaces
    ===\n\nThe superior surface, quadrilateral, smooth, and slightly concave, articulates
    with the scaphoid.\n\nThe inferior surface articulates with the proximal end
    of the second metacarpal bone; it is convex from side to side, concave from before
    backward and subdivided by an elevated ridge into two unequal facets.\n\nThe
    dorsal and palmar surfaces are rough for the attachment of ligaments, the former
    being the larger of the two.\n\nThe lateral surface, convex and smooth, articulates
    with the trapezium.\n\nThe medial surface is concave and smooth in front, for
    articulation with the capitate; rough behind, for the attachment of an interosseous
    ligament.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\nThe carpal bones function as a unit to provide
    a bony superstructure for the hand.\n\n\n== Clinical Significance ==\n\nIsolated
    fractures of the trapezoid are rare, representing 0.4% of the total, thus being
    the least common of all carpal fractures. \n\nThis is due to the bone being in
    a fairly protected position. \n\nDistally, it forms a stable, relatively immobile
    joint with the second metacarpal, radially and proximally it forms strong ligaments
    with the trapezium and the capitate ulnarly, scaphoid respectively.\n\nHowever,
    injury can occur through axial force applied to the second metacarpal base. \n\nSubluxations,
    such as ones caused by delivering a blow, are not uncommon. \n\nDirect trauma
    to the bone can also cause fracture.\nDue to its rarity, standard treatment has
    not been established. \n\nA wide range of treatments are possible, including
    rest, surgery and casting.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe etymology derives from the
    Greek trapezion which means \"irregular quadrilateral,\" from tra- \"four\" and
    peza \"foot\" or \"edge.\" Literally, \"a little table\" from trapeza meaning
    \"table\" and -oeides \"shaped.\"\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapezoid_bone"

  descriptionText: "\n\nNAVICULAR BONE\n\n\nThe navicular bone is a small bone found
    in the feet of most mammals.\n\n\n== Human anatomy ==\n\nThe navicular bone in
    humans is one of the tarsal bones, found in the foot. \n\nIts name derives from
    the human bone's resemblance to a small boat, caused by the strongly concave
    proximal articular surface. \n\nThe term navicular bone or hand navicular bone
    was formerly used for the scaphoid bone, one of the carpal bones of the wrist.\n\nThe
    navicular bone in humans is located on the medial side of the foot, and articulates
    proximally with the talus, distally with the three cuneiform bones, and laterally
    with the cuboid.\n\nIt is the last of the foot bones to start ossification and
    does not tend to do so until the end of the third year in girls and the beginning
    of the fourth year in boys, although a large range of variation has been reported.\n\nThe
    tibialis posterior is the only muscle that attaches to the navicular bone. \n\nThe
    main portion of the muscle inserts into the tuberosity of the navicular bone.
    \n\nAn accessory navicular bone may be present in 2\u201314% of the general population.\n\n\n===
    Clinical significance ===\n\nThe human navicular is not a commonly broken bone
    but it breaks due two reasons. \n\nThe first mechanism is a stress fracture which
    happens commonly in athletes and the other mechanism is a high energy trauma.
    \n\nThe navicular bone is a keystone of the foot: it is part of the coxa pedis
    and articulates with the talus, first, second and third cuneiform, cuboid and
    calcaneus. \n\nIt plays an important role in the biomechanics of the foot helping
    in inversion, eversion and motion; it is a structural link between midfoot and
    forefoot and it is part of the longitudinal and transverse arch of the foot.\n\n\n==
    Horse anatomy ==\n\nThe horse has a sesamoid bone called the navicular bone,
    located within the hoof, that lies on the palmar aspect of the coffin joint between
    the second phalanx and third phalanx (coffin bone). \n\nThe navicular bone in
    the horse is supported by the distal sesamoidean impar ligament and two collateral
    sesamoidean ligaments. \n\nThe navicular bursa is located between the flexor
    surface of the navicular bone and the deep digital flexor tendon, which runs
    between the bursa and the distal phalanx. \n\nThe central tarsal bone in the
    hock of the horse is homologous and analogous to the navicular bone of the human
    foot, and thus the navicular bone in the horse is a different structure from
    the eponymously labeled bone in humans.\n\nThe navicular region is an important
    structure in relation to lameness, particularly in the front feet, and is involved
    with a significant disease process called navicular disease or navicular syndrome.
    \n\nRecently much of the original literature concerning navicular disease has
    been called into question, particularly the significance of radiographic changes
    as a sole diagnostic criterion. \n\nNavicular syndrome may be responsible for
    as much as 1/3 of all cases of lameness in horses, but radiographic changes in
    the navicular bone do not always provide a definitive diagnosis. \n\nNewer imaging
    techniques have shown that damage to the soft tissues in the region may be significant
    contributors to lameness and that multiple causes may result in visible lameness.\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navicular_bone"

    first premolar, maxillary second premolar, mandibular first premolar, and the
    mandibular second premolar. \n\nPremolar teeth by definition are permanent teeth
    distal to the canines, preceded by deciduous molars.\n\n\n=== Morphology ===\n\nThere
    is always one large buccal cusp, especially so in the mandibular first premolar.
    \n\nThe lower second premolar almost always presents with two lingual cusps.The
    lower premolars and the upper second premolar usually have one root. \n\nThe
    upper first usually has two roots, but can have just one root, notably in Sinodonts,
    and can sometimes have three roots.Premolars are unique to the permanent dentition.
    \n\nPremolars are referred to as bicuspid (has two main cusps), a buccal and
    a palatal/lingual cusp which are separated by a mesiodistal occlusal fissure.\nThe
    maxillary premolars are trapezoidal in shape. \n\nWhilst the mandibular premolars
    are rhomboidal in shape.\n\n\n==== Maxillary first premolar ====\nThe crown of
    the tooth appears ovoid, wider buccally than palatally\nFrom a buccal view, the
    first premolar is similar to the adjacent canine\nRoots: Two roots buccal and
    palatal. \n\nSometimes (40%) there is only one root.\n\n\n==== Maxillary second
    premolar ====\nSimilar to maxillary first premolar but the mesio-buccal and disto-buccal
    corners are rounder\nThe two cusps are smaller and more equal in size\nShorter
    occlusal fissure\nUsually one root\n\n\n==== Mandibular first premolar ====\n\n-The
    smallest premolar out of all four\n-Dominant buccal cusp and a very small lingual
    cusp\n-The buccal cusp is broad and the lingual cusp is less than half the size
    of the buccal cusp.\n-Two-thirds of the buccal surface can be seen from the occlusal
    aspect\n-A single conical root with an oval/round cross section. \n-The root
    is grooved longitudinally both mesially and distally.\n\n\n==== Mandibular second
    premolar ====\n\nThe crown is larger than the mandibular first premolar\nLingual
    cusp is smaller than the buccal cusp but better developed.\n\nThe lingual and
    buccal cusp is separated by a well defined mesiodistal occlusal fissure\n\nThe
    lingual cusp is divided into two; the mesiolingual and distolingual cusps with
    the mesiolingual cusp being higher and wider than the distolingual.\n\nRoot:
    Single conical root, oval/round in cross section.\n\n\n== Orthodontics ==\n\nThe
    four first premolars are the most commonly removed teeth, in 48.8% of cases,
    when teeth are removed for orthodontic treatment (which is in 45.8% of orthodontic
    patients). \n\nThe removal of only the maxillary first premolars is the second
    likeliest option, in 14.5% of cases.\n\n\n== Other mammals ==\n\nIn primitive
    placental mammals there are four premolars per quadrant, but the most mesial
    two (closer to the front of the mouth) have been lost in catarrhines (Old World
    monkeys and apes, including humans). \n\nPaleontologists therefore refer to human
    premolars as Pm3 and Pm4.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premolar"

  descriptionText: "\n\nMAJOR ALAR CARTILAGE\n\n\nThe major alar cartilages are positioned
    with one structure on each side of the nasal tip. \n\nSuperiorly, the major alar
    cartilages are connected to the lateral nasal cartilage via fibrous tissues.
    \n\nComposed of hyaline cartilage, these structures are very thin and folded
    to form the lateral and medial crus. \n\nThe medial crus is the inner portion
    of the major alar cartilages that are situated perpendicularly to the septal
    nasal cartilage. \n\nThe lateral crus is the outer portion of the major alar
    cartilages that associate with the ala of the nose.\n\nBoth crus come together
    to form an oval tip at each nostril. \n\nBoth sides of the major alar cartilages
    merge together to form a notch at the tip, which is referred to as the apex of
    the nose. \n\nWith the formation of the medial and lateral walls within the nares,
    the major alar cartilages function to hold open each naris. \n\nThis allows maximal
    airflow to reach the nasal valve, allowing optimal respiration. \n\nDue to weakness
    corresponding with the lateral crus in certain individuals, a technique called
    sliding alar cartilage (SAC) has been a procedure practiced to restructure and
    support the nasal tip.\n"

  descriptionText: "\n\nMETACARPAL BONES\n\n\nIn human anatomy, the metacarpal bones
    or metacarpus, form the intermediate part of the skeletal hand located between
    the phalanges of the fingers and the carpal bones of the wrist which forms the
    connection to the forearm. \n\nThe metacarpal bones are analogous to the metatarsal
    bones in the foot.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\n\nThe metacarpals form a transverse
    arch to which the rigid row of distal carpal bones are fixed. \n\nThe peripheral
    metacarpals (those of the thumb and little finger) form the sides of the cup
    of the palmar gutter and as they are brought together they deepen this concavity.
    \n\nThe index metacarpal is the most firmly fixed, while the thumb metacarpal
    articulates with the trapezium and acts independently from the others. \n\nThe
    middle metacarpals are tightly united to the carpus by intrinsic interlocking
    bone elements at their bases. \n\nThe ring metacarpal is somewhat more mobile
    while the fifth metacarpal is semi-independent.Each metacarpal bone consists
    of a body or shaft, and two extremities: the head at the distal or digital end
    (near the fingers), and the base at the proximal or carpal end (close to the
    wrist).\n\n\n=== Body ===\n\nThe body (shaft) is prismoid in form, and curved,
    so as to be convex in the longitudinal direction behind, concave in front. \n\nIt
    presents three surfaces: medial, lateral, and dorsal.\n\nThe medial and lateral
    surfaces are concave, for the attachment of the interosseus muscles, and separated
    from one another by a prominent anterior ridge.\n\nThe dorsal surface presents
    in its distal two-thirds a smooth, triangular, flattened area which is covered
    in by the tendons of the extensor muscles. \n\nThis surface is bounded by two
    lines, which commence in small tubercles situated on either side of the digital
    extremity, and, passing upward, converge and meet some distance above the center
    of the bone and form a ridge which runs along the rest of the dorsal surface
    to the carpal extremity. \n\nThis ridge separates two sloping surfaces for the
    attachment of the interossei dorsales.\n\nTo the tubercles on the digital extremities
    are attached the collateral ligaments of the metacarpophalangeal joints.\n\n\n===
    Base ===\n\nThe base (basis) or carpal extremity is of a cuboidal form, and broader
    behind than in front: it articulates with the carpal bones and with the adjoining
    metacarpal bones; its dorsal and volar surfaces are rough, for the attachment
    of ligaments.\n\n\n=== Head ===\n\nThe head (caput) or digital extremity presents
    an oblong surface markedly convex from before backward, less so transversely,
    and flattened from side to side; it articulates with the proximal phalanx. \n\nIt
    is broader, and extends farther upward, on the volar than on the dorsal aspect,
    and is longer in the antero-posterior than in the transverse diameter. \n\nOn
    either side of the head is a tubercle for the attachment of the collateral ligament
    of the metacarpophalangeal joint.\n\nThe dorsal surface, broad and flat, supports
    the tendons of the extensor muscles.\n\nThe volar surface is grooved in the middle
    line for the passage of the flexor tendons, and marked on either side by an articular
    eminence continuous with the terminal articular surface.\n\n\n=== Neck ===\n\nThe
    neck, or subcapital segment, is the transition zone between the body and the
    head.\n\n\n=== Articulations ===\n\nBesides the metacarpophalangeal joints, the
    metacarpal bones articulate by carpometacarpal joints as follows:\n\n-the first
    with the trapezium;\n-the second with the trapezium, trapezoid, capitate and
    third metacarpal;\n-the third with the capitate and second and fourth metacarpals;\n-the
    fourth with the capitate, hamate, and third and fifth metacarpals;\n-and the
    fifth with the hamate and fourth metacarpal;\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Insertions ===\n\n-Extensor
    Carpi Radialis Longus/Brevis: Both insert on the base of metacarpal II; Assist
    with wrist extension and radial flexion of the wrist\n-Extensor Carpi Ulnaris:
    Inserts on the base of metacarpal V; Extends and fixes wrist when digits are
    being flexed; assists with ulnar flexion of wrist\n-Abductor Pollicis Longus:
    Inserts on the trapezium and base of metacarpal I; Abducts thumb in frontal plane;
    extends thumb at carpometacarpal joint\n-Opponens Pollicis: Inserts on metacarpal
    I; flexes metacarpal I to oppose the thumb to the fingertips\n-Opponens digiti
    minimi: Inserts on the medial surface of metacarpal V; Flexes metacarpal V at
    carpometacarpal joint when little finger is moved into opposition with tip of
    thumb; deepens palm of hand.\n\n\t\t\n\n\n== Clinical significance ==\n\n===
    Congenital disorders ===\n\nThe fourth and fifth metacarpal bones are commonly
    \"blunted\" or shortened, in pseudohypoparathyroidism and pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism.\n\nA
    blunted fourth metacarpal, with normal fifth metacarpal, can signify Turner syndrome.\n\nBlunted
    metacarpals (particularly the fourth metacarpal) are a symptom of Nevoid basal
    cell carcinoma syndrome.\n\n\n=== Fracture ===\n\nThe neck of a metacarpal is
    a common location for a boxer's fracture. \n\nHowever, all parts of the metacarpal
    bone (including head, body and base) are susceptible to fracture. \n\nFor these
    fractures several types of treatment exist ranging from non-operative techniques
    with or without immobilization to operative techniques using closed or open reduction
    and internal fixation (ORIF). \n\nGenerally speaking most fractures showing little
    or no displacement can be treated successfully without surgery. \n\nIntraarticular
    fracture-dislocations of the metacarpal head or base may require surgical fixation,
    as fragment displacement affecting the joint surface is rarely tolerated well.\n\n\n==
    Other animals ==\n\nIn four-legged animals, the metacarpals form part of the
    forefeet, and are frequently reduced in number, appropriate to the number of
    toes. \n\nIn digitigrade and unguligrade animals, the metacarpals are greatly
    extended and strengthened, forming an additional segment to the limb, a feature
    that typically enhances the animal's speed. \n\nIn both birds and bats, the metacarpals
    form part of the wing.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Etymology ===\n\nThe Greek physician
    Galen used to refer to the metacarpus as \u03BC\u03B5\u03C4\u03B1\u03BA\u03AC\u03C1\u03C0\u03B9\u03BF\u03BD.
    \n\nThe Latin form metacarpium more truly resembles its Ancient Greek predecessor

    \n\nMeta\u2013 is Greek for beyond and carpal from Ancient Greek \u03BA\u03B1\u03C1\u03C0\u03CC\u03C2
    (karp\xF3s, \u201Cwrist\u201D).\n\nIn anatomic Latin, adjectives like metacarpius,
    metacarpicus, metacarpiaeus, metacarpeus, metacarpianus and metacarpalis can
    be found. \n\nThe form metacarpius is more true to the later Greek form \u03BC\u03B5\u03C4\u03B1\u03BA\u03AC\u03C1\u03C0\u03B9\u03BF\u03C2.
    \n\nMetacarpalis, as in ossa metacarpalia in the current official Latin nomenclature,
    Terminologia Anatomica is a compound consisting of Latin and Greek parts. \n\nThe
    usage of such hybrids in anatomic Latin is disapproved by some.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacarpal_bones"

    not to the sternum or cartilage of the sternum.\n\nThese ribs are relatively
    small and delicate, and include a cartilaginous tip."

  descriptionText: "\n\nTRAPEZOID BONE\n\n\nThe trapezoid bone (lesser multangular
    bone) is a carpal bone in tetrapods, including humans. \n\nIt is the smallest
    bone in the distal row of carpal bones that give structure to the palm of the
    hand. \n\nIt may be known by its wedge-shaped form, the broad end of the wedge
    constituting the dorsal, the narrow end the palmar surface; and by its having
    four articular facets touching each other, and separated by sharp edges. \n\nIt
    is homologous with the \"second distal carpal\" of reptiles and amphibians.\n\n\n==
    Structure ==\n\nThe trapezoid is a four-sided carpal bone found within the hand.
    \n\nThe trapezoid is found within the distal row of carpal bones.\n\n\n=== Surfaces
    ===\n\nThe superior surface, quadrilateral, smooth, and slightly concave, articulates
    with the scaphoid.\n\nThe inferior surface articulates with the proximal end
    of the second metacarpal bone; it is convex from side to side, concave from before
    backward and subdivided by an elevated ridge into two unequal facets.\n\nThe
    dorsal and palmar surfaces are rough for the attachment of ligaments, the former
    being the larger of the two.\n\nThe lateral surface, convex and smooth, articulates
    with the trapezium.\n\nThe medial surface is concave and smooth in front, for
    articulation with the capitate; rough behind, for the attachment of an interosseous
    ligament.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\nThe carpal bones function as a unit to provide
    a bony superstructure for the hand.\n\n\n== Clinical Significance ==\n\nIsolated
    fractures of the trapezoid are rare, representing 0.4% of the total, thus being
    the least common of all carpal fractures. \n\nThis is due to the bone being in
    a fairly protected position. \n\nDistally, it forms a stable, relatively immobile
    joint with the second metacarpal, radially and proximally it forms strong ligaments
    with the trapezium and the capitate ulnarly, scaphoid respectively.\n\nHowever,
    injury can occur through axial force applied to the second metacarpal base. \n\nSubluxations,
    such as ones caused by delivering a blow, are not uncommon. \n\nDirect trauma
    to the bone can also cause fracture.\nDue to its rarity, standard treatment has
    not been established. \n\nA wide range of treatments are possible, including
    rest, surgery and casting.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe etymology derives from the
    Greek trapezion which means \"irregular quadrilateral,\" from tra- \"four\" and
    peza \"foot\" or \"edge.\" Literally, \"a little table\" from trapeza meaning
    \"table\" and -oeides \"shaped.\"\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapezoid_bone"

  descriptionText: "\n\nZYGOMATIC BONE\n\n\nIn the human skull, the zygomatic bone
    (cheekbone or malar bone) is a paired irregular bone which articulates with the
    maxilla, the temporal bone, the sphenoid bone and the frontal bone. \n\nIt is
    situated at the upper and lateral part of the face and forms the prominence of
    the cheek, part of the lateral wall and floor of the orbit, and parts of the
    temporal fossa and the infratemporal fossa. \n\nIt presents a malar and a temporal
    surface; four processes (the frontosphenoidal, orbital, maxillary, and temporal),
    and four borders.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe term zygomatic derives from the
    Greek \u0396\u03C5\u03B3\u03CC\u03BC\u03B1 zygoma meaning \"yoke\". \n\nThe zygomatic
    bone is occasionally referred to as the zygoma, but this term may also refer
    to the zygomatic arch.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\n\n\n=== Surfaces ===\n\nThe malar
    surface is convex and perforated near its center by a small aperture, the zygomaticofacial
    foramen, for the passage of the zygomaticofacial nerve and vessels; below this
    foramen is a slight elevation, which gives origin to the zygomaticus muscle.\nThe
    temporal surface, directed posteriorly and medially, is concave, presenting medially
    a rough, triangular area, for articulation with the maxilla (articular surface),
    and laterally a smooth, concave surface, the upper part of which forms the anterior
    boundary of the temporal fossa, the lower a part of the infratemporal fossa.
    \n\nNear the center of this surface is the zygomaticotemporal foramen for the
    transmission of the zygomaticotemporal nerve.\nThe orbital surface forms the
    lateral part and some of the inferior part of the bony orbit. \n\nThe zygomatic
    nerve passes through the zygomatic-orbital foramen on this surface. \n\nThe lateral
    palpebral ligament attaches to a small protuberance called the orbital tubercle.\n\n\n===
    Processes ===\n\nEach zygomatic bone is diamond-shaped and composed of three
    processes with similarly named associated bony articulations: frontal, temporal,
    and maxillary. \n\nEach process of the zygomatic bone forms important structures
    of the skull.\nThe orbital surface of the frontal process of the zygomatic bone
    forms the anterior lateral orbital wall, with usually a small paired foramen,
    the zygomaticofacial foramen opening on its lateral surface. \n\nThe temporal
    process of the zygomatic bone forms the zygomatic arch along with the zygomatic
    process of the temporal bone, with a paired zygomaticotemporal foramen present
    on the medial deep surface of the bone. \n\nThe orbital surface of the maxillary
    process of the zygomatic bone forms a part of the infraorbital rim and a small
    part of the anterior part of the lateral orbital wall.\n\n\n=== Orbital process
    ===\n\nThe orbital process is a thick, strong plate, projecting backward and
    medialward from the orbital margin. \n\nIts antero-medial surface forms, by its
    junction with the orbital surface of the maxilla and with the great wing of the
    sphenoid, part of the floor and lateral wall of the orbit. \n\nOn it are seen
    the orifices of two canals, the zygomatico-orbital foramina; one of these canals
    opens into the temporal fossa, the other on the malar surface of the bone; the
    former transmits the zygomaticotemporal, the latter the zygomaticofacial nerve.\n\nIts
    postero-lateral surface, smooth and convex, forms parts of the temporal and infratemporal
    fossae.\nIts anterior margin, smooth and rounded, is part of the circumference
    of the orbit.\nIts superior margin, rough, and directed horizontally, articulates
    with the frontal bone behind the zygomatic process.\nIts posterior margin is
    serrated for articulation, with the great wing of the sphenoid and the orbital
    surface of the maxilla.At the angle of junction of the sphenoidal and maxillary
    portions, a short, concave, non-articular part is generally seen; this forms
    the anterior boundary of the inferior orbital fissure: occasionally, this non-articular
    part is absent, the fissure then being completed by the junction of the maxilla
    and sphenoid, or by the interposition of a small sutural bone in the angular
    interval between them.\n\n\n=== Borders ===\n\nThe antero-superior or orbital
    border is smooth, concave, and forms a considerable part of the circumference
    of the orbit.\nThe antero-inferior or maxillary border is rough, and bevelled
    at the expense of its inner table, to articulate with the maxilla; near the orbital
    margin it gives origin to the quadratus labii superioris.\nThe postero-superior
    or temporal border, curved like an italic letter f, is continuous above with
    the commencement of the temporal line, and below with the upper border of the
    zygomatic arch; the temporal fascia is attached to it.\nThe postero-inferior
    or zygomatic border affords attachment by its rough edge to the masseter.\n\n\n===
    Articulations ===\n\nThe zygomatic bone articulates with the frontal bone, sphenoid
    bone, and paired temporal bones, and maxillary bones.\n\n\n=== Development ===\n\nThe
    zygomatic bone is generally described as ossifying from three centers\u2014one
    for the malar and two for the orbital portion; these appear about the eighth
    week and fuse about the fifth month of fetal life.\nMall describes it as being
    ossified from one center which appears just beneath and to the lateral side of
    the orbit.\nAfter birth, the bone is sometimes divided by a horizontal suture
    into an upper larger, and a lower smaller division.\nIn some quadrumana the zygomatic
    bone consisted of two parts, an orbital and a malar.\n\n\n== Society and culture
    ==\n\n\nPronounced zygomatic arches, commonly called \"high cheekbones\", are
    considered a beauty trait in some cultures, in both males and females.Ancient
    Chinese sculptures of goddesses typically have a \"broad forehead, raised eyebrows,
    high cheekbones, and large, sensuous mouth\". \n\nSimilarly, many depictions
    of Qin warriors in the Terracotta Army are depicted with \"broad foreheads, high
    cheekbones, large eyes, thick eyebrows, and stiff beards.\"For this reason some
    individuals undergo cheek augmentation, a form of cosmetic surgery.\n\n\n== Other
    animals ==\n\nThe zygomatic is homologous to the jugal bone of other tetrapods.\n\n\n===
    Non-mammalian vertebrates ===\n\n\nIn non-mammalian vertebrates, the zygomatic
    bone is referred to as the jugal bone, since these animals have no zygomatic
    arch. \n\nIt is found in most reptiles, amphibians, and birds. \n\nIt is connected
    to the quadratojugal and maxilla, as well as other bones, which may vary by species.\nThis
    bone is considered key in the determination of general traits of the skull, as
    in the case of creatures, such as dinosaurs in paleontology, whose entire skull
    has not been found. \n\nIn coelacanths and early tetrapods the bone is relatively
    large. \n\nHere, it is a plate-like bone forming the lower margin of the orbit
    and much of the side of the face. \n\nIn ray-finned fishes it is reduced or absent,
    and the entire cheek region is generally small. \n\nThe bone is also absent in
    living amphibians.With the exception of turtles, the jugal bone in reptiles forms
    a relatively narrow bar separating the orbit from the inferior temporal fenestra,
    of which it may also form the lower boundary. \n\nThe bone is similarly reduced
    in birds. \n\nIn mammals, it takes on broadly the form seen in humans, with the
    bar between the orbit and fenestra vanishing entirely, and only the lower boundary
    of the fenestra remaining, as the zygomatic arch.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zygomatic_bone"

  descriptionText: "\n\nPHALANX\n\n\nThe phalanx (Ancient Greek: \u03C6\u03AC\u03BB\u03B1\u03B3\u03BE;
    plural phalanxes or phalanges, \u03C6\u03AC\u03BB\u03B1\u03B3\u03B3\u03B5\u03C2,
    phalanges) was a rectangular mass military formation, usually composed entirely
    of heavy infantry armed with spears, pikes, sarissas, or similar pole weapons.
    \n\nThe term is particularly used to describe the use of this formation in Ancient
    Greek warfare, although the ancient Greek writers used it to also describe any
    massed infantry formation, regardless of its equipment. \n\nArrian uses the term
    in his Array against the Alans when he refers to his legions. \n\nIn Greek texts,
    the phalanx may be deployed for battle, on the march, or even camped, thus describing
    the mass of infantry or cavalry that would deploy in line during battle. \n\nThey
    marched forward as one entity. \nThe term itself, as used today, does not refer
    to a distinctive military unit or division (e.g., the Roman legion or the contemporary
    Western-type battalion), but to the type of formation of an army's troops. \n\nTherefore,
    this term does not indicate a standard combat strength or composition but includes
    the total number of infantry, which is deployed in a single formation known as
    a \"phalanx\".\nMany spear-armed troops historically fought in what might be
    termed phalanx-like formations. \n\nThis article focuses on the use of the military
    phalanx formation in Ancient Greece, the Hellenistic world, and other ancient
    states heavily influenced by Greek civilization.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe earliest
    known depiction of a phalanx-like formation occurs in a Sumerian stele from the
    25th century BC. \n\nHere the troops seem to have been equipped with spears,
    helmets, and large shields covering the whole body. \n\nAncient Egyptian infantry
    were known to have employed similar formations. \n\nThe first usage of the term
    phalanx comes from Homer's \"\u03C6\u03B1\u03BB\u03B1\u03B3\u03BE\", used to
    describe hoplites fighting in an organized battle line. \n\nHomer used the term
    to differentiate the formation-based combat from the individual duels so often
    found in his poems.Historians have not arrived at a consensus about the relationship
    between the Greek formation and these predecessors of the hoplites. \n\nThe principles
    of shield wall and spear hedge were almost universally known among the armies
    of major civilizations throughout history, and so the similarities may be related
    to convergent evolution instead of diffusion.\nTraditionally, historians date
    the origin of the hoplite phalanx of ancient Greece to the 8th century BC in
    Sparta, but this is under revision. \n\nIt is perhaps more likely that the formation
    was devised in the 7th century BC after the introduction of the aspis by the
    city of Argos, which would have made the formation possible. \n\nThis is further
    evidenced by the Chigi vase, dated to 650 BC, identifying hoplites armed with
    aspis, spear and panoply.Another possible theory as to the birth of Greek phalanx
    warfare stems from the idea that some of the basic aspects of the phalanx were
    present in earlier times yet were not fully developed due to the lack of appropriate
    technology. \n\nTwo of the basic tactics seen in earlier warfare include the
    principle of cohesion and the use of large groups of soldiers. \n\nThis would
    suggest that the Greek phalanx was rather the culmination and perfection of a
    slowly developed idea that originated many years earlier. \n\nAs weaponry and
    armour advanced through the years in different city-states, the phalanx became
    complex and effective.\n\n\n== Overview ==\n\nThe hoplite phalanx of the Archaic
    and Classical periods in Greece (c. 800\u2013350 BC) was the formation in which
    the hoplites would line up in ranks in close order. \n\nThe hoplites would lock
    their shields together, and the first few ranks of soldiers would project their
    spears out over the first rank of shields. \n\nThe phalanx therefore presented
    a shield wall and a mass of spear points to the enemy, making frontal assaults
    against it very difficult. \n\nIt also allowed a higher proportion of the soldiers
    to be actively engaged in combat at a given time (rather than just those in the
    front rank).\nBattles between two phalanxes usually took place in open, flat
    plains where it was easier to advance and stay in formation. \n\nRough terrain
    or hilly regions would have made it difficult to maintain a steady line and would
    have defeated the purpose of a phalanx. \n\nAs a result, battles between Greek
    city-states would not take place in just any location, nor would they be limited
    to sometimes obvious strategic points. \n\nRather, many times, the two opposing
    sides would find the most suitable piece of land where the conflict could be
    settled. \n\nTypically, the battle ended with one of the two fighting forces
    fleeing to safety.The phalanx usually advanced at a walking pace, although it
    is possible that they picked up speed during the last several yards. \n\nOne
    of the main reasons for this slow approach was to maintain formation. \n\nThe
    formation would be rendered useless if the phalanx was lost as the unit approached
    the enemy and could even become detrimental to the advancing unit, resulting
    in a weaker formation that was easier for an enemy force to break through. \n\nIf
    the hoplites of the phalanx were to pick up speed toward the latter part of the
    advance, it would have been for the purpose of gaining momentum against the enemy
    in the initial collision. \n\nHerodotus states of the Greeks at the Battle of
    Marathon, that \"They were the first Greeks we know of to charge their enemy
    at a run\". \n\nMany historians believe that this innovation was precipitated
    by their desire to minimize their losses from Persian archery. \n\nThe opposing
    sides would collide, possibly severing many of the spears of the row in front
    and killing the front part of the enemy army due to the bone-breaking collision.\nThe
    spears of a phalanx had spiked butts. \n\nIn battle, the back ranks used the
    spikes to finish fallen enemy soldiers.\n\n\n=== Pushing ===\n\nThe \"physical
    pushing match\" theory is one where the battle would rely on the valour of the
    men in the front line, whilst those in the rear maintained forward pressure on
    the front ranks with their shields, and the whole formation would consistently
    press forward trying to break the enemy formation. \n\nThis is the most widely
    accepted interpretation of the ancient sources thus when two phalanx formations
    engaged, the struggle essentially became a pushing match. \n\nHistorians such
    as Victor Davis Hanson point out that it is difficult to account for exceptionally
    deep phalanx formations unless they were necessary to facilitate the physical
    pushing depicted by this theory, as those behind the first two ranks could not
    take part in the actual spear thrusting.No Greek art ever depicts anything like
    a phalanx pushing match, so this hypothesis is a product of educated speculation
    rather than explicit testimony from contemporary sources and is far from being
    academically resolved. \n\nThe Greek term for \"push\" was used in the same metaphorical
    manner as the English word is (for example it was also used to describe the process
    of rhetorical arguments) and so does not necessarily describe a literal physical
    push, although it is possible that it did.\nFor instance, if Othismos were to
    accurately describe a physical pushing match, it would be logical to state that
    the deeper phalanx would always win an engagement since the physical strength
    of individuals would not compensate for even one additional rank on the enemy
    side. \n\nHowever, there are numerous examples of shallow phalanxes holding off
    an opponent. \n\nFor instance, at Delium in 424 BC, the Athenian left flank,
    a formation eight men deep, held off a formation of Thebans 25 deep without immediate
    collapse. \n\nIt is difficult with the physical pushing model to imagine eight
    men withstanding the pushing force of 25 opponents for a matter of seconds, let
    alone half the battle.\nSuch arguments have led to a wave of counter-criticism
    to physical shoving theorists. \n\nAdrian Goldsworthy, in his article \"The Othismos,
    Myths and Heresies: The nature of Hoplite Battle\", argues that the physical
    pushing match model does not fit with the average casualty figures of hoplite
    warfare nor the practical realities of moving large formations of men in battle.
    \n\nThis debate has yet to be resolved amongst scholars.\nPractical difficulties
    with this theory also include the fact that, in a shoving match, an eight-foot
    spear is too long to fight effectively or even parry attacks. \n\nSpears enable
    a formation of men to keep their enemies at a distance, parry attacks aimed at
    them and their comrades, and give the necessary reach to strike multiple men
    in the opposite formation. \n\nA pushing match would put enemies so close together
    that a quick stabbing with a knife would kill the front row almost instantly.
    \n\nThe crush of men would also prevent the formation from withdrawing or retreating,
    which would result in much higher casualties than is recorded. \n\nThe speed
    at which this would occur would also end the battle very quickly, instead of
    prolonging it for hours.\n\n\n=== Shields ===\n\nEach individual hoplite carried
    his shield on his left arm, protecting not only himself but also the soldier
    to the left. \n\nThis meant that the men at the extreme right of the phalanx
    were only half-protected. \n\nIn battle, opposing phalanxes would try to exploit
    this weakness by attempting to overlap the enemy's right flank. \n\nIt also meant
    that, in battle, a phalanx would tend to drift to the right (as hoplites sought
    to remain behind the shield of their neighbor). \n\nSome groups, such as the
    Spartans at Nemea, tried to use this phenomenon to their advantage. \n\nIn this
    case, the phalanx would sacrifice its left side, which typically consisted of
    allied troops, in an effort to overtake the enemy from the flank. \n\nIt is unlikely
    that this strategy worked very often, as it is not mentioned frequently in ancient
    Greek literature.There was a leader in each row of a phalanx, and a rear rank
    officer, the ouragos (meaning tail-leader), who kept order in the rear. \n\nThe
    hoplites had to trust their neighbors to protect them and in turn be willing
    to protect their neighbors; a phalanx was thus only as strong as its weakest
    elements. \n\nThe effectiveness of the phalanx therefore depended on how well
    the hoplites could maintain this formation in combat and how well they could
    stand their ground, especially when engaged against another phalanx. \n\nFor
    this reason, the formation was deliberately organized to group friends and family
    close together, thus providing a psychological incentive to support one's fellows,
    and a disincentive, through shame, to panic or attempt to flee. \n\nThe more
    disciplined and courageous the army, the more likely it was to win \u2013 often
    engagements between the various city-states of Greece would be resolved by one
    side fleeing before the battle. \n\nThe Greek word dynamis, the 'will to fight',
    expresses the drive that kept hoplites in formation.\n\nNow of those, who dare,
    abiding one beside another, to advance to the close fray, and the foremost champions,
    fewer die, and they save the people in the rear; but in men that fear, all excellence
    is lost. \n\nNo one could ever in words go through those several ills, which
    befall a man, if he has been actuated by cowardice. \n\nFor 'tis grievous to
    wound in the rear the back of a flying man in hostile war. \n\nShameful too is
    a corpse lying low in the dust, wounded behind in the back by the point of a
    spear.\n\n\n=== Hoplite armament ===\n\nEach hoplite provided his own equipment.
    \n\nThe primary hoplite weapon was a spear around 2.4 metres (7.9 ft) in length
    called a dory. \n\nAlthough accounts of its length vary, it is usually now believed
    to have been seven to nine feet long (~2.1\u20132.7 m). \n\nIt was held one-handed,
    with the other hand holding the hoplite's shield (aspis). \n\nThe spearhead was
    usually a curved leaf shape, while the rear of the spear had a spike called a
    sauroter ('lizard-killer') which was used to stand the spear in the ground (hence
    the name). \n\nIt was also used as a secondary weapon if the main shaft snapped
    or to kill enemies lying on the ground. \n\nThis was a common problem, especially
    for soldiers who were involved in the initial clash with the enemy. \n\nDespite
    the snapping of the spear, hoplites could easily switch to the sauroter without
    great consequence. \n\nThe rear ranks used the secondary end to finish off fallen
    opponents as the phalanx advanced over them.\nThroughout the hoplite era, the
    standard hoplite armour went through many cyclical changes. \n\nAn Archaic hoplite
    typically wore a bronze breastplate, a bronze helmet with cheekplates, as well
    as greaves and other armour. \n\nLater, in the classical period, the breastplate
    became less common, replaced instead with a corselet that some claim was made
    of linothorax (layers of linen glued together), or perhaps of leather, sometimes
    covered in whole or in part with overlapping metal scales. \n\nEventually, even
    greaves became less commonly used, although degrees of heavier armour remained,
    as attested by Xenophon as late as 401 BC.These changes reflected the balancing
    of mobility with protection, especially as cavalry became more prominent in the
    Peloponnesian War and the need to combat light troops, which were increasingly
    used to negate the hoplite's role as the primary force in battle. \n\nYet bronze
    armour remained in some form until the end of the hoplite era. \n\nSome archaeologists
    have pointed out that bronze armour does not actually provide as much protection
    from direct blows as more extensive corselet padding, and have suggested its
    continued use was a matter of status for those who could afford it. \n\nIn the
    classical Greek dialect, there is no word for swordsmen; yet hoplites also carried
    a short sword called the xiphos, used as a secondary weapon if the dory was broken
    or lost. \n\nSamples of the xiphos recovered at excavation sites were typically
    around 60 cm (24 in) in length. \n\nThese swords were double-edged and could
    therefore be used as a cutting and thrusting weapon. \n\nThese short swords were
    often used to stab or cut at the enemy's neck during close combat.Hoplites carried
    a circular shield called a hoplon (often referred to as an aspis) made from wood
    and covered in bronze, measuring roughly 1 metre (3.3 ft) in diameter. \n\nIt
    spanned from chin to knee and was very heavy (8\u201315 kg (18\u201333 lb)).
    \n\nThis medium-sized shield (fairly large for the period considering the average
    male height) was made possible partly by its dish-like shape, which allowed it
    to be supported with the rim on the shoulder. \n\nThis was quite an important
    feature of the shield, especially for the hoplites that remained in the latter
    ranks. \n\nWhile these soldiers continued to help press forward, they did not
    have the added burden of holding up their shield. \n\nBut the circular shield
    was not without its disadvantages. \n\nDespite its mobility, protective curve,
    and double straps the circular shape created gaps in the shield wall at both
    its top and bottom. (Top gaps were somewhat reduced by the one or two spears
    jutting out of the gap. \n\nIn order to minimize the bottom gaps, thick leather
    'curtains' were used but only by an [unknown] percentage of the hoplites, possibly
    mostly in the first row only since there were disadvantages as well: considerable
    added weight on an already heavy shield and a certain additional cost.) These
    gaps left parts of the hoplite exposed to potentially lethal spear thrusts and
    were a persistent vulnerability for hoplites controlling the front lines.\n\n\n===
    Phalangite armament ===\n\nThe phalanx of the Ancient Macedonian kingdom and
    the later Hellenistic successor states was a development of the hoplite phalanx.
    \n\nThe 'phalangites' were armed with a much longer spear, the sarissa, and less
    heavily armoured. \n\nThe sarissa was the pike used by the ancient Macedonian
    army. \n\nIts actual length is unknown, but apparently it was twice as long as
    the dory. \n\nThis makes it at least 14 feet (4.3 m), but 18 feet (5.5 m) appears
    more likely. (The cavalry xyston was 12.5 feet (3.8 m) by comparison.) The great
    length of the pike was balanced by a counterweight at the rear end, which also
    functioned as a butt-spike, allowing the sarissa to be planted into the ground.
    \n\nBecause of its great length, weight and different balance, a sarissa was
    wielded two-handed. \n\nThis meant that the aspis was no longer a practical defence.
    \n\nInstead, the phalangites strapped a smaller pelte shield (usually reserved
    for peltasts, light skirmishers) to their left forearm. \n\nRecent theories,
    including examination of ancient frescoes depicting full sets of weapons and
    armor, claim that the shields used were actually larger than the pelte but smaller
    than the aspis, hanging by leather strap(s) from the left shoulder or from both
    shoulders. \n\nThe shield would retain handling straps in the inner curve, to
    be handled like a (smaller) aspis if the fight progressed to sword-wielding.
    \n\nAlthough in both shield size assumptions this reduced the shield wall, the
    extreme length of the spear kept the enemy at a greater distance, as the pikes
    of the first three to five ranks could all be brought to bear in front of the
    front row. \n\nThis pike had to be held underhand, as the shield would have obscured
    the soldier's vision had it been held overhead. \n\nIt would also be very hard
    to remove a sarissa from anything it stuck in (the earth, shields, and soldiers
    of the opposition) if it were thrust downwards, due to its length. \n\nThe Macedonian
    phalanx was much less able to form a shield wall, but the lengthened spears would
    have compensated for this. \n\nSuch a phalanx formation also reduced the likelihood
    that battles would degenerate into a pushing match.\n\n\n== Deployment and combat
    ==\n\n=== Phalanx composition and strength ===\n\nThe basic combat element of
    the Greek armies was either the stichos (meaning 'file'; usually 8\u201316 men
    strong) or the enomotia (meaning 'sworn' and made up by 2\u20134 stich\u0153,
    totaling up to 32 men), both led by a dim\u0153rites who was assisted by a decadarchos
    and two decaster\u0153 (sing. decasteros). \n\nFour to a maximum of 32 enomoti\xE6
    (depending on the era in question or the city) were forming a lochos led by a
    lochagos, who in this way was in command of initially 100 hoplites to a maximum
    of c. 500 in the late Hellenistic armies. \n\nHere, it has to be noted that the
    military manuals of Asclepiodotus and Aelian use the term lochos to denote a
    file in the phalanx. \n\nA taxis (mora for the Spartans) was the greatest standard
    hoplitic formation of 500 to 1500 men, led by a strategos (general). \n\nThe
    entire army, a total of several taxeis or mor\xE6 was led by a generals' council.
    \n\nThe commander-in-chief was usually called a polemarchos or a strategos autocrator.\n\n\n===
    Phalanx front and depth ===\n\nHoplite phalanxes usually deployed in ranks of
    eight men or more deep; the Macedonian phalanxes were usually 16 men deep, sometimes
    reported to have been arrayed 32 men deep. \n\nThere are some notable extremes;
    at the battles of Leuctra and Mantinea, the Theban general Epaminondas arranged
    the left wing of the phalanx into a \"hammerhead\" of 50 ranks of elite hoplites
    deep (see below) and when depth was less important, phalanxes just four deep
    are recorded, as at the battle of Marathon.The phalanx depth could vary depending
    on the needs of the moment and plans of the general. \n\nWhile the phalanx was
    in march, an eis bathos formation (loose, meaning literally 'in depth') was adopted
    in order to move more freely and maintain order. \n\nThis was also the initial
    battle formation as, in addition, it permitted friendly units to pass through
    whether assaulting or retreating. \n\nIn this status, the phalanx had twice the
    normal depth and each hoplite had to occupy about 1.8\u20132 metres (5 ft 11
    in\u20136 ft 7 in) in width. \n\nWhen enemy infantry was approaching, a rapid
    switch to the pycne (spelled also pucne) formation (dense or tight formation)
    was necessary. \n\nIn that case, each man's space was halved (0.9\u20131 metre
    or 2 feet 11 inches\u20133 feet 3 inches in width) and the formation depth returned
    to normal. \n\nAn even denser formation, the synaspismos or sunaspismos (ultra-tight
    or locked shields formation), was used when the phalanx was expected to experience
    extra pressure, intense missile volleys or frontal cavalry charges. \n\nIn synaspismos,
    the rank depth was half that of a normal phalanx and the width each man occupied
    was as small as 0.45 metres (1.5 ft).\n\n\n=== Stages of combat ===\n\nSeveral
    stages in hoplite combat can be defined:\nEphodos: The hoplites stop singing
    their p\xE6anes (battle hymns) and move towards the enemy, gradually picking
    up pace and momentum. \n\nIn the instants before impact, war cries (alalagm\u0153,
    sing. alalagmos) would be made. \n\nNotable war cries were the Athenian (eleleleleu!
    eleleleleu!) and the Macedonian (alalalalai! alalalalai!) alalagm\u0153.\nKrousis:
    The opposing phalanxes meet each other almost simultaneously along their front.
    \nDoratismos: Repeated, rapid spear thrusts in order to disrupt the enemy formation.
    \n\nThe use of long spears would keep enemies apart as well as allow men in a
    row to assist their comrades next to them. \n\nThe prodding could also open up
    a man to allow a comrade to spear him. \n\nToo hard prodding could get a spear
    stuck in a shield, which would necessitate someone in the back to lend his to
    the now-disarmed man.\nOthismos: Literally 'pushing' after most spears have been
    broken, the hoplites begin to push with their spears and spear shafts against
    their opponents' shields. \n\nThis could be the longest phase.Pararrhexis: 'Breaching'
    the opposing phalanx, the enemy formation shatters and the battle ends. \n\nCavalry
    would be used at this point to mop up the scattered enemy.\n\n\n== Tactics ==\n\nThe
    early history of the phalanx is largely one of combat between hoplite armies
    from competing Greek city-states. \n\nThe usual result was rather identical,
    inflexible formations pushing against each other until one broke. \n\nThe potential
    of the phalanx to achieve something more was demonstrated at Battle of Marathon
    (490 BC). \n\nFacing the much larger army of Darius I, the Athenians thinned
    out their phalanx and consequently lengthened their front, to avoid being outflanked.
    \n\nHowever, even a reduced-depth phalanx proved unstoppable to the lightly armed
    Persian infantry. \n\nAfter routing the Persian wings, the hoplites on the Athenian
    wings wheeled inwards, destroying the elite troop at the Persian centre, resulting
    in a crushing victory for Athens. \n\nThroughout the Greco-Persian Wars the hoplite
    phalanx was to prove superior to the Persian infantry (e.g. the battles of Thermopylae
    and Plataea).\nPerhaps the most prominent example of the phalanx's evolution
    was the oblique order, made famous in the Battle of Leuctra. \n\nThere, the Theban
    general Epaminondas thinned out the right flank and centre of his phalanx, and
    deepened his left flank to an unheard-of 50 men deep. \n\nIn doing so, Epaminondas
    reversed the convention by which the right flank of the phalanx was strongest.
    \n\nThis allowed the Thebans to assault in strength the elite Spartan troops
    on the right flank of the opposing phalanx. \n\nMeanwhile, the centre and right
    flank of the Theban line were echeloned back, from the opposing phalanx, keeping
    the weakened parts of the formation from being engaged. \n\nOnce the Spartan
    right had been routed by the Theban left, the remainder of the Spartan line also
    broke. \n\nThus, by localising the attacking power of the hoplites, Epaminondas
    was able to defeat an enemy previously thought invincible.\nPhilip II of Macedon
    spent several years in Thebes as a hostage, and paid attention to Epaminondas'
    innovations. \n\nOn return to his homeland, he raised a revolutionary new infantry
    force, which was to change the face of the Greek world. \n\nPhilip's phalangites
    were the first force of professional soldiers seen in Ancient Greece apart from
    Sparta. \n\nThey were armed with longer spears (the sarissa) and were drilled
    more thoroughly in more evolved, complicated tactics and manoeuvres. \n\nMore
    importantly, though, Philip's phalanx was part of a multi-faceted, combined force
    that included a variety of skirmishers and cavalry, most notably the famous Companion
    cavalry. \n\nThe Macedonian phalanx now was used to pin the centre of the enemy
    line, while cavalry and more mobile infantry struck at the foe's flanks. \n\nIts
    supremacy over the more static armies fielded by the Greek city-states was shown
    at the Battle of Chaeronea, where Philip II's army crushed the allied Theban
    and Athenian phalanxes.\n\n\n== Weaknesses ==\n\nThe hoplite phalanx was weakest
    when facing an enemy fielding lighter and more flexible troops without its own
    such supporting troops. \n\nAn example of this would be the Battle of Lechaeum,
    where an Athenian contingent led by Iphicrates routed an entire Spartan mora
    (a unit of anywhere from 500 to 900 hoplites). \n\nThe Athenian force had a considerable
    proportion of light missile troops armed with javelins and bows that wore down
    the Spartans with repeated attacks, causing disarray in the Spartan ranks and
    an eventual rout when they spotted Athenian heavy infantry reinforcements trying
    to flank them by boat.\nThe Macedonian phalanx had weaknesses similar to its
    hoplitic predecessor. \n\nTheoretically indestructible from the front, its flanks
    and rear were very vulnerable, and once engaged it may not easily disengage or
    redeploy to face a threat from those directions. \n\nThus, a phalanx facing non-phalangite
    formations required some sort of protection on its flanks\u2014lighter or at
    least more mobile infantry, cavalry, etc. \n\nThis was shown at the Battle of
    Magnesia, where, once the Seleucid supporting cavalry elements were driven off,
    the phalanx was static and unable to go on the offensive against its Roman opponents
    (although they continued to resist stoutly and attempted a fighting withdrawal
    under a hail of Roman missiles, until the elephants posted on their flanks panicked
    and disrupted their formation).\nThe Macedonian phalanx could also lose its cohesion
    without proper coordination or while moving through broken terrain; doing so
    could create gaps between individual blocks/syntagmata, or could prevent a solid
    front within those sub-units as well, causing other sections of the line to bunch
    up. \n\nIn this event, as in the battles of Cynoscephalae and Pydna, the phalanx
    became vulnerable to attacks by more flexible units\u2014such as Roman legionary
    centuries, which were able to avoid the sarissae and engage in hand-to-hand combat
    with the phalangites.\nAnother important area that must be considered concerns
    the psychological tendencies of the hoplites. \n\nBecause the strength of a phalanx
    depended on the ability of the hoplites to maintain their frontline, it was crucial
    that a phalanx be able to quickly and efficiently replace fallen soldiers in
    the front ranks. \n\nIf a phalanx failed to do this in a structured manner, the
    opposing phalanx would have an opportunity to breach the line which, many times,
    would lead to a quick defeat. \n\nThis then implies that the hoplites ranks closer
    to the front must be mentally prepared to replace their fallen comrade and adapt
    to his new position without disrupting the structure of the frontline.Finally,
    most of the phalanx-centric armies tended to lack supporting echelons behind
    the main line of battle. \n\nThis meant that breaking through the line of battle
    or compromising one of its flanks often ensured victory.\n\n\n== Classical decline
    and post-classical use ==\n\nAfter reaching its zenith in the conquests of Alexander
    the Great, the phalanx began a slow decline, as Macedonian successor states declined.
    \n\nThe combined arms tactics used by Alexander and his father were gradually
    replaced by a return to the simpler frontal charge tactics of the hoplite phalanx.
    \n\nThe expense of the supporting arms and cavalry, and the widespread use of
    mercenaries, caused the Diadochi to rely on phalanx vs. phalanx tactics during
    the Wars of the Diadochi.\nThe decline of the Diadochi and the phalanx was linked
    with the rise of Rome and the Roman legions from the 3rd century BC. \n\nThe
    Battle of the Caudine Forks showed the clumsiness of the Roman phalanx against
    the Samnites. \n\nThe Romans had originally employed the phalanx themselves but
    gradually evolved more flexible tactics. \n\nThe result was the three-line Roman
    legion of the middle period of the Roman Republic, the Manipular System. \n\nRomans
    used a phalanx for their third military line, the triarii. \n\nThese were veteran
    reserve troops armed with the hastae or spear. \n\nRome conquered most of the
    Macedonian successor states. \n\nAlso the various Greek city-states and leagues.
    \n\nAs these states ceased to exist, so did the armies which used the traditional
    phalanx. \n\nSubsequently, troops from these regions were equipped, trained and
    fought using the Roman model.\nA phalanx formation called the phoulkon appeared
    in the late Roman army and Byzantine army. \n\nIt had characteristics of the
    classical Greek and Hellenistic phalanxes, but was more flexible. \n\nIt was
    used against cavalry more than infantry.\nHowever, the phalanx did not totally
    disappear. \n\nIn some battles between the Roman army and Hellenistic phalanxes,
    such as Pydna (168 BC), Cynoscephalae (197 BC) and Magnesia (190 BC), the phalanx
    performed well. \n\nIt even drove back the Roman infantry. \n\nHowever, at Cynoscephalae
    and Magnesia, failure to defend the flanks of the phalanx led to defeat. \n\nAt
    Pydna, the phalanx lost cohesion when pursuing retreating Roman soldiers. \n\nThis
    allowed the Romans to penetrate the formation. \n\nThen, Roman close combat skills
    proved decisive. \n\nThe historian Polybius details the effectiveness of the
    Roman legion against the phalanx. \n\nHe deduces that the Romans refused to fight
    the phalanx where the phalanx was effective, Romans offered battle only when
    a legion could exploit the clumsiness and immobility of a phalanx.\n\nSpear-armed
    troops continued to be important elements in many armies until reliable firearms
    became available. \n\nThese did not necessarily fight as a phalanx. \n\nFor example,
    compare the classical phalanx and late medieval pike formations.Military historians
    have suggested that the Scots under William Wallace and Robert the Bruce consciously
    imitated the Hellenistic phalanx to produce the Scots 'hedgehog' or schiltron.
    \n\nHowever, long spears might have been used by Picts and others in Scotlands'
    Early Middle Ages. \n\nPrior to 1066, long spear tactics (also found in North
    Wales) might have been part of irregular warfare in Britain. \n\nThe Scots used
    imported French pikes and dynamic tactics at the Battle of Flodden. \n\nHowever,
    Flodden found the Scots pitted against effective light artillery, while advancing
    over bad ground. \n\nThe combination disorganised the Scotts phalanxes and permitted
    effective attacks by English longbowmen, and soldiers wielding shorter, handier
    polearms called bills. \n\nSome contemporary sources might say that the bills
    cut off the heads of Scots pikes.\nThe pike was briefly reconsidered as a weapon
    by European armies in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. \n\nIt could protect
    riflemen, whose slower rate of fire made them vulnerable. \n\nA collapsible pike
    was invented but never issued. \n\nThe Confederate Army considered these for
    the American Civil War. \n\nSome were even manufactured but probably were never
    issued. \n\nPikes were manufactured during World War II as \"Croft's Pikes\".\nWhile
    obsolete in military practice, the phalanx remained in use as a metaphor of warriors
    moving forward as a single united block. \n\nThis metaphor inspired several 20th-century
    political movements, notably the Spanish Falange and its ideology of Falangism.\nThe
    Byzantines continued and improved the use of the classical Greek phalanx alongside
    the Macedonian-style phalanx. \n\nThe latter was based on a model that Alexander
    himself had created and had tried to give more importance to the skirmishers
    and cavalry, yet it never saw action until the Byzantines adopted the model that
    rely in a mixture of many units sometimes. \n\nMany writers of the age describe
    the spear as being a sarissa yet it was a meter short than the original sarissa
    and had being modified by the time, yet the term for the long spear remained
    alongside with its other names.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phalanx"

  descriptionText: "\n\nPHALANX\n\n\nThe phalanx (Ancient Greek: \u03C6\u03AC\u03BB\u03B1\u03B3\u03BE;
    plural phalanxes or phalanges, \u03C6\u03AC\u03BB\u03B1\u03B3\u03B3\u03B5\u03C2,
    phalanges) was a rectangular mass military formation, usually composed entirely
    of heavy infantry armed with spears, pikes, sarissas, or similar pole weapons.
    \n\nThe term is particularly used to describe the use of this formation in Ancient
    Greek warfare, although the ancient Greek writers used it to also describe any
    massed infantry formation, regardless of its equipment. \n\nArrian uses the term
    in his Array against the Alans when he refers to his legions. \n\nIn Greek texts,
    the phalanx may be deployed for battle, on the march, or even camped, thus describing
    the mass of infantry or cavalry that would deploy in line during battle. \n\nThey
    marched forward as one entity. \nThe term itself, as used today, does not refer
    to a distinctive military unit or division (e.g., the Roman legion or the contemporary
    Western-type battalion), but to the type of formation of an army's troops. \n\nTherefore,
    this term does not indicate a standard combat strength or composition but includes
    the total number of infantry, which is deployed in a single formation known as
    a \"phalanx\".\nMany spear-armed troops historically fought in what might be
    termed phalanx-like formations. \n\nThis article focuses on the use of the military
    phalanx formation in Ancient Greece, the Hellenistic world, and other ancient
    states heavily influenced by Greek civilization.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe earliest
    known depiction of a phalanx-like formation occurs in a Sumerian stele from the
    25th century BC. \n\nHere the troops seem to have been equipped with spears,
    helmets, and large shields covering the whole body. \n\nAncient Egyptian infantry
    were known to have employed similar formations. \n\nThe first usage of the term
    phalanx comes from Homer's \"\u03C6\u03B1\u03BB\u03B1\u03B3\u03BE\", used to
    describe hoplites fighting in an organized battle line. \n\nHomer used the term
    to differentiate the formation-based combat from the individual duels so often
    found in his poems.Historians have not arrived at a consensus about the relationship
    between the Greek formation and these predecessors of the hoplites. \n\nThe principles
    of shield wall and spear hedge were almost universally known among the armies
    of major civilizations throughout history, and so the similarities may be related
    to convergent evolution instead of diffusion.\nTraditionally, historians date
    the origin of the hoplite phalanx of ancient Greece to the 8th century BC in
    Sparta, but this is under revision. \n\nIt is perhaps more likely that the formation
    was devised in the 7th century BC after the introduction of the aspis by the
    city of Argos, which would have made the formation possible. \n\nThis is further
    evidenced by the Chigi vase, dated to 650 BC, identifying hoplites armed with
    aspis, spear and panoply.Another possible theory as to the birth of Greek phalanx
    warfare stems from the idea that some of the basic aspects of the phalanx were
    present in earlier times yet were not fully developed due to the lack of appropriate
    technology. \n\nTwo of the basic tactics seen in earlier warfare include the
    principle of cohesion and the use of large groups of soldiers. \n\nThis would
    suggest that the Greek phalanx was rather the culmination and perfection of a
    slowly developed idea that originated many years earlier. \n\nAs weaponry and
    armour advanced through the years in different city-states, the phalanx became
    complex and effective.\n\n\n== Overview ==\n\nThe hoplite phalanx of the Archaic
    and Classical periods in Greece (c. 800\u2013350 BC) was the formation in which
    the hoplites would line up in ranks in close order. \n\nThe hoplites would lock
    their shields together, and the first few ranks of soldiers would project their
    spears out over the first rank of shields. \n\nThe phalanx therefore presented
    a shield wall and a mass of spear points to the enemy, making frontal assaults
    against it very difficult. \n\nIt also allowed a higher proportion of the soldiers
    to be actively engaged in combat at a given time (rather than just those in the
    front rank).\nBattles between two phalanxes usually took place in open, flat
    plains where it was easier to advance and stay in formation. \n\nRough terrain
    or hilly regions would have made it difficult to maintain a steady line and would
    have defeated the purpose of a phalanx. \n\nAs a result, battles between Greek
    city-states would not take place in just any location, nor would they be limited
    to sometimes obvious strategic points. \n\nRather, many times, the two opposing
    sides would find the most suitable piece of land where the conflict could be
    settled. \n\nTypically, the battle ended with one of the two fighting forces
    fleeing to safety.The phalanx usually advanced at a walking pace, although it
    is possible that they picked up speed during the last several yards. \n\nOne
    of the main reasons for this slow approach was to maintain formation. \n\nThe
    formation would be rendered useless if the phalanx was lost as the unit approached
    the enemy and could even become detrimental to the advancing unit, resulting
    in a weaker formation that was easier for an enemy force to break through. \n\nIf
    the hoplites of the phalanx were to pick up speed toward the latter part of the
    advance, it would have been for the purpose of gaining momentum against the enemy
    in the initial collision. \n\nHerodotus states of the Greeks at the Battle of
    Marathon, that \"They were the first Greeks we know of to charge their enemy
    at a run\". \n\nMany historians believe that this innovation was precipitated
    by their desire to minimize their losses from Persian archery. \n\nThe opposing
    sides would collide, possibly severing many of the spears of the row in front
    and killing the front part of the enemy army due to the bone-breaking collision.\nThe
    spears of a phalanx had spiked butts. \n\nIn battle, the back ranks used the
    spikes to finish fallen enemy soldiers.\n\n\n=== Pushing ===\n\nThe \"physical
    pushing match\" theory is one where the battle would rely on the valour of the
    men in the front line, whilst those in the rear maintained forward pressure on
    the front ranks with their shields, and the whole formation would consistently
    press forward trying to break the enemy formation. \n\nThis is the most widely
    accepted interpretation of the ancient sources thus when two phalanx formations
    engaged, the struggle essentially became a pushing match. \n\nHistorians such
    as Victor Davis Hanson point out that it is difficult to account for exceptionally
    deep phalanx formations unless they were necessary to facilitate the physical
    pushing depicted by this theory, as those behind the first two ranks could not
    take part in the actual spear thrusting.No Greek art ever depicts anything like
    a phalanx pushing match, so this hypothesis is a product of educated speculation
    rather than explicit testimony from contemporary sources and is far from being
    academically resolved. \n\nThe Greek term for \"push\" was used in the same metaphorical
    manner as the English word is (for example it was also used to describe the process
    of rhetorical arguments) and so does not necessarily describe a literal physical
    push, although it is possible that it did.\nFor instance, if Othismos were to
    accurately describe a physical pushing match, it would be logical to state that
    the deeper phalanx would always win an engagement since the physical strength
    of individuals would not compensate for even one additional rank on the enemy
    side. \n\nHowever, there are numerous examples of shallow phalanxes holding off
    an opponent. \n\nFor instance, at Delium in 424 BC, the Athenian left flank,
    a formation eight men deep, held off a formation of Thebans 25 deep without immediate
    collapse. \n\nIt is difficult with the physical pushing model to imagine eight
    men withstanding the pushing force of 25 opponents for a matter of seconds, let
    alone half the battle.\nSuch arguments have led to a wave of counter-criticism
    to physical shoving theorists. \n\nAdrian Goldsworthy, in his article \"The Othismos,
    Myths and Heresies: The nature of Hoplite Battle\", argues that the physical
    pushing match model does not fit with the average casualty figures of hoplite
    warfare nor the practical realities of moving large formations of men in battle.
    \n\nThis debate has yet to be resolved amongst scholars.\nPractical difficulties
    with this theory also include the fact that, in a shoving match, an eight-foot
    spear is too long to fight effectively or even parry attacks. \n\nSpears enable
    a formation of men to keep their enemies at a distance, parry attacks aimed at
    them and their comrades, and give the necessary reach to strike multiple men
    in the opposite formation. \n\nA pushing match would put enemies so close together
    that a quick stabbing with a knife would kill the front row almost instantly.
    \n\nThe crush of men would also prevent the formation from withdrawing or retreating,
    which would result in much higher casualties than is recorded. \n\nThe speed
    at which this would occur would also end the battle very quickly, instead of
    prolonging it for hours.\n\n\n=== Shields ===\n\nEach individual hoplite carried
    his shield on his left arm, protecting not only himself but also the soldier
    to the left. \n\nThis meant that the men at the extreme right of the phalanx
    were only half-protected. \n\nIn battle, opposing phalanxes would try to exploit
    this weakness by attempting to overlap the enemy's right flank. \n\nIt also meant
    that, in battle, a phalanx would tend to drift to the right (as hoplites sought
    to remain behind the shield of their neighbor). \n\nSome groups, such as the
    Spartans at Nemea, tried to use this phenomenon to their advantage. \n\nIn this
    case, the phalanx would sacrifice its left side, which typically consisted of
    allied troops, in an effort to overtake the enemy from the flank. \n\nIt is unlikely
    that this strategy worked very often, as it is not mentioned frequently in ancient
    Greek literature.There was a leader in each row of a phalanx, and a rear rank
    officer, the ouragos (meaning tail-leader), who kept order in the rear. \n\nThe
    hoplites had to trust their neighbors to protect them and in turn be willing
    to protect their neighbors; a phalanx was thus only as strong as its weakest
    elements. \n\nThe effectiveness of the phalanx therefore depended on how well
    the hoplites could maintain this formation in combat and how well they could
    stand their ground, especially when engaged against another phalanx. \n\nFor
    this reason, the formation was deliberately organized to group friends and family
    close together, thus providing a psychological incentive to support one's fellows,
    and a disincentive, through shame, to panic or attempt to flee. \n\nThe more
    disciplined and courageous the army, the more likely it was to win \u2013 often
    engagements between the various city-states of Greece would be resolved by one
    side fleeing before the battle. \n\nThe Greek word dynamis, the 'will to fight',
    expresses the drive that kept hoplites in formation.\n\nNow of those, who dare,
    abiding one beside another, to advance to the close fray, and the foremost champions,
    fewer die, and they save the people in the rear; but in men that fear, all excellence
    is lost. \n\nNo one could ever in words go through those several ills, which
    befall a man, if he has been actuated by cowardice. \n\nFor 'tis grievous to
    wound in the rear the back of a flying man in hostile war. \n\nShameful too is
    a corpse lying low in the dust, wounded behind in the back by the point of a
    spear.\n\n\n=== Hoplite armament ===\n\nEach hoplite provided his own equipment.
    \n\nThe primary hoplite weapon was a spear around 2.4 metres (7.9 ft) in length
    called a dory. \n\nAlthough accounts of its length vary, it is usually now believed
    to have been seven to nine feet long (~2.1\u20132.7 m). \n\nIt was held one-handed,
    with the other hand holding the hoplite's shield (aspis). \n\nThe spearhead was
    usually a curved leaf shape, while the rear of the spear had a spike called a
    sauroter ('lizard-killer') which was used to stand the spear in the ground (hence
    the name). \n\nIt was also used as a secondary weapon if the main shaft snapped
    or to kill enemies lying on the ground. \n\nThis was a common problem, especially
    for soldiers who were involved in the initial clash with the enemy. \n\nDespite
    the snapping of the spear, hoplites could easily switch to the sauroter without
    great consequence. \n\nThe rear ranks used the secondary end to finish off fallen
    opponents as the phalanx advanced over them.\nThroughout the hoplite era, the
    standard hoplite armour went through many cyclical changes. \n\nAn Archaic hoplite
    typically wore a bronze breastplate, a bronze helmet with cheekplates, as well
    as greaves and other armour. \n\nLater, in the classical period, the breastplate
    became less common, replaced instead with a corselet that some claim was made
    of linothorax (layers of linen glued together), or perhaps of leather, sometimes
    covered in whole or in part with overlapping metal scales. \n\nEventually, even
    greaves became less commonly used, although degrees of heavier armour remained,
    as attested by Xenophon as late as 401 BC.These changes reflected the balancing
    of mobility with protection, especially as cavalry became more prominent in the
    Peloponnesian War and the need to combat light troops, which were increasingly
    used to negate the hoplite's role as the primary force in battle. \n\nYet bronze
    armour remained in some form until the end of the hoplite era. \n\nSome archaeologists
    have pointed out that bronze armour does not actually provide as much protection
    from direct blows as more extensive corselet padding, and have suggested its
    continued use was a matter of status for those who could afford it. \n\nIn the
    classical Greek dialect, there is no word for swordsmen; yet hoplites also carried
    a short sword called the xiphos, used as a secondary weapon if the dory was broken
    or lost. \n\nSamples of the xiphos recovered at excavation sites were typically
    around 60 cm (24 in) in length. \n\nThese swords were double-edged and could
    therefore be used as a cutting and thrusting weapon. \n\nThese short swords were
    often used to stab or cut at the enemy's neck during close combat.Hoplites carried
    a circular shield called a hoplon (often referred to as an aspis) made from wood
    and covered in bronze, measuring roughly 1 metre (3.3 ft) in diameter. \n\nIt
    spanned from chin to knee and was very heavy (8\u201315 kg (18\u201333 lb)).
    \n\nThis medium-sized shield (fairly large for the period considering the average
    male height) was made possible partly by its dish-like shape, which allowed it
    to be supported with the rim on the shoulder. \n\nThis was quite an important
    feature of the shield, especially for the hoplites that remained in the latter
    ranks. \n\nWhile these soldiers continued to help press forward, they did not
    have the added burden of holding up their shield. \n\nBut the circular shield
    was not without its disadvantages. \n\nDespite its mobility, protective curve,
    and double straps the circular shape created gaps in the shield wall at both
    its top and bottom. (Top gaps were somewhat reduced by the one or two spears
    jutting out of the gap. \n\nIn order to minimize the bottom gaps, thick leather
    'curtains' were used but only by an [unknown] percentage of the hoplites, possibly
    mostly in the first row only since there were disadvantages as well: considerable
    added weight on an already heavy shield and a certain additional cost.) These
    gaps left parts of the hoplite exposed to potentially lethal spear thrusts and
    were a persistent vulnerability for hoplites controlling the front lines.\n\n\n===
    Phalangite armament ===\n\nThe phalanx of the Ancient Macedonian kingdom and
    the later Hellenistic successor states was a development of the hoplite phalanx.
    \n\nThe 'phalangites' were armed with a much longer spear, the sarissa, and less
    heavily armoured. \n\nThe sarissa was the pike used by the ancient Macedonian
    army. \n\nIts actual length is unknown, but apparently it was twice as long as
    the dory. \n\nThis makes it at least 14 feet (4.3 m), but 18 feet (5.5 m) appears
    more likely. (The cavalry xyston was 12.5 feet (3.8 m) by comparison.) The great
    length of the pike was balanced by a counterweight at the rear end, which also
    functioned as a butt-spike, allowing the sarissa to be planted into the ground.
    \n\nBecause of its great length, weight and different balance, a sarissa was
    wielded two-handed. \n\nThis meant that the aspis was no longer a practical defence.
    \n\nInstead, the phalangites strapped a smaller pelte shield (usually reserved
    for peltasts, light skirmishers) to their left forearm. \n\nRecent theories,
    including examination of ancient frescoes depicting full sets of weapons and
    armor, claim that the shields used were actually larger than the pelte but smaller
    than the aspis, hanging by leather strap(s) from the left shoulder or from both
    shoulders. \n\nThe shield would retain handling straps in the inner curve, to
    be handled like a (smaller) aspis if the fight progressed to sword-wielding.
    \n\nAlthough in both shield size assumptions this reduced the shield wall, the
    extreme length of the spear kept the enemy at a greater distance, as the pikes
    of the first three to five ranks could all be brought to bear in front of the
    front row. \n\nThis pike had to be held underhand, as the shield would have obscured
    the soldier's vision had it been held overhead. \n\nIt would also be very hard
    to remove a sarissa from anything it stuck in (the earth, shields, and soldiers
    of the opposition) if it were thrust downwards, due to its length. \n\nThe Macedonian
    phalanx was much less able to form a shield wall, but the lengthened spears would
    have compensated for this. \n\nSuch a phalanx formation also reduced the likelihood
    that battles would degenerate into a pushing match.\n\n\n== Deployment and combat
    ==\n\n=== Phalanx composition and strength ===\n\nThe basic combat element of
    the Greek armies was either the stichos (meaning 'file'; usually 8\u201316 men
    strong) or the enomotia (meaning 'sworn' and made up by 2\u20134 stich\u0153,
    totaling up to 32 men), both led by a dim\u0153rites who was assisted by a decadarchos
    and two decaster\u0153 (sing. decasteros). \n\nFour to a maximum of 32 enomoti\xE6
    (depending on the era in question or the city) were forming a lochos led by a
    lochagos, who in this way was in command of initially 100 hoplites to a maximum
    of c. 500 in the late Hellenistic armies. \n\nHere, it has to be noted that the
    military manuals of Asclepiodotus and Aelian use the term lochos to denote a
    file in the phalanx. \n\nA taxis (mora for the Spartans) was the greatest standard
    hoplitic formation of 500 to 1500 men, led by a strategos (general). \n\nThe
    entire army, a total of several taxeis or mor\xE6 was led by a generals' council.
    \n\nThe commander-in-chief was usually called a polemarchos or a strategos autocrator.\n\n\n===
    Phalanx front and depth ===\n\nHoplite phalanxes usually deployed in ranks of
    eight men or more deep; the Macedonian phalanxes were usually 16 men deep, sometimes
    reported to have been arrayed 32 men deep. \n\nThere are some notable extremes;
    at the battles of Leuctra and Mantinea, the Theban general Epaminondas arranged
    the left wing of the phalanx into a \"hammerhead\" of 50 ranks of elite hoplites
    deep (see below) and when depth was less important, phalanxes just four deep
    are recorded, as at the battle of Marathon.The phalanx depth could vary depending
    on the needs of the moment and plans of the general. \n\nWhile the phalanx was
    in march, an eis bathos formation (loose, meaning literally 'in depth') was adopted
    in order to move more freely and maintain order. \n\nThis was also the initial
    battle formation as, in addition, it permitted friendly units to pass through
    whether assaulting or retreating. \n\nIn this status, the phalanx had twice the
    normal depth and each hoplite had to occupy about 1.8\u20132 metres (5 ft 11
    in\u20136 ft 7 in) in width. \n\nWhen enemy infantry was approaching, a rapid
    switch to the pycne (spelled also pucne) formation (dense or tight formation)
    was necessary. \n\nIn that case, each man's space was halved (0.9\u20131 metre
    or 2 feet 11 inches\u20133 feet 3 inches in width) and the formation depth returned
    to normal. \n\nAn even denser formation, the synaspismos or sunaspismos (ultra-tight
    or locked shields formation), was used when the phalanx was expected to experience
    extra pressure, intense missile volleys or frontal cavalry charges. \n\nIn synaspismos,
    the rank depth was half that of a normal phalanx and the width each man occupied
    was as small as 0.45 metres (1.5 ft).\n\n\n=== Stages of combat ===\n\nSeveral
    stages in hoplite combat can be defined:\nEphodos: The hoplites stop singing
    their p\xE6anes (battle hymns) and move towards the enemy, gradually picking
    up pace and momentum. \n\nIn the instants before impact, war cries (alalagm\u0153,
    sing. alalagmos) would be made. \n\nNotable war cries were the Athenian (eleleleleu!
    eleleleleu!) and the Macedonian (alalalalai! alalalalai!) alalagm\u0153.\nKrousis:
    The opposing phalanxes meet each other almost simultaneously along their front.
    \nDoratismos: Repeated, rapid spear thrusts in order to disrupt the enemy formation.
    \n\nThe use of long spears would keep enemies apart as well as allow men in a
    row to assist their comrades next to them. \n\nThe prodding could also open up
    a man to allow a comrade to spear him. \n\nToo hard prodding could get a spear
    stuck in a shield, which would necessitate someone in the back to lend his to
    the now-disarmed man.\nOthismos: Literally 'pushing' after most spears have been
    broken, the hoplites begin to push with their spears and spear shafts against
    their opponents' shields. \n\nThis could be the longest phase.Pararrhexis: 'Breaching'
    the opposing phalanx, the enemy formation shatters and the battle ends. \n\nCavalry
    would be used at this point to mop up the scattered enemy.\n\n\n== Tactics ==\n\nThe
    early history of the phalanx is largely one of combat between hoplite armies
    from competing Greek city-states. \n\nThe usual result was rather identical,
    inflexible formations pushing against each other until one broke. \n\nThe potential
    of the phalanx to achieve something more was demonstrated at Battle of Marathon
    (490 BC). \n\nFacing the much larger army of Darius I, the Athenians thinned
    out their phalanx and consequently lengthened their front, to avoid being outflanked.
    \n\nHowever, even a reduced-depth phalanx proved unstoppable to the lightly armed
    Persian infantry. \n\nAfter routing the Persian wings, the hoplites on the Athenian
    wings wheeled inwards, destroying the elite troop at the Persian centre, resulting
    in a crushing victory for Athens. \n\nThroughout the Greco-Persian Wars the hoplite
    phalanx was to prove superior to the Persian infantry (e.g. the battles of Thermopylae
    and Plataea).\nPerhaps the most prominent example of the phalanx's evolution
    was the oblique order, made famous in the Battle of Leuctra. \n\nThere, the Theban
    general Epaminondas thinned out the right flank and centre of his phalanx, and
    deepened his left flank to an unheard-of 50 men deep. \n\nIn doing so, Epaminondas
    reversed the convention by which the right flank of the phalanx was strongest.
    \n\nThis allowed the Thebans to assault in strength the elite Spartan troops
    on the right flank of the opposing phalanx. \n\nMeanwhile, the centre and right
    flank of the Theban line were echeloned back, from the opposing phalanx, keeping
    the weakened parts of the formation from being engaged. \n\nOnce the Spartan
    right had been routed by the Theban left, the remainder of the Spartan line also
    broke. \n\nThus, by localising the attacking power of the hoplites, Epaminondas
    was able to defeat an enemy previously thought invincible.\nPhilip II of Macedon
    spent several years in Thebes as a hostage, and paid attention to Epaminondas'
    innovations. \n\nOn return to his homeland, he raised a revolutionary new infantry
    force, which was to change the face of the Greek world. \n\nPhilip's phalangites
    were the first force of professional soldiers seen in Ancient Greece apart from
    Sparta. \n\nThey were armed with longer spears (the sarissa) and were drilled
    more thoroughly in more evolved, complicated tactics and manoeuvres. \n\nMore
    importantly, though, Philip's phalanx was part of a multi-faceted, combined force
    that included a variety of skirmishers and cavalry, most notably the famous Companion
    cavalry. \n\nThe Macedonian phalanx now was used to pin the centre of the enemy
    line, while cavalry and more mobile infantry struck at the foe's flanks. \n\nIts
    supremacy over the more static armies fielded by the Greek city-states was shown
    at the Battle of Chaeronea, where Philip II's army crushed the allied Theban
    and Athenian phalanxes.\n\n\n== Weaknesses ==\n\nThe hoplite phalanx was weakest
    when facing an enemy fielding lighter and more flexible troops without its own
    such supporting troops. \n\nAn example of this would be the Battle of Lechaeum,
    where an Athenian contingent led by Iphicrates routed an entire Spartan mora
    (a unit of anywhere from 500 to 900 hoplites). \n\nThe Athenian force had a considerable
    proportion of light missile troops armed with javelins and bows that wore down
    the Spartans with repeated attacks, causing disarray in the Spartan ranks and
    an eventual rout when they spotted Athenian heavy infantry reinforcements trying
    to flank them by boat.\nThe Macedonian phalanx had weaknesses similar to its
    hoplitic predecessor. \n\nTheoretically indestructible from the front, its flanks
    and rear were very vulnerable, and once engaged it may not easily disengage or
    redeploy to face a threat from those directions. \n\nThus, a phalanx facing non-phalangite
    formations required some sort of protection on its flanks\u2014lighter or at
    least more mobile infantry, cavalry, etc. \n\nThis was shown at the Battle of
    Magnesia, where, once the Seleucid supporting cavalry elements were driven off,
    the phalanx was static and unable to go on the offensive against its Roman opponents
    (although they continued to resist stoutly and attempted a fighting withdrawal
    under a hail of Roman missiles, until the elephants posted on their flanks panicked
    and disrupted their formation).\nThe Macedonian phalanx could also lose its cohesion
    without proper coordination or while moving through broken terrain; doing so
    could create gaps between individual blocks/syntagmata, or could prevent a solid
    front within those sub-units as well, causing other sections of the line to bunch
    up. \n\nIn this event, as in the battles of Cynoscephalae and Pydna, the phalanx
    became vulnerable to attacks by more flexible units\u2014such as Roman legionary
    centuries, which were able to avoid the sarissae and engage in hand-to-hand combat
    with the phalangites.\nAnother important area that must be considered concerns
    the psychological tendencies of the hoplites. \n\nBecause the strength of a phalanx
    depended on the ability of the hoplites to maintain their frontline, it was crucial
    that a phalanx be able to quickly and efficiently replace fallen soldiers in
    the front ranks. \n\nIf a phalanx failed to do this in a structured manner, the
    opposing phalanx would have an opportunity to breach the line which, many times,
    would lead to a quick defeat. \n\nThis then implies that the hoplites ranks closer
    to the front must be mentally prepared to replace their fallen comrade and adapt
    to his new position without disrupting the structure of the frontline.Finally,
    most of the phalanx-centric armies tended to lack supporting echelons behind
    the main line of battle. \n\nThis meant that breaking through the line of battle
    or compromising one of its flanks often ensured victory.\n\n\n== Classical decline
    and post-classical use ==\n\nAfter reaching its zenith in the conquests of Alexander
    the Great, the phalanx began a slow decline, as Macedonian successor states declined.
    \n\nThe combined arms tactics used by Alexander and his father were gradually
    replaced by a return to the simpler frontal charge tactics of the hoplite phalanx.
    \n\nThe expense of the supporting arms and cavalry, and the widespread use of
    mercenaries, caused the Diadochi to rely on phalanx vs. phalanx tactics during
    the Wars of the Diadochi.\nThe decline of the Diadochi and the phalanx was linked
    with the rise of Rome and the Roman legions from the 3rd century BC. \n\nThe
    Battle of the Caudine Forks showed the clumsiness of the Roman phalanx against
    the Samnites. \n\nThe Romans had originally employed the phalanx themselves but
    gradually evolved more flexible tactics. \n\nThe result was the three-line Roman
    legion of the middle period of the Roman Republic, the Manipular System. \n\nRomans
    used a phalanx for their third military line, the triarii. \n\nThese were veteran
    reserve troops armed with the hastae or spear. \n\nRome conquered most of the
    Macedonian successor states. \n\nAlso the various Greek city-states and leagues.
    \n\nAs these states ceased to exist, so did the armies which used the traditional
    phalanx. \n\nSubsequently, troops from these regions were equipped, trained and
    fought using the Roman model.\nA phalanx formation called the phoulkon appeared
    in the late Roman army and Byzantine army. \n\nIt had characteristics of the
    classical Greek and Hellenistic phalanxes, but was more flexible. \n\nIt was
    used against cavalry more than infantry.\nHowever, the phalanx did not totally
    disappear. \n\nIn some battles between the Roman army and Hellenistic phalanxes,
    such as Pydna (168 BC), Cynoscephalae (197 BC) and Magnesia (190 BC), the phalanx
    performed well. \n\nIt even drove back the Roman infantry. \n\nHowever, at Cynoscephalae
    and Magnesia, failure to defend the flanks of the phalanx led to defeat. \n\nAt
    Pydna, the phalanx lost cohesion when pursuing retreating Roman soldiers. \n\nThis
    allowed the Romans to penetrate the formation. \n\nThen, Roman close combat skills
    proved decisive. \n\nThe historian Polybius details the effectiveness of the
    Roman legion against the phalanx. \n\nHe deduces that the Romans refused to fight
    the phalanx where the phalanx was effective, Romans offered battle only when
    a legion could exploit the clumsiness and immobility of a phalanx.\n\nSpear-armed
    troops continued to be important elements in many armies until reliable firearms
    became available. \n\nThese did not necessarily fight as a phalanx. \n\nFor example,
    compare the classical phalanx and late medieval pike formations.Military historians
    have suggested that the Scots under William Wallace and Robert the Bruce consciously
    imitated the Hellenistic phalanx to produce the Scots 'hedgehog' or schiltron.
    \n\nHowever, long spears might have been used by Picts and others in Scotlands'
    Early Middle Ages. \n\nPrior to 1066, long spear tactics (also found in North
    Wales) might have been part of irregular warfare in Britain. \n\nThe Scots used
    imported French pikes and dynamic tactics at the Battle of Flodden. \n\nHowever,
    Flodden found the Scots pitted against effective light artillery, while advancing
    over bad ground. \n\nThe combination disorganised the Scotts phalanxes and permitted
    effective attacks by English longbowmen, and soldiers wielding shorter, handier
    polearms called bills. \n\nSome contemporary sources might say that the bills
    cut off the heads of Scots pikes.\nThe pike was briefly reconsidered as a weapon
    by European armies in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. \n\nIt could protect
    riflemen, whose slower rate of fire made them vulnerable. \n\nA collapsible pike
    was invented but never issued. \n\nThe Confederate Army considered these for
    the American Civil War. \n\nSome were even manufactured but probably were never
    issued. \n\nPikes were manufactured during World War II as \"Croft's Pikes\".\nWhile
    obsolete in military practice, the phalanx remained in use as a metaphor of warriors
    moving forward as a single united block. \n\nThis metaphor inspired several 20th-century
    political movements, notably the Spanish Falange and its ideology of Falangism.\nThe
    Byzantines continued and improved the use of the classical Greek phalanx alongside
    the Macedonian-style phalanx. \n\nThe latter was based on a model that Alexander
    himself had created and had tried to give more importance to the skirmishers
    and cavalry, yet it never saw action until the Byzantines adopted the model that
    rely in a mixture of many units sometimes. \n\nMany writers of the age describe
    the spear as being a sarissa yet it was a meter short than the original sarissa
    and had being modified by the time, yet the term for the long spear remained
    alongside with its other names.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phalanx"

  descriptionText: "\n\nFIBULA\n\n\nThe fibula or calf bone is a leg bone on the
    lateral side of the tibia, to which it is connected above and below. \n\nIt is
    the smaller of the two bones and, in proportion to its length, the most slender
    of all the long bones. \n\nIts upper extremity is small, placed toward the back
    of the head of the tibia, below the knee joint and excluded from the formation
    of this joint. \n\nIts lower extremity inclines a little forward, so as to be
    on a plane anterior to that of the upper end; it projects below the tibia and
    forms the lateral part of the ankle joint.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe bone has
    the following components:\n\n-Lateral malleolus\n-Interosseous membrane connecting
    the fibula to the tibia, forming a syndesmosis joint\n-The superior tibiofibular
    articulation is an arthrodial joint between the lateral condyle of the tibia
    and the head of the fibula.\n-The inferior tibiofibular articulation (tibiofibular
    syndesmosis) is formed by the rough, convex surface of the medial side of the
    lower end of the fibula, and a rough concave surface on the lateral side of the
    tibia.\n\n\n=== Blood supply ===\n\nThe blood supply is important for planning
    free tissue transfer because the fibula is commonly used to reconstruct the mandible. 
    \n\nThe shaft is supplied in its middle third by a large nutrient vessel from
    the fibular artery.  \n\nIt is also perfused from its periosteum which receives
    many small branches from the fibular artery.  \n\nThe proximal head and the epiphysis
    are supplied by a branch of the anterior tibial artery.  \n\nIn harvesting the
    bone the middle third is always taken and the ends preserved (4 cm  proximally
    and 6 cm  distally)\n\n\n=== Development ===\n\nThe fibula is ossified from three
    centers, one for the shaft, and one for either end. \n\nOssification begins in
    the body about the eighth week of fetal life, and extends toward the extremities.
    At birth the ends are cartilaginous.\n\nOssification commences in the lower end
    in the second year, and in the upper about the fourth year. The lower epiphysis,
    the first to ossify, unites with the body about the twentieth year; the upper
    epiphysis joins about the twenty-fifth year.\n\n\n=== Head ===\n\nThe upper extremity
    or head of the fibula is of an irregular quadrate form, presenting above a flattened
    articular surface, directed upward, forward, and medialward, for articulation
    with a corresponding surface on the lateral condyle of the tibia. \n\nOn the
    lateral side is a thick and rough prominence continued behind into a pointed
    eminence, the apex (styloid process), which projects upward from the posterior
    part of the head.\n\nThe prominence, at its upper and lateral part, gives attachment
    to the tendon of the biceps femoris and to the fibular collateral ligament of
    the knee-joint, the ligament dividing the tendon into two parts.\n\nThe remaining
    part of the circumference of the head is rough, for the attachment of muscles
    and ligaments. \n\nIt presents in front a tubercle for the origin of the upper
    and anterior fibers of the peroneus longus, and a surface for the attachment
    of the anterior ligament of the head; and behind, another tubercle, for the attachment
    of the posterior ligament of the head and the origin of the upper fibers of the
    soleus.\n\n\n=== Body ===\n\nThe body of the fibula presents four borders - the
    antero-lateral, the antero-medial, the postero-lateral, and the postero-medial;
    and four surfaces - anterior, posterior, medial, and lateral.\n\n==Borders==\n\nThe
    antero-lateral border begins above in front of the head, runs vertically downward
    to a little below the middle of the bone, and then curving somewhat lateralward,
    bifurcates so as to embrace a triangular subcutaneous surface immediately above
    the lateral malleolus. \n\nThis border gives attachment to an intermuscular septum,
    which separates the extensor muscles on the anterior surface of the leg from
    the peronaei longus and brevis on the lateral surface.\n\nThe antero-medial border,
    or interosseous crest, is situated close to the medial side of the preceding,
    and runs nearly parallel with it in the upper third of its extent, but diverges
    from it in the lower two-thirds. \n\nIt begins above just beneath the head of
    the bone (sometimes it is quite indistinct for about 2.5 cm. below the head),
    and ends at the apex of a rough triangular surface immediately above the articular
    facet of the lateral malleolus. \n\nIt serves for the attachment of the interosseous
    membrane, which separates the extensor muscles in front from the flexor muscles
    behind.\n\nThe postero-lateral border is prominent; it begins above at the apex,
    and ends below in the posterior border of the lateral malleolus. \n\nIt is directed
    lateralward above, backward in the middle of its course, backward, and a little
    medialward below, and gives attachment to an aponeurosis which separates the
    peronaei on the lateral surface from the flexor muscles on the posterior surface.\n\nThe
    postero-medial border, sometimes called the oblique line, begins above at the
    medial side of the head, and ends by becoming continuous with the interosseous
    crest at the lower fourth of the bone. \n\nIt is well-marked and prominent at
    the upper and middle parts of the bone. \n\nIt gives attachment to an aponeurosis
    which separates the tibialis posterior from the soleus and flexor hallucis longus.\n\n===Surfaces===\n\nThe
    anterior surface is the interval between the antero-lateral and antero-medial
    borders. \n\nIt is extremely narrow and flat in the upper third of its extent;
    broader and grooved longitudinally in its lower third; it serves for the origin
    of three muscles: the extensor digitorum longus, extensor hallucis longus, and
    peroneus tertius.\n\nThe posterior surface is the space included between the
    postero-lateral and the postero-medial borders; it is continuous below with the
    triangular area above the articular surface of the lateral malleolus; it is directed
    backward above, backward and medialward at its middle, directly medialward below.
    \n\nIts upper third is rough, for the origin of the soleus; its lower part presents
    a triangular surface, connected to the tibia by a strong interosseous ligament;
    the intervening part of the surface is covered by the fibers of origin of the
    flexor hallucis longus. \n\nNear the middle of this surface is the nutrient foramen,
    which is directed downward.\n\nThe medial surface is the interval included between
    the antero-medial and the postero-medial borders. \n\nIt is grooved for the origin
    of the tibialis posterior.\n\nThe lateral surface is the space between the antero-lateral
    and postero-lateral borders. \n\nIt is broad, and often deeply grooved; it is
    directed lateralward in the upper two-thirds of its course, backward in the lower
    third, where it is continuous with the posterior border of the lateral malleolus.
    \n\nThis surface gives origin to the peronaei longus and brevis.\n\n== Function
    ==\n\nThe fibula does not carry any significant load (weight) of the body. \n\nIt
    extends past the lower end of the tibia and forms the outer part of the ankle
    providing stability to this joint. \n\nIt has grooves for certain ligaments which
    gives them leverage and multiplies the muscle force. \n\nIt provides attachment
    points for the following muscles:\n\n\n== Clinical significance ==\n\n\n=== Fractures
    ===\n\nThe most common type of fibula fracture is located at the distal end of
    the bone, and is classified as ankle fracture. In the Danis\u2013Weber classification
    it has three categories:\n\n-Type A: Fracture of the lateral malleolus, distal
    to the syndesmosis (the connection between the distal ends of the tibia and fibula).\n-Type
    B: Fracture of the fibula at the level of the syndesmosis\n-Type C: Fracture
    of the fibula proximal to the syndesmosis.\n\nA Maisonneuve fracture is a spiral
    fracture of the proximal third of the fibula associated with a tear of the distal
    tibiofibular syndesmosis and the interosseous membrane. There is an associated
    fracture of the medial malleolus or rupture of the deep deltoid ligament.\n\nAn
    avulsion fracture of the head of the fibula refers to the fracture of the fibular
    head because of a sudden contraction of the biceps femoris muscle that pulls
    its site of attachment on the bone. \n\nThe attachment of the biceps femoris
    tendon on the fibular head is closely related to the lateral collateral ligament
    of the knee. \n\nTherefore, this ligament is prone to injury in this type of
    avulsion fracture.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Etymology ===\n\nThe word fibula
    can be dated back to c. 1670 to describe a clasp or brooch \u2013 see fibula
    (brooch) \u2013 and was first used in English for the smaller bone in the lower
    leg c. 1706. It derives from Latin f\u012Bbula, also meaning a clasp or brooch.
    \n\nThe bone was so called because it resembles a clasp like a modern safety
    pin.The adjective peroneal referring to the fibula bone or its surrounding structures
    derives from \u03C0\u03B5\u03C1\u03CC\u03BD\u03B7 : per\xF3n\u0113, the Ancient
    Greek word for a clasp.\n\n\n== Other animals ==\n\nBecause the fibula bears
    relatively little weight in comparison with the tibia, it is typically narrower
    in all but the most primitive tetrapods. \n\nIn many animals, it still articulates
    with the posterior part of the lower extremity of the femur, but this feature
    is frequently lost (as it is in humans). \n\nIn some animals, the reduction of
    the fibula has proceeded even further than it has in humans, with the loss of
    the tarsal articulation, and, in extreme cases (such as the horse), partial fusion
    with the tibia.\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibula"

  descriptionText: "\n\nPREMOLAR\n\n\nThe premolars, also called premolar teeth,
    or bicuspids, are transitional teeth located between the canine and molar teeth.
    \n\nIn humans, there are two premolars per quadrant in the permanent set of teeth,
    making eight premolars total in the mouth. \n\nThey have at least two cusps.
    \n\nPremolars can be considered transitional teeth during chewing, or mastication.
    \n\nThey have properties of both the canines, that lay anterior and molars that
    lay posterior, and so food can be transferred from the canines to the premolars
    and finally to the molars for grinding, instead of directly from the canines
    to the molars.\n\n\n== Human anatomy ==\n\nThe premolars in humans are the maxillary
    first premolar, maxillary second premolar, mandibular first premolar, and the
    mandibular second premolar. \n\nPremolar teeth by definition are permanent teeth
    distal to the canines, preceded by deciduous molars.\n\n\n=== Morphology ===\n\nThere
    is always one large buccal cusp, especially so in the mandibular first premolar.
    \n\nThe lower second premolar almost always presents with two lingual cusps.The
    lower premolars and the upper second premolar usually have one root. \n\nThe
    upper first usually has two roots, but can have just one root, notably in Sinodonts,
    and can sometimes have three roots.Premolars are unique to the permanent dentition.
    \n\nPremolars are referred to as bicuspid (has two main cusps), a buccal and
    a palatal/lingual cusp which are separated by a mesiodistal occlusal fissure.\nThe
    maxillary premolars are trapezoidal in shape. \n\nWhilst the mandibular premolars
    are rhomboidal in shape.\n\n\n==== Maxillary first premolar ====\nThe crown of
    the tooth appears ovoid, wider buccally than palatally\nFrom a buccal view, the
    first premolar is similar to the adjacent canine\nRoots: Two roots buccal and
    palatal. \n\nSometimes (40%) there is only one root.\n\n\n==== Maxillary second
    premolar ====\nSimilar to maxillary first premolar but the mesio-buccal and disto-buccal
    corners are rounder\nThe two cusps are smaller and more equal in size\nShorter
    occlusal fissure\nUsually one root\n\n\n==== Mandibular first premolar ====\n\n-The
    smallest premolar out of all four\n-Dominant buccal cusp and a very small lingual
    cusp\n-The buccal cusp is broad and the lingual cusp is less than half the size
    of the buccal cusp.\n-Two-thirds of the buccal surface can be seen from the occlusal
    aspect\n-A single conical root with an oval/round cross section. \n-The root
    is grooved longitudinally both mesially and distally.\n\n\n==== Mandibular second
    premolar ====\n\nThe crown is larger than the mandibular first premolar\nLingual
    cusp is smaller than the buccal cusp but better developed.\n\nThe lingual and
    buccal cusp is separated by a well defined mesiodistal occlusal fissure\n\nThe
    lingual cusp is divided into two; the mesiolingual and distolingual cusps with
    the mesiolingual cusp being higher and wider than the distolingual.\n\nRoot:
    Single conical root, oval/round in cross section.\n\n\n== Orthodontics ==\n\nThe
    four first premolars are the most commonly removed teeth, in 48.8% of cases,
    when teeth are removed for orthodontic treatment (which is in 45.8% of orthodontic
    patients). \n\nThe removal of only the maxillary first premolars is the second
    likeliest option, in 14.5% of cases.\n\n\n== Other mammals ==\n\nIn primitive
    placental mammals there are four premolars per quadrant, but the most mesial
    two (closer to the front of the mouth) have been lost in catarrhines (Old World
    monkeys and apes, including humans). \n\nPaleontologists therefore refer to human
    premolars as Pm3 and Pm4.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premolar"

  descriptionText: "\n\nETHMOID BONE\n\n\nThe ethmoid bone (from Greek ethmos, \"sieve\")
    is an unpaired bone in the skull that separates the nasal cavity from the brain.
    \n\nIt is located at the roof of the nose, between the two orbits. \n\nThe cubical
    bone is lightweight due to a spongy construction. \n\nThe ethmoid bone is one
    of the bones that make up the orbit of the eye.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe ethmoid
    bone is an anterior cranial bone located between the eyes. \n\nIt contributes
    to the medial wall of the orbit, the nasal cavity, and the nasal septum. \n\nThe
    ethmoid has three parts: cribriform plate, ethmoidal labyrinth, and perpendicular
    plate. \n\nThe cribriform plate forms the roof of the nasal cavity and also contributes
    to formation of the anterior cranial fossa, the ethmoidal labyrinth consists
    of a large mass on either side of the perpendicular plate, and the perpendicular
    plate forms the superior two-thirds of the nasal septum. \n\nBetween the orbital
    plate and the nasal conchae are the ethmoidal sinuses or ethmoidal air cells,
    which are a variable number of small cavities in the lateral mass of the ethmoid.\n\n\n===
    Articulations ===\n\nThe ethmoid articulates with thirteen bones:\n\ntwo bones
    of the neurocranium\u2014the frontal, and the sphenoid (at the sphenoidal body
    and at the sphenoidal conchae).\neleven bones of the viscerocranium\u2014, two
    nasal bones, two maxillae, two lacrimals, two palatines, two inferior nasal conchae,
    and the vomer.\n\n\n=== Development ===\n\nThe ethmoid is ossified in the cartilage
    of the nasal capsule by three centers: one for the perpendicular plate, and one
    for each labyrinth.\nThe labyrinths are first developed, ossific granules making
    their appearance in the region of the lamina papyracea between the fourth and
    fifth months of fetal life, and extending into the conch\xE6.\nAt birth, the
    bone consists of the two labyrinths, which are small and ill-developed. \n\nDuring
    the first year after birth, the perpendicular plate and crista galli begin to
    ossify from a single center, and are joined to the labyrinths about the beginning
    of the second year.\nThe cribriform plate is ossified partly from the perpendicular
    plate and partly from the labyrinths.\nThe development of the ethmoidal cells
    begins during fetal life.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\n=== Role in magnetoception ===\n\n\nSome
    birds and other migratory animals have deposits of biological magnetite in their
    ethmoid bones which allow them to sense the direction of the Earth's magnetic
    field. \n\nHumans have a similar magnetite deposit (ferric iron), but it is believed
    to be vestigial.\n\n\n== Clinical significance ==\n\nFracture of the lamina papyracea,
    the lateral plate of the ethmoid labyrinth bone, permits communication between
    the nasal cavity and the orbit on the same side of the body through the inferomedial
    orbital wall, resulting in orbital emphysema. \n\nIncreased pressure within the
    nasal cavity, as seen during sneezing, for example, leads to temporary exophthalmos.\nThe
    porous fragile nature of the ethmoid bone makes it particularly susceptible to
    fractures. \n\nThe ethmoid is usually fractured from an upward force to the nose.
    \n\nThis could occur by hitting the dashboard in a car crash or landing on the
    ground after a fall. \n\nThe ethmoid fracture can produce bone fragments that
    penetrate the cribriform plate. \n\nThis trauma can lead to a leak of cerebrospinal
    fluid into the nasal cavity. \n\nThese openings let opportunistic bacteria in
    the nasal cavity enter the sterile environment of the central nervous system
    (CNS). \n\nThe CNS is usually protected by the blood-brain barrier, but holes
    in the cribriform plate let bacteria get through the barrier. \n\nThe blood-brain
    barrier makes it extremely difficult to treat such infections, because only certain
    drugs can cross into the CNS.\nAn ethmoid fracture can also sever the olfactory
    nerve. \n\nThis injury results in anosmia (loss of smell). \n\nA reduction in
    the ability to taste is also a side effect because it is based so heavily on
    smell. \n\nThis injury is not fatal, but can be dangerous, as when a person fails
    to smell smoke, gas, or spoiled food. \n\nIn fact, people with anosmia were more
    than four times as likely to die in five years compared to those with a healthy
    sense of smell.\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethmoid_bone"

    XIPHOID PROCESS



    Located at the inferior end of
    the sternum is the pointed xiphoid process.


    Improperly performed chest
    compressions during cardiopulmonary resuscitation can cause the xiphoid process
    to snap off, driving it into the liver which can cause a fatal hemorrhage.


    The
    sternum is composed of highly vascular tissue, covered by a thin layer of compact
    bone which is thickest in the manubrium between the articular facets for the
    clavicles.


    The inferior sternopericardial ligament attaches the pericardium
    to the posterior xiphoid process.

  descriptionText: "\n\nFOURTH RIB\n\n\n== Structure of the rib cage ==\n\nRibs are
    described based on their location and connection with the sternum. \n\nAll ribs
    are attached posteriorly to the thoracic vertebrae and are numbered accordingly
    one to twelve. \n\nRibs that articulate directly with the sternum are called
    true ribs, whereas those that do not articulate directly are termed false ribs.
    \n\n\n=== Attachment of the rib cage ===\n\nThe terms true ribs and false ribs
    describe rib pairs that are directly or indirectly attached to the sternum. \n\nThe
    first seven rib pairs known as the fixed or vertebrosternal ribs are the true
    ribs (Latin: costae verae) as they connect directly to the sternum; the next
    five pairs (eighth to twelfth) are the false ribs (Latin: costae spuriae). \n\n\n===
    Parts of rib (general) ===\n\nEach rib consists of a head, neck, and a shaft.
    \n\nAll ribs are attached posteriorly to the thoracic vertebrae. \n\nThey are
    numbered to match the vertebrae they attach to \u2013 one to twelve, from top
    (T1) to bottom. \n\nThe head of the rib is the end part closest to the vertebra
    with which it articulates. \n\nIt is marked by a kidney-shaped articular surface
    which is divided by a horizontal crest into two articulating regions. \n\nThe
    upper region articulates with the inferior costal facet on the vertebra above,
    and the larger region articulates with the superior costal facet on the vertebra
    with the same number. \n\nThe transverse process of a thoracic vertebra also
    articulates at the transverse costal facet with the tubercle of the rib of the
    same number. \n\nThe crest gives attachment to the intra-articular ligament.The
    neck of the rib is the flattened part that extends laterally from the head. \n\nThe
    neck is about 3 cm long. \n\nIts anterior surface is flat and smooth, whilst
    its posterior is perforated by numerous foramina and its surface rough, to give
    attachment to the ligament of the neck. \n\nIts upper border presents a rough
    crest (crista colli costae) for the attachment of the anterior costotransverse
    ligament; its lower border is rounded.\n\nOn the posterior surface at the neck,
    is an eminence\u2014the tubercle that consists of an articular and a non-articular
    portion. \n\nThe articular portion is the lower and more medial of the two and
    presents a small, oval surface for articulation with the transverse costal facet
    on the end of the transverse process of the lower of the two vertebrae to which
    the head is connected. \n\nThe non-articular portion is a rough elevation and
    affords attachment to the ligament of the tubercle. \n\nThe tubercle is much
    more prominent in the upper ribs than in the lower ribs.\n\nThe angle of a rib
    (costal angle) may both refer to the bending part of it, and a prominent line
    in this area, a little in front of the tubercle. \n\nThis line is directed downward
    and laterally; this gives attachment to a tendon of the iliocostalis muscle.
    \n\nAt this point, the rib is bent in two directions, and at the same time twisted
    on its long axis.\n\nThe distance between the angle and the tubercle is progressively
    greater from the second to the tenth ribs. \n\nThe area between the angle and
    the tubercle is rounded, rough, and irregular, and serves for the attachment
    of the longissimus dorsi muscle.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rib_cage"

    the front teeth present in most mammals. \n\nThey are located in the premaxilla
    above and on the mandible below. \n\nHumans have a total of eight (two on each
    side, top and bottom). \n\nOpossums have 18, whereas armadillos have none.\n\n\n==
    Structure ==\n\nAdult humans normally have eight incisors, two of each type.
    \n\nThe types of incisor are:\n\nmaxillary central incisor (upper jaw, closest
    to the center of the lips)\nmaxillary lateral incisor (upper jaw, beside the
    maxillary central incisor)\nmandibular central incisor (lower jaw, closest to
    the center of the lips)\nmandibular lateral incisor (lower jaw, beside the mandibular
    central incisor)Children with a full set of deciduous teeth (primary teeth) also
    have eight incisors, named the same way as in permanent teeth. \n\nYoung children
    may have from zero to eight incisors depending on the stage of their tooth eruption
    and tooth development. \n\nTypically, the mandibular central incisors erupt first,
    followed by the maxillary central incisors, the mandibular lateral incisors and
    finally the maxillary laterals. \n\nThe rest of the primary dentition erupts
    after the incisors.Apart from the first molars, the incisors are also the first
    permanent teeth to erupt, following the same order as the primary teeth, among
    themselves.\n\n\n=== Other animals ===\n\nAmong other animals, the number varies
    from species to species. \n\nOpossums have 18, whereas armadillos have none.
    \n\nCats, dogs, foxes, pigs, and horses have twelve. \n\nRodents have four. \n\nRabbits
    and hares (lagomorphs) were once considered rodents, but are distinguished by
    having six\u2014one small pair, called \"peg teeth\", is located directly behind
    the most anterior pair. \n\nIncisors are used to bite off tough foods, such as
    red meat.\nCattle (cows, bulls, etc.) have none on top but a total of six on
    the bottom.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\nIn cats, the incisors are small; biting off
    meat is done with the canines and the carnassials. \n\nIn elephants, the upper
    incisors are modified into curved tusks (unlike with Narwhals, where it is a
    canine that develops into a straight and twisted tusk). \n\nThe incisors of rodents
    grow throughout life and are worn by gnawing. \n\nIn humans, the incisors serve
    to cut off pieces of food, as well as in the grip of other food items.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incisor"

  descriptionText: "\n\nINCUS\n\n\nThe incus or anvil is a bone in the middle ear.
    \n\nThe anvil-shaped small bone is one of three ossicles in the middle ear. \n\nThe
    incus receives vibrations from the malleus, to which it is connected laterally,
    and transmits these to the stapes medially. \n\nThe incus is so-called because
    of its resemblance to an anvil (Latin: Incus).\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\n\nThe
    incus is the second of the ossicles, three bones in the middle ear which act
    to transmit sound. \n\nIt is shaped like an anvil, and has a long and short crus
    extending from the body, which articulates with the malleus.:\u200A862\u200A
    The short crus attaches to the posterior ligament of the incus. \n\nThe long
    crus articulates with the stirrup at the lenticular process.\nThe superior ligament
    of the incus attaches at the body of the incus to the roof of the tympanic cavity.\n\n\n==
    Function ==\n\n\nVibrations in the middle ear are received via the tympanic membrane.
    \n\nThe malleus, resting on the membrane, conveys vibrations to the incus. \n\nThis
    in turn conveys vibrations to the stapes.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\"Incus\" means
    \"anvil\" in Latin. \n\nSeveral sources attribute the discovery of the incus
    to the anatomist and philosopher Alessandro Achillini. \n\nThe first brief written
    description of the incus was by Berengario da Carpi in his Commentaria super
    anatomia Mundini (1521). \n\nAndreas Vesalius, in his De humani corporis fabrica,
    was the first to compare the second element of the ossicles to an anvil, thereby
    giving it the name incus. \n\nThe final part of the long limb was once described
    as a \"fourth ossicle\" by Pieter Paaw in 1615.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incus"

  descriptionText: "\n\nLUNATE BONE\n\n\nThe lunate bone (semilunar bone) is a carpal
    bone in the human hand. \n\nIt is distinguished by its deep concavity and crescentic
    outline. \n\nIt is situated in the center of the proximal row carpal bones, which
    lie between the ulna and radius and the hand. \n\nThe lunate carpal bone is situated
    between the lateral scaphoid bone and medial triquetral bone.\n\n\n== Structure
    ==\n\nThe lunate is a crescent-shaped carpal bone found within the hand. \n\nThe
    lunate is found within the proximal row of carpal bones. \n\nProximally, it abuts
    the radius. \n\nLaterally, it articulates with the scaphoid, medially with the
    triquetral, and distally with the capitate. \n\nThe lunate also articulates on
    its distal and medial surface with the hamate bone.:\u200A708\u200AThe lunate
    is stabilised by a medial ligament to the scaphoid and a lateral ligament to
    the triquetrum. \n\nLigaments between the radius and carpal bone also stabilise
    the position of the lunate, as does its position in the lunate fossa of the radius.\n\n\n===
    Bone ===\n\nThe proximal surface of the lunate bone is smooth and convex, articulating
    with the radius. \n\nThe lateral surface is flat and narrow, with a crescentic
    facet for articulation with the scaphoid. \n\nThe medial surface possesses a
    smooth and quadrilateral facet for articulation with the triquetral. \n\nThe
    palmar surface is rough, as is the dorsal surface. \n\nThe dorsal surface is
    broad and rounded. \n\nThe distal surface of the bone is deep and concave.\n\n\n===
    Blood supply ===\n\nThe lunate receives its blood supply from dorsal and palmar
    branches.\n\n\n=== Variation ===\n\nThe lunate has a variable shape. \n\nAbout
    one-third of lunate bones do not possess a medial facet, meaning they do not
    articulate with the hamate bone. \n\nAdditionally, in about 20% of people, blood
    supply may arise from palmar vessels alone.\n\n\n=== Ossification ===\n\nThe
    ossification of the lunate bone commences between 18 months and 4 years and 3
    months.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\nThe carpal bones function as a unit to provide
    a bony superstructure for the hand.:\u200A708\u200A As a proximal carpal bone,
    the lunate is also involved in movement of the wrist.\n\n\n== Clinical relevance
    ==\n\n\nThe lunate bone is the most frequently dislocated carpal bone. \n\nCarpal
    coalition\nKienbock's disease\nTeisen classification\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe
    name of the lunate bone derives from the \"crescent-shaped\" (Latin: lunatus),
    from Latin luna (\"moon\"), from the bone's resemblance to a crescent moon. \n\nIn
    amphibians and reptiles, the bone is instead referred to as the intermedium,
    because of its position between the other two proximal carpals.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunate_bone"

  descriptionText: "\n\nTHYROID CARTILAGE\n\n\nThe thyroid cartilage is the largest
    of the nine cartilages that make up the laryngeal skeleton, the cartilage structure
    in and around the trachea that contains the larynx. \n\nIt does not completely
    encircle the larynx (only the cricoid cartilage encircles it).\n\n\n== Structure
    ==\n\nThe thyroid cartilage is a hyaline cartilage structure that sits in front
    of the larynx and above the thyroid gland. \n\nThe cartilage is composed of two
    halves, which meet in the middle at a peak called the laryngeal prominence, also
    called the Adam's apple. \n\nIn the midline above the prominence is the superior
    thyroid notch. \n\nA counterpart notch at the bottom of the cartilage is called
    the inferior thyroid notch.\n\nThe two halves of the cartilage that make out
    the outer surfaces extend obliquely to cover the sides of the trachea. \n\nThe
    posterior edge of each half articulates with the cricoid cartilage inferiorly
    at a joint called the cricothyroid joint. \n\nThe most posterior part of the
    cartilage also has two projections upwards and downwards. \n\nThe upper projection
    is called the superior horn (cornu), and the lower is called the inferior horn.
    \n\nThe superior horn is long and narrow, backward, and medialward, and ends
    in a conical extremity, which gives attachment to the lateral thyrohyoid ligament.
    \n\nThe inferior horn is short and thick; it is directed downward, with a slight
    inclination forward and medialward, and presents, on the medial side of its tip,
    a small oval articular facet for articulation with the side of the cricoid cartilage.\n\nThe
    entire superior edge of the thyroid cartilage is attached to the hyoid bone by
    the thyrohyoid membrane. \n\nThe thyroid cartilage is found between the levels
    of the C4 to C5 vertebrae.\nThe oblique line is a line on the thyroid cartilage.
    \n\nIt marks the upper lateral borders of the thyroid gland. \n\nTwo muscles
    originate along the line, the thyrohyoid muscle and inferior pharyngeal constrictor.
    \n\nThe sternothyroid inserts along the line.\n\nMovement of the cartilage at
    this joint produces a change in tension at the vocal folds, which in turn produces
    variation in voice.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\nThe thyroid cartilage forms the bulk
    of the front wall of the larynx. \n\nIt protects the vocal folds (\"vocal cords\"),
    which are located directly behind it.\n\nWhen the angle of the thyroid cartilage
    changes relative to the cricoid cartilage, this changes the pitch of voice.\n\nThe
    cartilage also serves as an attachment for several muscles.\n\n\n== Etymology
    ==\n\n\n\n=== Shield-like ===\n\nThe English term thyroid cartilage is derived
    from the Latin expression cartilago thyreoides. \n\nThe latter is a translation
    of Ancient Greek \u03C7\u03CC\u03BD\u03B4\u03C1\u03BF\u03C2 \u03B8\u03C5\u03C1\u03B5\u03BF\u03B5\u03B9\u03B4\u03AE\u03C2,
    attested in the writings of the Greek physician Galen. \n\nThe Latin word cartilago,
    as well as the Ancient Greek word \u03C7\u03CC\u03BD\u03B4\u03C1\u03BF\u03C2,
    both mean cartilage, while the ancient Greek word \u03B8\u03C5\u03C1\u03B5\u03BF\u03B5\u03B9\u03B4\u03AE\u03C2
    means shield-like or shield-shaped. \n\nThe latter compound is composed of Ancient
    Greek \u03B8\u03C5\u03C1\u03B5\u03CC\u03C2, shield and \u03B5\u1F36\u03B4\u03BF\u03C2,
    form/shape. \n\nThe Greeks used \u03B5\u1F36\u03B4\u03BF\u03C2 in compounds to
    indicate a resemblance with the first part of the word.The ancient Greek word
    \u03B8\u03C5\u03C1\u03B5\u03CC\u03C2 can be found in the Odyssey of Homer, and
    represented a large square stone that was put against the door to keep it shut.
    \n\nThose \u03B8\u03C5\u03C1\u03B5\u03BF\u03AF were eventually used by the Greek
    army as shields to protect themselves. \n\nThis shield was adapted by Roman legions
    and referred to by them as a scutum. \n\nThe Roman scutum was an oblong shield
    with an oval shape. \n\nNumerous shields were used by the Roman soldiers, such
    as the pelta, parma and clypeus. \n\nIn contrast to the scutum, these shields
    were round. \n\nDespite these latter shields bearing a clear round shape, coinages
    like petalis cartilago, cartilago parmalis, and cartilago clypealis were coined
    for the thyroid cartilage. \n\nIn 16th-century Italian anatomist Realdo Colombo's
    De re anatomica, besides the aforementioned incorrect petalis cartilago, correct
    forms like scutalis cartilago and scutiformis cartilago can be found, as the
    scutum is the real Roman pendant of the Greek \u03B8\u03C5\u03C1\u03B5\u03CC\u03C2.
    \n\nThe latter Latin expression can be found in its English form in medical dictionaries
    as scutiform cartilage, while the name of the shield itself, i.e. scutum, is
    still being mentioned as a synonym for the thyroid cartilage.\n\n\n=== Spelling
    ===\n\nIn the various editions of the official Latin nomenclature (Nomina Anatomica,
    in 1998 rebaptized as Terminologia Anatomica), three different spellings can
    be found, i.e. cartilago thyreoidea. cartilago thyroidea and the previously mentioned
    cartilago thyreoides. \n\nThe variant with the adjective thyreoidea (with the
    ending -ea) would be a faulty rendering of Ancient Greek \u03B8\u03C5\u03C1\u03B5\u03BF\u03B5\u03B9\u03B4\u03AE\u03C2
    in Latin. \n\nGreek compounds ending in -\u03B5\u03B9\u03B4\u03AE\u03C2, when
    imported into Latin as a loanword, ended in -ides. \n\nIn the 17th-century the
    non-classical Latin form -ideus/-idea/ideum for Greek -\u03B5\u03B9\u03B4\u03AE\u03C2/-\u03B5\u03B9\u03B4\u03AD\u03C2
    came into use, mostly by French anatomist Jean Riolan the Younger. \n\nNo Greek
    loanwords (originally -\u03B5\u03B9\u03B4\u03AE\u03C2/-\u03B5\u03B9\u03B4\u03AD\u03C2)
    ending in -ideus/-idea/-ideum exist in classical Latin, thereby making the -ideus/-idea/-ideum
    form non-Latinate in character. \n\nThe first edition of the Jena Nomina Anatomica
    (JNA) contained the incorrect cartilago thyreoidea, but after a list of recommendations/corrections
    was made this was corrected in subsequent editions of the JNA.\n\nThe variant
    with thyroidea (omitting e after thyr) is a compromise for English-speaking anatomists,
    as they have difficulties pronouncing that specific combination of letters, forcing
    a greater resemblance between Latin and English orthography. \n\nDorland's medical
    dictionary from 1948 already adopted this incorrect spelling with an erroneous
    reference to the official Basle Nomina Anatomica even before the nomenclature
    committee of the Nomina Anatomica officially approved this orthographic revision
    in its edition of 1961. \n\nThe spelling without an e is commonly accepted in
    English but earlier works preferred the etymologically correct thyreoid cartilage.
    \n\nThe official Latin veterinary nomenclature, Nomina Anatomica Veterinaria
    has the form cartilago thyroidea, in common with the human Nomina Anatomica/Terminologia
    Anatomica, but allows (in contrast to the latter) cartilago thyreoidea as an
    alternative spelling.\n\n\n=== Shield versus door ===\n\nAn unfortunate mishap
    is the resemblance between Latin thyroidea and English thyroid on the one side
    and Ancient Greek \u03B8\u03C5\u03C1\u03BF\u03B5\u03B9\u03B4\u03AE\u03C2 on the
    other side, as the latter does not mean shield-like, but actually means like
    a door, derived from \u03B8\u03CD\u03C1\u03B1, door. \n\n\u0398\u03C5\u03C1\u03BF\u03B5\u03B9\u03B4\u03AE\u03C2
    is however used in anatomic nomenclature in the expression \u03B8\u03C5\u03C1\u03BF\u03B5\u03B9\u03B4\u03AD\u03C2
    \u03C4\u03C1\u1FC6\u03BC\u03B1 (\u03C4\u03C1\u1FC6\u03BC\u03B1 = hole, perforation,
    aperture), coined by the Greek physician Galen. \n\nAncient Greek \u03B8\u03CD\u03C1\u03B1
    can be translated, besides the aforementioned door, as gate, entrance and opening.
    \n\nThe Greek name \u03B8\u03C5\u03C1\u03BF\u03B5\u03B9\u03B4\u03AD\u03C2 \u03C4\u03C1\u1FC6\u03BC\u03B1
    for this opening between the os pubis and the os ischii, currently called obturator
    foramen, clearly originates from its being an opening (\u03B8\u03CD\u03C1\u03B1),
    while bearing no resemblance to a shield (\u03B8\u03C5\u03C1\u03B5\u03CC\u03C2).
    \n\nThe Latin translation foramen thyreoideum for \u03B8\u03C5\u03C1\u03BF\u03B5\u03B9\u03B4\u03AD\u03C2
    \u03C4\u03C1\u1FC6\u03BC\u03B1 by the 18th\u201319th-century German physician
    and anatomist Samuel Thomas von S\xF6mmerring is clearly mistaken. \n\nThe current
    foramen thyroideum of the Terminologia Anatomica is not a Latin translation of
    Galen's \u03B8\u03C5\u03C1\u03BF\u03B5\u03B9\u03B4\u03AD\u03C2 \u03C4\u03C1\u1FC6\u03BC\u03B1,
    but an orthographic revision of what was previously known in the Nomina Anatomica
    as foramen thyreoideum, an inconstantly present opening in the lamina of the
    thyroid cartilage.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid_cartilage"

  descriptionText: "\n\nPHALANX\n\n\nThe phalanx (Ancient Greek: \u03C6\u03AC\u03BB\u03B1\u03B3\u03BE;
    plural phalanxes or phalanges, \u03C6\u03AC\u03BB\u03B1\u03B3\u03B3\u03B5\u03C2,
    phalanges) was a rectangular mass military formation, usually composed entirely
    of heavy infantry armed with spears, pikes, sarissas, or similar pole weapons.
    \n\nThe term is particularly used to describe the use of this formation in Ancient
    Greek warfare, although the ancient Greek writers used it to also describe any
    massed infantry formation, regardless of its equipment. \n\nArrian uses the term
    in his Array against the Alans when he refers to his legions. \n\nIn Greek texts,
    the phalanx may be deployed for battle, on the march, or even camped, thus describing
    the mass of infantry or cavalry that would deploy in line during battle. \n\nThey
    marched forward as one entity. \nThe term itself, as used today, does not refer
    to a distinctive military unit or division (e.g., the Roman legion or the contemporary
    Western-type battalion), but to the type of formation of an army's troops. \n\nTherefore,
    this term does not indicate a standard combat strength or composition but includes
    the total number of infantry, which is deployed in a single formation known as
    a \"phalanx\".\nMany spear-armed troops historically fought in what might be
    termed phalanx-like formations. \n\nThis article focuses on the use of the military
    phalanx formation in Ancient Greece, the Hellenistic world, and other ancient
    states heavily influenced by Greek civilization.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe earliest
    known depiction of a phalanx-like formation occurs in a Sumerian stele from the
    25th century BC. \n\nHere the troops seem to have been equipped with spears,
    helmets, and large shields covering the whole body. \n\nAncient Egyptian infantry
    were known to have employed similar formations. \n\nThe first usage of the term
    phalanx comes from Homer's \"\u03C6\u03B1\u03BB\u03B1\u03B3\u03BE\", used to
    describe hoplites fighting in an organized battle line. \n\nHomer used the term
    to differentiate the formation-based combat from the individual duels so often
    found in his poems.Historians have not arrived at a consensus about the relationship
    between the Greek formation and these predecessors of the hoplites. \n\nThe principles
    of shield wall and spear hedge were almost universally known among the armies
    of major civilizations throughout history, and so the similarities may be related
    to convergent evolution instead of diffusion.\nTraditionally, historians date
    the origin of the hoplite phalanx of ancient Greece to the 8th century BC in
    Sparta, but this is under revision. \n\nIt is perhaps more likely that the formation
    was devised in the 7th century BC after the introduction of the aspis by the
    city of Argos, which would have made the formation possible. \n\nThis is further
    evidenced by the Chigi vase, dated to 650 BC, identifying hoplites armed with
    aspis, spear and panoply.Another possible theory as to the birth of Greek phalanx
    warfare stems from the idea that some of the basic aspects of the phalanx were
    present in earlier times yet were not fully developed due to the lack of appropriate
    technology. \n\nTwo of the basic tactics seen in earlier warfare include the
    principle of cohesion and the use of large groups of soldiers. \n\nThis would
    suggest that the Greek phalanx was rather the culmination and perfection of a
    slowly developed idea that originated many years earlier. \n\nAs weaponry and
    armour advanced through the years in different city-states, the phalanx became
    complex and effective.\n\n\n== Overview ==\n\nThe hoplite phalanx of the Archaic
    and Classical periods in Greece (c. 800\u2013350 BC) was the formation in which
    the hoplites would line up in ranks in close order. \n\nThe hoplites would lock
    their shields together, and the first few ranks of soldiers would project their
    spears out over the first rank of shields. \n\nThe phalanx therefore presented
    a shield wall and a mass of spear points to the enemy, making frontal assaults
    against it very difficult. \n\nIt also allowed a higher proportion of the soldiers
    to be actively engaged in combat at a given time (rather than just those in the
    front rank).\nBattles between two phalanxes usually took place in open, flat
    plains where it was easier to advance and stay in formation. \n\nRough terrain
    or hilly regions would have made it difficult to maintain a steady line and would
    have defeated the purpose of a phalanx. \n\nAs a result, battles between Greek
    city-states would not take place in just any location, nor would they be limited
    to sometimes obvious strategic points. \n\nRather, many times, the two opposing
    sides would find the most suitable piece of land where the conflict could be
    settled. \n\nTypically, the battle ended with one of the two fighting forces
    fleeing to safety.The phalanx usually advanced at a walking pace, although it
    is possible that they picked up speed during the last several yards. \n\nOne
    of the main reasons for this slow approach was to maintain formation. \n\nThe
    formation would be rendered useless if the phalanx was lost as the unit approached
    the enemy and could even become detrimental to the advancing unit, resulting
    in a weaker formation that was easier for an enemy force to break through. \n\nIf
    the hoplites of the phalanx were to pick up speed toward the latter part of the
    advance, it would have been for the purpose of gaining momentum against the enemy
    in the initial collision. \n\nHerodotus states of the Greeks at the Battle of
    Marathon, that \"They were the first Greeks we know of to charge their enemy
    at a run\". \n\nMany historians believe that this innovation was precipitated
    by their desire to minimize their losses from Persian archery. \n\nThe opposing
    sides would collide, possibly severing many of the spears of the row in front
    and killing the front part of the enemy army due to the bone-breaking collision.\nThe
    spears of a phalanx had spiked butts. \n\nIn battle, the back ranks used the
    spikes to finish fallen enemy soldiers.\n\n\n=== Pushing ===\n\nThe \"physical
    pushing match\" theory is one where the battle would rely on the valour of the
    men in the front line, whilst those in the rear maintained forward pressure on
    the front ranks with their shields, and the whole formation would consistently
    press forward trying to break the enemy formation. \n\nThis is the most widely
    accepted interpretation of the ancient sources thus when two phalanx formations
    engaged, the struggle essentially became a pushing match. \n\nHistorians such
    as Victor Davis Hanson point out that it is difficult to account for exceptionally
    deep phalanx formations unless they were necessary to facilitate the physical
    pushing depicted by this theory, as those behind the first two ranks could not
    take part in the actual spear thrusting.No Greek art ever depicts anything like
    a phalanx pushing match, so this hypothesis is a product of educated speculation
    rather than explicit testimony from contemporary sources and is far from being
    academically resolved. \n\nThe Greek term for \"push\" was used in the same metaphorical
    manner as the English word is (for example it was also used to describe the process
    of rhetorical arguments) and so does not necessarily describe a literal physical
    push, although it is possible that it did.\nFor instance, if Othismos were to
    accurately describe a physical pushing match, it would be logical to state that
    the deeper phalanx would always win an engagement since the physical strength
    of individuals would not compensate for even one additional rank on the enemy
    side. \n\nHowever, there are numerous examples of shallow phalanxes holding off
    an opponent. \n\nFor instance, at Delium in 424 BC, the Athenian left flank,
    a formation eight men deep, held off a formation of Thebans 25 deep without immediate
    collapse. \n\nIt is difficult with the physical pushing model to imagine eight
    men withstanding the pushing force of 25 opponents for a matter of seconds, let
    alone half the battle.\nSuch arguments have led to a wave of counter-criticism
    to physical shoving theorists. \n\nAdrian Goldsworthy, in his article \"The Othismos,
    Myths and Heresies: The nature of Hoplite Battle\", argues that the physical
    pushing match model does not fit with the average casualty figures of hoplite
    warfare nor the practical realities of moving large formations of men in battle.
    \n\nThis debate has yet to be resolved amongst scholars.\nPractical difficulties
    with this theory also include the fact that, in a shoving match, an eight-foot
    spear is too long to fight effectively or even parry attacks. \n\nSpears enable
    a formation of men to keep their enemies at a distance, parry attacks aimed at
    them and their comrades, and give the necessary reach to strike multiple men
    in the opposite formation. \n\nA pushing match would put enemies so close together
    that a quick stabbing with a knife would kill the front row almost instantly.
    \n\nThe crush of men would also prevent the formation from withdrawing or retreating,
    which would result in much higher casualties than is recorded. \n\nThe speed
    at which this would occur would also end the battle very quickly, instead of
    prolonging it for hours.\n\n\n=== Shields ===\n\nEach individual hoplite carried
    his shield on his left arm, protecting not only himself but also the soldier
    to the left. \n\nThis meant that the men at the extreme right of the phalanx
    were only half-protected. \n\nIn battle, opposing phalanxes would try to exploit
    this weakness by attempting to overlap the enemy's right flank. \n\nIt also meant
    that, in battle, a phalanx would tend to drift to the right (as hoplites sought
    to remain behind the shield of their neighbor). \n\nSome groups, such as the
    Spartans at Nemea, tried to use this phenomenon to their advantage. \n\nIn this
    case, the phalanx would sacrifice its left side, which typically consisted of
    allied troops, in an effort to overtake the enemy from the flank. \n\nIt is unlikely
    that this strategy worked very often, as it is not mentioned frequently in ancient
    Greek literature.There was a leader in each row of a phalanx, and a rear rank
    officer, the ouragos (meaning tail-leader), who kept order in the rear. \n\nThe
    hoplites had to trust their neighbors to protect them and in turn be willing
    to protect their neighbors; a phalanx was thus only as strong as its weakest
    elements. \n\nThe effectiveness of the phalanx therefore depended on how well
    the hoplites could maintain this formation in combat and how well they could
    stand their ground, especially when engaged against another phalanx. \n\nFor
    this reason, the formation was deliberately organized to group friends and family
    close together, thus providing a psychological incentive to support one's fellows,
    and a disincentive, through shame, to panic or attempt to flee. \n\nThe more
    disciplined and courageous the army, the more likely it was to win \u2013 often
    engagements between the various city-states of Greece would be resolved by one
    side fleeing before the battle. \n\nThe Greek word dynamis, the 'will to fight',
    expresses the drive that kept hoplites in formation.\n\nNow of those, who dare,
    abiding one beside another, to advance to the close fray, and the foremost champions,
    fewer die, and they save the people in the rear; but in men that fear, all excellence
    is lost. \n\nNo one could ever in words go through those several ills, which
    befall a man, if he has been actuated by cowardice. \n\nFor 'tis grievous to
    wound in the rear the back of a flying man in hostile war. \n\nShameful too is
    a corpse lying low in the dust, wounded behind in the back by the point of a
    spear.\n\n\n=== Hoplite armament ===\n\nEach hoplite provided his own equipment.
    \n\nThe primary hoplite weapon was a spear around 2.4 metres (7.9 ft) in length
    called a dory. \n\nAlthough accounts of its length vary, it is usually now believed
    to have been seven to nine feet long (~2.1\u20132.7 m). \n\nIt was held one-handed,
    with the other hand holding the hoplite's shield (aspis). \n\nThe spearhead was
    usually a curved leaf shape, while the rear of the spear had a spike called a
    sauroter ('lizard-killer') which was used to stand the spear in the ground (hence
    the name). \n\nIt was also used as a secondary weapon if the main shaft snapped
    or to kill enemies lying on the ground. \n\nThis was a common problem, especially
    for soldiers who were involved in the initial clash with the enemy. \n\nDespite
    the snapping of the spear, hoplites could easily switch to the sauroter without
    great consequence. \n\nThe rear ranks used the secondary end to finish off fallen
    opponents as the phalanx advanced over them.\nThroughout the hoplite era, the
    standard hoplite armour went through many cyclical changes. \n\nAn Archaic hoplite
    typically wore a bronze breastplate, a bronze helmet with cheekplates, as well
    as greaves and other armour. \n\nLater, in the classical period, the breastplate
    became less common, replaced instead with a corselet that some claim was made
    of linothorax (layers of linen glued together), or perhaps of leather, sometimes
    covered in whole or in part with overlapping metal scales. \n\nEventually, even
    greaves became less commonly used, although degrees of heavier armour remained,
    as attested by Xenophon as late as 401 BC.These changes reflected the balancing
    of mobility with protection, especially as cavalry became more prominent in the
    Peloponnesian War and the need to combat light troops, which were increasingly
    used to negate the hoplite's role as the primary force in battle. \n\nYet bronze
    armour remained in some form until the end of the hoplite era. \n\nSome archaeologists
    have pointed out that bronze armour does not actually provide as much protection
    from direct blows as more extensive corselet padding, and have suggested its
    continued use was a matter of status for those who could afford it. \n\nIn the
    classical Greek dialect, there is no word for swordsmen; yet hoplites also carried
    a short sword called the xiphos, used as a secondary weapon if the dory was broken
    or lost. \n\nSamples of the xiphos recovered at excavation sites were typically
    around 60 cm (24 in) in length. \n\nThese swords were double-edged and could
    therefore be used as a cutting and thrusting weapon. \n\nThese short swords were
    often used to stab or cut at the enemy's neck during close combat.Hoplites carried
    a circular shield called a hoplon (often referred to as an aspis) made from wood
    and covered in bronze, measuring roughly 1 metre (3.3 ft) in diameter. \n\nIt
    spanned from chin to knee and was very heavy (8\u201315 kg (18\u201333 lb)).
    \n\nThis medium-sized shield (fairly large for the period considering the average
    male height) was made possible partly by its dish-like shape, which allowed it
    to be supported with the rim on the shoulder. \n\nThis was quite an important
    feature of the shield, especially for the hoplites that remained in the latter
    ranks. \n\nWhile these soldiers continued to help press forward, they did not
    have the added burden of holding up their shield. \n\nBut the circular shield
    was not without its disadvantages. \n\nDespite its mobility, protective curve,
    and double straps the circular shape created gaps in the shield wall at both
    its top and bottom. (Top gaps were somewhat reduced by the one or two spears
    jutting out of the gap. \n\nIn order to minimize the bottom gaps, thick leather
    'curtains' were used but only by an [unknown] percentage of the hoplites, possibly
    mostly in the first row only since there were disadvantages as well: considerable
    added weight on an already heavy shield and a certain additional cost.) These
    gaps left parts of the hoplite exposed to potentially lethal spear thrusts and
    were a persistent vulnerability for hoplites controlling the front lines.\n\n\n===
    Phalangite armament ===\n\nThe phalanx of the Ancient Macedonian kingdom and
    the later Hellenistic successor states was a development of the hoplite phalanx.
    \n\nThe 'phalangites' were armed with a much longer spear, the sarissa, and less
    heavily armoured. \n\nThe sarissa was the pike used by the ancient Macedonian
    army. \n\nIts actual length is unknown, but apparently it was twice as long as
    the dory. \n\nThis makes it at least 14 feet (4.3 m), but 18 feet (5.5 m) appears
    more likely. (The cavalry xyston was 12.5 feet (3.8 m) by comparison.) The great
    length of the pike was balanced by a counterweight at the rear end, which also
    functioned as a butt-spike, allowing the sarissa to be planted into the ground.
    \n\nBecause of its great length, weight and different balance, a sarissa was
    wielded two-handed. \n\nThis meant that the aspis was no longer a practical defence.
    \n\nInstead, the phalangites strapped a smaller pelte shield (usually reserved
    for peltasts, light skirmishers) to their left forearm. \n\nRecent theories,
    including examination of ancient frescoes depicting full sets of weapons and
    armor, claim that the shields used were actually larger than the pelte but smaller
    than the aspis, hanging by leather strap(s) from the left shoulder or from both
    shoulders. \n\nThe shield would retain handling straps in the inner curve, to
    be handled like a (smaller) aspis if the fight progressed to sword-wielding.
    \n\nAlthough in both shield size assumptions this reduced the shield wall, the
    extreme length of the spear kept the enemy at a greater distance, as the pikes
    of the first three to five ranks could all be brought to bear in front of the
    front row. \n\nThis pike had to be held underhand, as the shield would have obscured
    the soldier's vision had it been held overhead. \n\nIt would also be very hard
    to remove a sarissa from anything it stuck in (the earth, shields, and soldiers
    of the opposition) if it were thrust downwards, due to its length. \n\nThe Macedonian
    phalanx was much less able to form a shield wall, but the lengthened spears would
    have compensated for this. \n\nSuch a phalanx formation also reduced the likelihood
    that battles would degenerate into a pushing match.\n\n\n== Deployment and combat
    ==\n\n=== Phalanx composition and strength ===\n\nThe basic combat element of
    the Greek armies was either the stichos (meaning 'file'; usually 8\u201316 men
    strong) or the enomotia (meaning 'sworn' and made up by 2\u20134 stich\u0153,
    totaling up to 32 men), both led by a dim\u0153rites who was assisted by a decadarchos
    and two decaster\u0153 (sing. decasteros). \n\nFour to a maximum of 32 enomoti\xE6
    (depending on the era in question or the city) were forming a lochos led by a
    lochagos, who in this way was in command of initially 100 hoplites to a maximum
    of c. 500 in the late Hellenistic armies. \n\nHere, it has to be noted that the
    military manuals of Asclepiodotus and Aelian use the term lochos to denote a
    file in the phalanx. \n\nA taxis (mora for the Spartans) was the greatest standard
    hoplitic formation of 500 to 1500 men, led by a strategos (general). \n\nThe
    entire army, a total of several taxeis or mor\xE6 was led by a generals' council.
    \n\nThe commander-in-chief was usually called a polemarchos or a strategos autocrator.\n\n\n===
    Phalanx front and depth ===\n\nHoplite phalanxes usually deployed in ranks of
    eight men or more deep; the Macedonian phalanxes were usually 16 men deep, sometimes
    reported to have been arrayed 32 men deep. \n\nThere are some notable extremes;
    at the battles of Leuctra and Mantinea, the Theban general Epaminondas arranged
    the left wing of the phalanx into a \"hammerhead\" of 50 ranks of elite hoplites
    deep (see below) and when depth was less important, phalanxes just four deep
    are recorded, as at the battle of Marathon.The phalanx depth could vary depending
    on the needs of the moment and plans of the general. \n\nWhile the phalanx was
    in march, an eis bathos formation (loose, meaning literally 'in depth') was adopted
    in order to move more freely and maintain order. \n\nThis was also the initial
    battle formation as, in addition, it permitted friendly units to pass through
    whether assaulting or retreating. \n\nIn this status, the phalanx had twice the
    normal depth and each hoplite had to occupy about 1.8\u20132 metres (5 ft 11
    in\u20136 ft 7 in) in width. \n\nWhen enemy infantry was approaching, a rapid
    switch to the pycne (spelled also pucne) formation (dense or tight formation)
    was necessary. \n\nIn that case, each man's space was halved (0.9\u20131 metre
    or 2 feet 11 inches\u20133 feet 3 inches in width) and the formation depth returned
    to normal. \n\nAn even denser formation, the synaspismos or sunaspismos (ultra-tight
    or locked shields formation), was used when the phalanx was expected to experience
    extra pressure, intense missile volleys or frontal cavalry charges. \n\nIn synaspismos,
    the rank depth was half that of a normal phalanx and the width each man occupied
    was as small as 0.45 metres (1.5 ft).\n\n\n=== Stages of combat ===\n\nSeveral
    stages in hoplite combat can be defined:\nEphodos: The hoplites stop singing
    their p\xE6anes (battle hymns) and move towards the enemy, gradually picking
    up pace and momentum. \n\nIn the instants before impact, war cries (alalagm\u0153,
    sing. alalagmos) would be made. \n\nNotable war cries were the Athenian (eleleleleu!
    eleleleleu!) and the Macedonian (alalalalai! alalalalai!) alalagm\u0153.\nKrousis:
    The opposing phalanxes meet each other almost simultaneously along their front.
    \nDoratismos: Repeated, rapid spear thrusts in order to disrupt the enemy formation.
    \n\nThe use of long spears would keep enemies apart as well as allow men in a
    row to assist their comrades next to them. \n\nThe prodding could also open up
    a man to allow a comrade to spear him. \n\nToo hard prodding could get a spear
    stuck in a shield, which would necessitate someone in the back to lend his to
    the now-disarmed man.\nOthismos: Literally 'pushing' after most spears have been
    broken, the hoplites begin to push with their spears and spear shafts against
    their opponents' shields. \n\nThis could be the longest phase.Pararrhexis: 'Breaching'
    the opposing phalanx, the enemy formation shatters and the battle ends. \n\nCavalry
    would be used at this point to mop up the scattered enemy.\n\n\n== Tactics ==\n\nThe
    early history of the phalanx is largely one of combat between hoplite armies
    from competing Greek city-states. \n\nThe usual result was rather identical,
    inflexible formations pushing against each other until one broke. \n\nThe potential
    of the phalanx to achieve something more was demonstrated at Battle of Marathon
    (490 BC). \n\nFacing the much larger army of Darius I, the Athenians thinned
    out their phalanx and consequently lengthened their front, to avoid being outflanked.
    \n\nHowever, even a reduced-depth phalanx proved unstoppable to the lightly armed
    Persian infantry. \n\nAfter routing the Persian wings, the hoplites on the Athenian
    wings wheeled inwards, destroying the elite troop at the Persian centre, resulting
    in a crushing victory for Athens. \n\nThroughout the Greco-Persian Wars the hoplite
    phalanx was to prove superior to the Persian infantry (e.g. the battles of Thermopylae
    and Plataea).\nPerhaps the most prominent example of the phalanx's evolution
    was the oblique order, made famous in the Battle of Leuctra. \n\nThere, the Theban
    general Epaminondas thinned out the right flank and centre of his phalanx, and
    deepened his left flank to an unheard-of 50 men deep. \n\nIn doing so, Epaminondas
    reversed the convention by which the right flank of the phalanx was strongest.
    \n\nThis allowed the Thebans to assault in strength the elite Spartan troops
    on the right flank of the opposing phalanx. \n\nMeanwhile, the centre and right
    flank of the Theban line were echeloned back, from the opposing phalanx, keeping
    the weakened parts of the formation from being engaged. \n\nOnce the Spartan
    right had been routed by the Theban left, the remainder of the Spartan line also
    broke. \n\nThus, by localising the attacking power of the hoplites, Epaminondas
    was able to defeat an enemy previously thought invincible.\nPhilip II of Macedon
    spent several years in Thebes as a hostage, and paid attention to Epaminondas'
    innovations. \n\nOn return to his homeland, he raised a revolutionary new infantry
    force, which was to change the face of the Greek world. \n\nPhilip's phalangites
    were the first force of professional soldiers seen in Ancient Greece apart from
    Sparta. \n\nThey were armed with longer spears (the sarissa) and were drilled
    more thoroughly in more evolved, complicated tactics and manoeuvres. \n\nMore
    importantly, though, Philip's phalanx was part of a multi-faceted, combined force
    that included a variety of skirmishers and cavalry, most notably the famous Companion
    cavalry. \n\nThe Macedonian phalanx now was used to pin the centre of the enemy
    line, while cavalry and more mobile infantry struck at the foe's flanks. \n\nIts
    supremacy over the more static armies fielded by the Greek city-states was shown
    at the Battle of Chaeronea, where Philip II's army crushed the allied Theban
    and Athenian phalanxes.\n\n\n== Weaknesses ==\n\nThe hoplite phalanx was weakest
    when facing an enemy fielding lighter and more flexible troops without its own
    such supporting troops. \n\nAn example of this would be the Battle of Lechaeum,
    where an Athenian contingent led by Iphicrates routed an entire Spartan mora
    (a unit of anywhere from 500 to 900 hoplites). \n\nThe Athenian force had a considerable
    proportion of light missile troops armed with javelins and bows that wore down
    the Spartans with repeated attacks, causing disarray in the Spartan ranks and
    an eventual rout when they spotted Athenian heavy infantry reinforcements trying
    to flank them by boat.\nThe Macedonian phalanx had weaknesses similar to its
    hoplitic predecessor. \n\nTheoretically indestructible from the front, its flanks
    and rear were very vulnerable, and once engaged it may not easily disengage or
    redeploy to face a threat from those directions. \n\nThus, a phalanx facing non-phalangite
    formations required some sort of protection on its flanks\u2014lighter or at
    least more mobile infantry, cavalry, etc. \n\nThis was shown at the Battle of
    Magnesia, where, once the Seleucid supporting cavalry elements were driven off,
    the phalanx was static and unable to go on the offensive against its Roman opponents
    (although they continued to resist stoutly and attempted a fighting withdrawal
    under a hail of Roman missiles, until the elephants posted on their flanks panicked
    and disrupted their formation).\nThe Macedonian phalanx could also lose its cohesion
    without proper coordination or while moving through broken terrain; doing so
    could create gaps between individual blocks/syntagmata, or could prevent a solid
    front within those sub-units as well, causing other sections of the line to bunch
    up. \n\nIn this event, as in the battles of Cynoscephalae and Pydna, the phalanx
    became vulnerable to attacks by more flexible units\u2014such as Roman legionary
    centuries, which were able to avoid the sarissae and engage in hand-to-hand combat
    with the phalangites.\nAnother important area that must be considered concerns
    the psychological tendencies of the hoplites. \n\nBecause the strength of a phalanx
    depended on the ability of the hoplites to maintain their frontline, it was crucial
    that a phalanx be able to quickly and efficiently replace fallen soldiers in
    the front ranks. \n\nIf a phalanx failed to do this in a structured manner, the
    opposing phalanx would have an opportunity to breach the line which, many times,
    would lead to a quick defeat. \n\nThis then implies that the hoplites ranks closer
    to the front must be mentally prepared to replace their fallen comrade and adapt
    to his new position without disrupting the structure of the frontline.Finally,
    most of the phalanx-centric armies tended to lack supporting echelons behind
    the main line of battle. \n\nThis meant that breaking through the line of battle
    or compromising one of its flanks often ensured victory.\n\n\n== Classical decline
    and post-classical use ==\n\nAfter reaching its zenith in the conquests of Alexander
    the Great, the phalanx began a slow decline, as Macedonian successor states declined.
    \n\nThe combined arms tactics used by Alexander and his father were gradually
    replaced by a return to the simpler frontal charge tactics of the hoplite phalanx.
    \n\nThe expense of the supporting arms and cavalry, and the widespread use of
    mercenaries, caused the Diadochi to rely on phalanx vs. phalanx tactics during
    the Wars of the Diadochi.\nThe decline of the Diadochi and the phalanx was linked
    with the rise of Rome and the Roman legions from the 3rd century BC. \n\nThe
    Battle of the Caudine Forks showed the clumsiness of the Roman phalanx against
    the Samnites. \n\nThe Romans had originally employed the phalanx themselves but
    gradually evolved more flexible tactics. \n\nThe result was the three-line Roman
    legion of the middle period of the Roman Republic, the Manipular System. \n\nRomans
    used a phalanx for their third military line, the triarii. \n\nThese were veteran
    reserve troops armed with the hastae or spear. \n\nRome conquered most of the
    Macedonian successor states. \n\nAlso the various Greek city-states and leagues.
    \n\nAs these states ceased to exist, so did the armies which used the traditional
    phalanx. \n\nSubsequently, troops from these regions were equipped, trained and
    fought using the Roman model.\nA phalanx formation called the phoulkon appeared
    in the late Roman army and Byzantine army. \n\nIt had characteristics of the
    classical Greek and Hellenistic phalanxes, but was more flexible. \n\nIt was
    used against cavalry more than infantry.\nHowever, the phalanx did not totally
    disappear. \n\nIn some battles between the Roman army and Hellenistic phalanxes,
    such as Pydna (168 BC), Cynoscephalae (197 BC) and Magnesia (190 BC), the phalanx
    performed well. \n\nIt even drove back the Roman infantry. \n\nHowever, at Cynoscephalae
    and Magnesia, failure to defend the flanks of the phalanx led to defeat. \n\nAt
    Pydna, the phalanx lost cohesion when pursuing retreating Roman soldiers. \n\nThis
    allowed the Romans to penetrate the formation. \n\nThen, Roman close combat skills
    proved decisive. \n\nThe historian Polybius details the effectiveness of the
    Roman legion against the phalanx. \n\nHe deduces that the Romans refused to fight
    the phalanx where the phalanx was effective, Romans offered battle only when
    a legion could exploit the clumsiness and immobility of a phalanx.\n\nSpear-armed
    troops continued to be important elements in many armies until reliable firearms
    became available. \n\nThese did not necessarily fight as a phalanx. \n\nFor example,
    compare the classical phalanx and late medieval pike formations.Military historians
    have suggested that the Scots under William Wallace and Robert the Bruce consciously
    imitated the Hellenistic phalanx to produce the Scots 'hedgehog' or schiltron.
    \n\nHowever, long spears might have been used by Picts and others in Scotlands'
    Early Middle Ages. \n\nPrior to 1066, long spear tactics (also found in North
    Wales) might have been part of irregular warfare in Britain. \n\nThe Scots used
    imported French pikes and dynamic tactics at the Battle of Flodden. \n\nHowever,
    Flodden found the Scots pitted against effective light artillery, while advancing
    over bad ground. \n\nThe combination disorganised the Scotts phalanxes and permitted
    effective attacks by English longbowmen, and soldiers wielding shorter, handier
    polearms called bills. \n\nSome contemporary sources might say that the bills
    cut off the heads of Scots pikes.\nThe pike was briefly reconsidered as a weapon
    by European armies in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. \n\nIt could protect
    riflemen, whose slower rate of fire made them vulnerable. \n\nA collapsible pike
    was invented but never issued. \n\nThe Confederate Army considered these for
    the American Civil War. \n\nSome were even manufactured but probably were never
    issued. \n\nPikes were manufactured during World War II as \"Croft's Pikes\".\nWhile
    obsolete in military practice, the phalanx remained in use as a metaphor of warriors
    moving forward as a single united block. \n\nThis metaphor inspired several 20th-century
    political movements, notably the Spanish Falange and its ideology of Falangism.\nThe
    Byzantines continued and improved the use of the classical Greek phalanx alongside
    the Macedonian-style phalanx. \n\nThe latter was based on a model that Alexander
    himself had created and had tried to give more importance to the skirmishers
    and cavalry, yet it never saw action until the Byzantines adopted the model that
    rely in a mixture of many units sometimes. \n\nMany writers of the age describe
    the spear as being a sarissa yet it was a meter short than the original sarissa
    and had being modified by the time, yet the term for the long spear remained
    alongside with its other names.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phalanx"

  descriptionText: "\n\nNINTH RIB\n\n\n== Structure of the rib cage ==\n\nRibs are
    described based on their location and connection with the sternum. \n\nAll ribs
    are attached posteriorly to the thoracic vertebrae and are numbered accordingly
    one to twelve. \n\nRibs that articulate directly with the sternum are called
    true ribs, whereas those that do not articulate directly are termed false ribs.
    \n\n\n=== Attachment of the rib cage ===\n\nThe terms true ribs and false ribs
    describe rib pairs that are directly or indirectly attached to the sternum. \n\nThe
    first seven rib pairs known as the fixed or vertebrosternal ribs are the true
    ribs (Latin: costae verae) as they connect directly to the sternum; the next
    five pairs (eighth to twelfth) are the false ribs (Latin: costae spuriae). \n\n\n===
    Parts of rib (general) ===\n\nEach rib consists of a head, neck, and a shaft.
    \n\nAll ribs are attached posteriorly to the thoracic vertebrae. \n\nThey are
    numbered to match the vertebrae they attach to \u2013 one to twelve, from top
    (T1) to bottom. \n\nThe head of the rib is the end part closest to the vertebra
    with which it articulates. \n\nIt is marked by a kidney-shaped articular surface
    which is divided by a horizontal crest into two articulating regions. \n\nThe
    upper region articulates with the inferior costal facet on the vertebra above,
    and the larger region articulates with the superior costal facet on the vertebra
    with the same number. \n\nThe transverse process of a thoracic vertebra also
    articulates at the transverse costal facet with the tubercle of the rib of the
    same number. \n\nThe crest gives attachment to the intra-articular ligament.The
    neck of the rib is the flattened part that extends laterally from the head. \n\nThe
    neck is about 3 cm long. \n\nIts anterior surface is flat and smooth, whilst
    its posterior is perforated by numerous foramina and its surface rough, to give
    attachment to the ligament of the neck. \n\nIts upper border presents a rough
    crest (crista colli costae) for the attachment of the anterior costotransverse
    ligament; its lower border is rounded.\n\nOn the posterior surface at the neck,
    is an eminence\u2014the tubercle that consists of an articular and a non-articular
    portion. \n\nThe articular portion is the lower and more medial of the two and
    presents a small, oval surface for articulation with the transverse costal facet
    on the end of the transverse process of the lower of the two vertebrae to which
    the head is connected. \n\nThe non-articular portion is a rough elevation and
    affords attachment to the ligament of the tubercle. \n\nThe tubercle is much
    more prominent in the upper ribs than in the lower ribs.\n\nThe angle of a rib
    (costal angle) may both refer to the bending part of it, and a prominent line
    in this area, a little in front of the tubercle. \n\nThis line is directed downward
    and laterally; this gives attachment to a tendon of the iliocostalis muscle.
    \n\nAt this point, the rib is bent in two directions, and at the same time twisted
    on its long axis.\n\nThe distance between the angle and the tubercle is progressively
    greater from the second to the tenth ribs. \n\nThe area between the angle and
    the tubercle is rounded, rough, and irregular, and serves for the attachment
    of the longissimus dorsi muscle.\n\n\n==== Ribs and vertebrae ====\n\nThe first
    rib (the topmost one) is the most curved and usually the shortest of all the
    ribs; it is broad and flat, its surfaces looking upward and downward, and its
    borders inward and outward.\n        \nThe head is small and rounded, and possesses
    only a single articular facet, for articulation with the body of the first thoracic
    vertebra. \n\nThe neck is narrow and rounded. \n\nThe tubercle, thick and prominent,
    is placed on the outer border. \n\nIt bears a small facet for articulation with
    the transverse costal facet on the transverse process of T1. \n\nThere is no
    angle, but at the tubercle, the rib is slightly bent, with the convexity upward,
    so that the head of the bone is directed downward. \n\nThe upper surface of the
    body is marked by two shallow grooves, separated from each other by a slight
    ridge prolonged internally into a tubercle, the scalene tubercle, for the attachment
    of the anterior scalene; the anterior groove transmits the subclavian vein, the
    posterior the subclavian artery and the lowest trunk of the brachial plexus.
    \n\nBehind the posterior groove is a rough area for the attachment of the medial
    scalene. \n\nThe under surface is smooth and without a costal groove. \n\nThe
    outer border is convex, thick, and rounded, and at its posterior part gives attachment
    to the first digitation of the serratus anterior. \n\nThe inner border is concave,
    thin, and sharp, and marked about its center by the scalene tubercle. \n\nThe
    anterior extremity is larger and thicker than that of any of the other ribs.\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rib_cage"

  descriptionText: "\n\nMETACARPAL BONES\n\n\nIn human anatomy, the metacarpal bones
    or metacarpus, form the intermediate part of the skeletal hand located between
    the phalanges of the fingers and the carpal bones of the wrist which forms the
    connection to the forearm. \n\nThe metacarpal bones are analogous to the metatarsal
    bones in the foot.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\n\nThe metacarpals form a transverse
    arch to which the rigid row of distal carpal bones are fixed. \n\nThe peripheral
    metacarpals (those of the thumb and little finger) form the sides of the cup
    of the palmar gutter and as they are brought together they deepen this concavity.
    \n\nThe index metacarpal is the most firmly fixed, while the thumb metacarpal
    articulates with the trapezium and acts independently from the others. \n\nThe
    middle metacarpals are tightly united to the carpus by intrinsic interlocking
    bone elements at their bases. \n\nThe ring metacarpal is somewhat more mobile
    while the fifth metacarpal is semi-independent.Each metacarpal bone consists
    of a body or shaft, and two extremities: the head at the distal or digital end
    (near the fingers), and the base at the proximal or carpal end (close to the
    wrist).\n\n\n=== Body ===\n\nThe body (shaft) is prismoid in form, and curved,
    so as to be convex in the longitudinal direction behind, concave in front. \n\nIt
    presents three surfaces: medial, lateral, and dorsal.\n\nThe medial and lateral
    surfaces are concave, for the attachment of the interosseus muscles, and separated
    from one another by a prominent anterior ridge.\n\nThe dorsal surface presents
    in its distal two-thirds a smooth, triangular, flattened area which is covered
    in by the tendons of the extensor muscles. \n\nThis surface is bounded by two
    lines, which commence in small tubercles situated on either side of the digital
    extremity, and, passing upward, converge and meet some distance above the center
    of the bone and form a ridge which runs along the rest of the dorsal surface
    to the carpal extremity. \n\nThis ridge separates two sloping surfaces for the
    attachment of the interossei dorsales.\n\nTo the tubercles on the digital extremities
    are attached the collateral ligaments of the metacarpophalangeal joints.\n\n\n===
    Base ===\n\nThe base (basis) or carpal extremity is of a cuboidal form, and broader
    behind than in front: it articulates with the carpal bones and with the adjoining
    metacarpal bones; its dorsal and volar surfaces are rough, for the attachment
    of ligaments.\n\n\n=== Head ===\n\nThe head (caput) or digital extremity presents
    an oblong surface markedly convex from before backward, less so transversely,
    and flattened from side to side; it articulates with the proximal phalanx. \n\nIt
    is broader, and extends farther upward, on the volar than on the dorsal aspect,
    and is longer in the antero-posterior than in the transverse diameter. \n\nOn
    either side of the head is a tubercle for the attachment of the collateral ligament
    of the metacarpophalangeal joint.\n\nThe dorsal surface, broad and flat, supports
    the tendons of the extensor muscles.\n\nThe volar surface is grooved in the middle
    line for the passage of the flexor tendons, and marked on either side by an articular
    eminence continuous with the terminal articular surface.\n\n\n=== Neck ===\n\nThe
    neck, or subcapital segment, is the transition zone between the body and the
    head.\n\n\n=== Articulations ===\n\nBesides the metacarpophalangeal joints, the
    metacarpal bones articulate by carpometacarpal joints as follows:\n\n-the first
    with the trapezium;\n-the second with the trapezium, trapezoid, capitate and
    third metacarpal;\n-the third with the capitate and second and fourth metacarpals;\n-the
    fourth with the capitate, hamate, and third and fifth metacarpals;\n-and the
    fifth with the hamate and fourth metacarpal;\n        \n\n\n=== Insertions ===\n\n-Extensor
    Carpi Radialis Longus/Brevis: Both insert on the base of metacarpal II; Assist
    with wrist extension and radial flexion of the wrist\n-Extensor Carpi Ulnaris:
    Inserts on the base of metacarpal V; Extends and fixes wrist when digits are
    being flexed; assists with ulnar flexion of wrist\n-Abductor Pollicis Longus:
    Inserts on the trapezium and base of metacarpal I; Abducts thumb in frontal plane;
    extends thumb at carpometacarpal joint\n-Opponens Pollicis: Inserts on metacarpal
    I; flexes metacarpal I to oppose the thumb to the fingertips\n-Opponens digiti
    minimi: Inserts on the medial surface of metacarpal V; Flexes metacarpal V at
    carpometacarpal joint when little finger is moved into opposition with tip of
    thumb; deepens palm of hand.\n\n        \n\n\n== Clinical significance ==\n\n===
    Congenital disorders ===\n\nThe fourth and fifth metacarpal bones are commonly
    \"blunted\" or shortened, in pseudohypoparathyroidism and pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism.\n\nA
    blunted fourth metacarpal, with normal fifth metacarpal, can signify Turner syndrome.\n\nBlunted
    metacarpals (particularly the fourth metacarpal) are a symptom of Nevoid basal
    cell carcinoma syndrome.\n\n\n=== Fracture ===\n\nThe neck of a metacarpal is
    a common location for a boxer's fracture. \n\nHowever, all parts of the metacarpal
    bone (including head, body and base) are susceptible to fracture. \n\nFor these
    fractures several types of treatment exist ranging from non-operative techniques
    with or without immobilization to operative techniques using closed or open reduction
    and internal fixation (ORIF). \n\nGenerally speaking most fractures showing little
    or no displacement can be treated successfully without surgery. \n\nIntraarticular
    fracture-dislocations of the metacarpal head or base may require surgical fixation,
    as fragment displacement affecting the joint surface is rarely tolerated well.\n\n\n==
    Other animals ==\n\nIn four-legged animals, the metacarpals form part of the
    forefeet, and are frequently reduced in number, appropriate to the number of
    toes. \n\nIn digitigrade and unguligrade animals, the metacarpals are greatly
    extended and strengthened, forming an additional segment to the limb, a feature
    that typically enhances the animal's speed. \n\nIn both birds and bats, the metacarpals
    form part of the wing.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Etymology ===\n\nThe Greek physician
    Galen used to refer to the metacarpus as \u03BC\u03B5\u03C4\u03B1\u03BA\u03AC\u03C1\u03C0\u03B9\u03BF\u03BD.
    \n\nThe Latin form metacarpium more truly resembles its Ancient Greek predecessor
    \u03BC\u03B5\u03C4\u03B1\u03BA\u03AC\u03C1\u03C0\u03B9\u03BF\u03BD than metacarpus.
    \n\nMeta\u2013 is Greek for beyond and carpal from Ancient Greek \u03BA\u03B1\u03C1\u03C0\u03CC\u03C2
    (karp\xF3s, \u201Cwrist\u201D).\n\nIn anatomic Latin, adjectives like metacarpius,
    metacarpicus, metacarpiaeus, metacarpeus, metacarpianus and metacarpalis can
    be found. \n\nThe form metacarpius is more true to the later Greek form \u03BC\u03B5\u03C4\u03B1\u03BA\u03AC\u03C1\u03C0\u03B9\u03BF\u03C2.
    \n\nMetacarpalis, as in ossa metacarpalia in the current official Latin nomenclature,
    Terminologia Anatomica is a compound consisting of Latin and Greek parts. \n\nThe
    usage of such hybrids in anatomic Latin is disapproved by some.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacarpal_bones"

  descriptionText: "\n\nTENTH RIB\n\n\n== Structure of the rib cage ==\n\nRibs are
    described based on their location and connection with the sternum. \n\nAll ribs
    are attached posteriorly to the thoracic vertebrae and are numbered accordingly
    one to twelve. \n\nRibs that articulate directly with the sternum are called
    true ribs, whereas those that do not articulate directly are termed false ribs.
    \n\n\n=== Attachment of the rib cage ===\n\nThe terms true ribs and false ribs
    describe rib pairs that are directly or indirectly attached to the sternum. \n\nThe
    first seven rib pairs known as the fixed or vertebrosternal ribs are the true
    ribs (Latin: costae verae) as they connect directly to the sternum; the next
    five pairs (eighth to twelfth) are the false ribs (Latin: costae spuriae). \n\n\n===
    Parts of rib (general) ===\n\nEach rib consists of a head, neck, and a shaft.
    \n\nAll ribs are attached posteriorly to the thoracic vertebrae. \n\nThey are
    numbered to match the vertebrae they attach to \u2013 one to twelve, from top
    (T1) to bottom. \n\nThe head of the rib is the end part closest to the vertebra
    with which it articulates. \n\nIt is marked by a kidney-shaped articular surface
    which is divided by a horizontal crest into two articulating regions. \n\nThe
    upper region articulates with the inferior costal facet on the vertebra above,
    and the larger region articulates with the superior costal facet on the vertebra
    with the same number. \n\nThe transverse process of a thoracic vertebra also
    articulates at the transverse costal facet with the tubercle of the rib of the
    same number. \n\nThe crest gives attachment to the intra-articular ligament.The
    neck of the rib is the flattened part that extends laterally from the head. \n\nThe
    neck is about 3 cm long. \n\nIts anterior surface is flat and smooth, whilst
    its posterior is perforated by numerous foramina and its surface rough, to give
    attachment to the ligament of the neck. \n\nIts upper border presents a rough
    crest (crista colli costae) for the attachment of the anterior costotransverse
    ligament; its lower border is rounded.\n\nOn the posterior surface at the neck,
    is an eminence\u2014the tubercle that consists of an articular and a non-articular
    portion. \n\nThe articular portion is the lower and more medial of the two and
    presents a small, oval surface for articulation with the transverse costal facet
    on the end of the transverse process of the lower of the two vertebrae to which
    the head is connected. \n\nThe non-articular portion is a rough elevation and
    affords attachment to the ligament of the tubercle. \n\nThe tubercle is much
    more prominent in the upper ribs than in the lower ribs.\n\nThe angle of a rib
    (costal angle) may both refer to the bending part of it, and a prominent line
    in this area, a little in front of the tubercle. \n\nThis line is directed downward
    and laterally; this gives attachment to a tendon of the iliocostalis muscle.
    \n\nAt this point, the rib is bent in two directions, and at the same time twisted
    on its long axis.\n\nThe distance between the angle and the tubercle is progressively
    greater from the second to the tenth ribs. \n\nThe area between the angle and
    the tubercle is rounded, rough, and irregular, and serves for the attachment
    of the longissimus dorsi muscle.\n\n\n==== Ribs and vertebrae ====\n\nThe first
    rib (the topmost one) is the most curved and usually the shortest of all the
    ribs; it is broad and flat, its surfaces looking upward and downward, and its
    borders inward and outward.\n        \nThe head is small and rounded, and possesses
    only a single articular facet, for articulation with the body of the first thoracic
    vertebra. \n\nThe neck is narrow and rounded. \n\nThe tubercle, thick and prominent,
    is placed on the outer border. \n\nIt bears a small facet for articulation with
    the transverse costal facet on the transverse process of T1. \n\nThere is no
    angle, but at the tubercle, the rib is slightly bent, with the convexity upward,
    so that the head of the bone is directed downward. \n\nThe upper surface of the
    body is marked by two shallow grooves, separated from each other by a slight
    ridge prolonged internally into a tubercle, the scalene tubercle, for the attachment
    of the anterior scalene; the anterior groove transmits the subclavian vein, the
    posterior the subclavian artery and the lowest trunk of the brachial plexus.
    \n\nBehind the posterior groove is a rough area for the attachment of the medial
    scalene. \n\nThe under surface is smooth and without a costal groove. \n\nThe
    outer border is convex, thick, and rounded, and at its posterior part gives attachment
    to the first digitation of the serratus anterior. \n\nThe inner border is concave,
    thin, and sharp, and marked about its center by the scalene tubercle. \n\nThe
    anterior extremity is larger and thicker than that of any of the other ribs.\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rib_cage"

  descriptionText: "\n\nMETATARSAL BONES\n\n\nThe metatarsal bones, or metatarsus
    are a group of five long bones in the foot, located between the tarsal bones
    of the hind- and mid-foot and the phalanges of the toes. \n\nLacking individual
    names, the metatarsal bones are numbered from the medial side (the side of the
    great toe): the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth metatarsal (often depicted
    with Roman numerals). \n\nThe metatarsals are analogous to the metacarpal bones
    of the hand. \n\nThe lengths of the metatarsal bones in humans are, in descending
    order: second, third, fourth, fifth and first.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe five
    metatarsals are dorsally convex long bones consisting of a shaft or body, a base
    (proximally), and a head (distally). \n\nThe body is prismoid in form, tapers
    gradually from the tarsal to the phalangeal extremity, and is curved longitudinally,
    so as to be concave below, slightly convex above. \n\nThe base or posterior extremity
    is wedge-shaped, articulating proximally with the tarsal bones, and by its sides
    with the contiguous metatarsal bones: its dorsal and plantar surfaces are rough
    for the attachment of ligaments. \n\nThe head or distal extremity presents a
    convex articular surface, oblong from above downward, and extending farther backward
    below than above. \n\nIts sides are flattened, and on each is a depression, surmounted
    by a tubercle, for ligamentous attachment. \n\nIts plantar surface is grooved
    antero-posteriorly for the passage of the flexor tendons, and marked on either
    side by an articular eminence continuous with the terminal articular surface.\n\nDuring
    growth, the growth plates are located distally on the metatarsals, except on
    the first metatarsal where it is located proximally. \n\nYet it is quite common
    to have an accessory growth plate on the distal first metatarsal.\n\n\n=== Articulations
    ===\n\n\nThe base of each metatarsal bone articulates with one or more of the
    tarsal bones at the tarsometatarsal joints, and the head with one of the first
    row of phalanges at the metatarsophalangeal joints. \n\nTheir bases also articulate
    with each other at the intermetatarsal joints\n\n-The first metatarsal articulates
    with the medial cuneiform, and to a small extent to the intermediate cuneiform.\n-the
    second with all three cuneiforms.\n-the third with the lateral cuneiform.\n-the
    fourth with the lateral cuneiform and the cuboid.\n-The fifth with the cuboid.\n\n\n==
    Clinical significance ==\n\n=== Injuries ===\n\nThe metatarsal bones are often
    broken by association football players. \n\nThese and other recent cases have
    been attributed to the lightweight design of modern football boots, which provide
    less protection to the foot. \n\nIn 2010 some soccer players began testing a
    new sock that incorporated a rubber silicone pad over the foot to provide protection
    to the top of the foot. \n\nStress fractures are thought to account for 16% of
    injuries related to sports participation, and the metatarsals are the bones most
    often involved. \n\nThese fractures are sometimes called march fractures, based
    on their traditional association with military recruits after long marches. \n\nThe
    second and third metatarsals are fixed while walking, thus these metatarsals
    are common sites of injury. \n\nThe fifth metatarsal may be fractured if the
    foot is oversupinated during locomotion.Protection from injuries can be given
    by the use of safety footwear which can use built-in or removable metatarsal
    guards.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metatarsal_bones"

  descriptionText: "\n\nMAJOR ALAR CARTILAGE\n\n\nThe major alar cartilages are positioned
    with one structure on each side of the nasal tip. \n\nSuperiorly, the major alar
    cartilages are connected to the lateral nasal cartilage via fibrous tissues.
    \n\nComposed of hyaline cartilage, these structures are very thin and folded
    to form the lateral and medial crus. \n\nThe medial crus is the inner portion
    of the major alar cartilages that are situated perpendicularly to the septal
    nasal cartilage. \n\nThe lateral crus is the outer portion of the major alar
    cartilages that associate with the ala of the nose.\n\nBoth crus come together
    to form an oval tip at each nostril. \n\nBoth sides of the major alar cartilages
    merge together to form a notch at the tip, which is referred to as the apex of
    the nose. \n\nWith the formation of the medial and lateral walls within the nares,
    the major alar cartilages function to hold open each naris. \n\nThis allows maximal
    airflow to reach the nasal valve, allowing optimal respiration. \n\nDue to weakness
    corresponding with the lateral crus in certain individuals, a technique called
    sliding alar cartilage (SAC) has been a procedure practiced to restructure and
    support the nasal tip.\n"

  descriptionText: "\n\nTRIQUETRUM/TRIQUETRAL BONE\n\n\nThe triquetral bone also
    called triquetrum, pyramidal, three-faced, and formerly cuneiform bone) is located
    in the wrist on the medial side of the proximal row of the carpus between the
    lunate and pisiform bones. \n\nIt is on the ulnar side of the hand, but does
    not articulate with the ulna. \n\nIt connects with the pisiform, hamate, and
    lunate bones. \n\nIt is the 3rd most commonly fractured carpal bone.\n\n\n==
    Structure ==\n\nThe triquetral is one of the eight carpal bones of the hand.
    \n\nIt is a three-faced bone found within the proximal row of carpal bones. \n\nSituated
    beneath the pisiform, it is one of the carpal bones that form the carpal arch,
    within which lies the carpal tunnel. \n\nThe triquetral bone may be distinguished
    by its pyramidal shape, and by an oval isolated facet for articulation with the
    pisiform bone. \n\nIt is situated at the upper and ulnar side of the carpus.
    \n\nTo facilitate its palpation in an exam, the hand must be radially deviated
    so that the triquetrium moves out from under the ulnar styloid process. \n\nThe
    triquetrum may be difficult to find, since it also lies under the pisiform.\n\n\n==
    Ossification ==\n\nThe triquetral bone ossifies between 9 months and 50 months
    (4 years and 2 months).\n\n\n=== Surfaces ===\n\nThe superior surface presents
    a medial, rough, non-articular portion, and a lateral convex articular portion
    which articulates with the triangular articular disk of the wrist.\n\nThe inferior
    surface, directed lateralward, is concave, sinuously curved, and smooth for articulation
    with the hamate. \n\nThe dorsal surface is rough for the attachment of ligaments.\nThe
    volar surface presents, on its medial part, an oval facet, for articulation with
    the pisiform; its lateral part is rough for ligamentous attachment.\n\nThe lateral
    surface, the base of the pyramid, is marked by a flat, quadrilateral facet, for
    articulation with the lunate.\n\nThe medial surface, the summit of the pyramid,
    is pointed and roughened, for the attachment of the ulnar collateral ligament
    of the wrist.\n\n\n=== In animals ===\n\nIn reptiles and amphibians, the bone
    is instead referred to as the ulnare, since (at least in the most primitive fossils)
    it articulates with the ulna.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\nThe carpal bones function
    as a unit to provide a bony superstructure for the hand.\n\n\n== Fracture ==\n\nTriquetral
    fractures can occur due to forceful flexion of the wrist, causing an avulsion
    of the dorsal aspect of the bone that is often hidden on anterior radiographs,
    but can be seen as a tiny bone fragment on lateral views.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe
    etymology derives from the Latin triquetrus which means \"three-cornered.\" \n\nTherefore,
    it is sometimes also called the triangular bone or os triangulare. \n\nHowever,
    os triangulare may also refer to a nearby accessory bone.\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triquetral_bone"

  descriptionText: "\n\nPHALANX\n\n\nThe phalanx (Ancient Greek: \u03C6\u03AC\u03BB\u03B1\u03B3\u03BE;
    plural phalanxes or phalanges, \u03C6\u03AC\u03BB\u03B1\u03B3\u03B3\u03B5\u03C2,
    phalanges) was a rectangular mass military formation, usually composed entirely
    of heavy infantry armed with spears, pikes, sarissas, or similar pole weapons.
    \n\nThe term is particularly used to describe the use of this formation in Ancient
    Greek warfare, although the ancient Greek writers used it to also describe any
    massed infantry formation, regardless of its equipment. \n\nArrian uses the term
    in his Array against the Alans when he refers to his legions. \n\nIn Greek texts,
    the phalanx may be deployed for battle, on the march, or even camped, thus describing
    the mass of infantry or cavalry that would deploy in line during battle. \n\nThey
    marched forward as one entity. \nThe term itself, as used today, does not refer
    to a distinctive military unit or division (e.g., the Roman legion or the contemporary
    Western-type battalion), but to the type of formation of an army's troops. \n\nTherefore,
    this term does not indicate a standard combat strength or composition but includes
    the total number of infantry, which is deployed in a single formation known as
    a \"phalanx\".\nMany spear-armed troops historically fought in what might be
    termed phalanx-like formations. \n\nThis article focuses on the use of the military
    phalanx formation in Ancient Greece, the Hellenistic world, and other ancient
    states heavily influenced by Greek civilization.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe earliest
    known depiction of a phalanx-like formation occurs in a Sumerian stele from the
    25th century BC. \n\nHere the troops seem to have been equipped with spears,
    helmets, and large shields covering the whole body. \n\nAncient Egyptian infantry
    were known to have employed similar formations. \n\nThe first usage of the term
    phalanx comes from Homer's \"\u03C6\u03B1\u03BB\u03B1\u03B3\u03BE\", used to
    describe hoplites fighting in an organized battle line. \n\nHomer used the term
    to differentiate the formation-based combat from the individual duels so often
    found in his poems.Historians have not arrived at a consensus about the relationship
    between the Greek formation and these predecessors of the hoplites. \n\nThe principles
    of shield wall and spear hedge were almost universally known among the armies
    of major civilizations throughout history, and so the similarities may be related
    to convergent evolution instead of diffusion.\nTraditionally, historians date
    the origin of the hoplite phalanx of ancient Greece to the 8th century BC in
    Sparta, but this is under revision. \n\nIt is perhaps more likely that the formation
    was devised in the 7th century BC after the introduction of the aspis by the
    city of Argos, which would have made the formation possible. \n\nThis is further
    evidenced by the Chigi vase, dated to 650 BC, identifying hoplites armed with
    aspis, spear and panoply.Another possible theory as to the birth of Greek phalanx
    warfare stems from the idea that some of the basic aspects of the phalanx were
    present in earlier times yet were not fully developed due to the lack of appropriate
    technology. \n\nTwo of the basic tactics seen in earlier warfare include the
    principle of cohesion and the use of large groups of soldiers. \n\nThis would
    suggest that the Greek phalanx was rather the culmination and perfection of a
    slowly developed idea that originated many years earlier. \n\nAs weaponry and
    armour advanced through the years in different city-states, the phalanx became
    complex and effective.\n\n\n== Overview ==\n\nThe hoplite phalanx of the Archaic
    and Classical periods in Greece (c. 800\u2013350 BC) was the formation in which
    the hoplites would line up in ranks in close order. \n\nThe hoplites would lock
    their shields together, and the first few ranks of soldiers would project their
    spears out over the first rank of shields. \n\nThe phalanx therefore presented
    a shield wall and a mass of spear points to the enemy, making frontal assaults
    against it very difficult. \n\nIt also allowed a higher proportion of the soldiers
    to be actively engaged in combat at a given time (rather than just those in the
    front rank).\nBattles between two phalanxes usually took place in open, flat
    plains where it was easier to advance and stay in formation. \n\nRough terrain
    or hilly regions would have made it difficult to maintain a steady line and would
    have defeated the purpose of a phalanx. \n\nAs a result, battles between Greek
    city-states would not take place in just any location, nor would they be limited
    to sometimes obvious strategic points. \n\nRather, many times, the two opposing
    sides would find the most suitable piece of land where the conflict could be
    settled. \n\nTypically, the battle ended with one of the two fighting forces
    fleeing to safety.The phalanx usually advanced at a walking pace, although it
    is possible that they picked up speed during the last several yards. \n\nOne
    of the main reasons for this slow approach was to maintain formation. \n\nThe
    formation would be rendered useless if the phalanx was lost as the unit approached
    the enemy and could even become detrimental to the advancing unit, resulting
    in a weaker formation that was easier for an enemy force to break through. \n\nIf
    the hoplites of the phalanx were to pick up speed toward the latter part of the
    advance, it would have been for the purpose of gaining momentum against the enemy
    in the initial collision. \n\nHerodotus states of the Greeks at the Battle of
    Marathon, that \"They were the first Greeks we know of to charge their enemy
    at a run\". \n\nMany historians believe that this innovation was precipitated
    by their desire to minimize their losses from Persian archery. \n\nThe opposing
    sides would collide, possibly severing many of the spears of the row in front
    and killing the front part of the enemy army due to the bone-breaking collision.\nThe
    spears of a phalanx had spiked butts. \n\nIn battle, the back ranks used the
    spikes to finish fallen enemy soldiers.\n\n\n=== Pushing ===\n\nThe \"physical
    pushing match\" theory is one where the battle would rely on the valour of the
    men in the front line, whilst those in the rear maintained forward pressure on
    the front ranks with their shields, and the whole formation would consistently
    press forward trying to break the enemy formation. \n\nThis is the most widely
    accepted interpretation of the ancient sources thus when two phalanx formations
    engaged, the struggle essentially became a pushing match. \n\nHistorians such
    as Victor Davis Hanson point out that it is difficult to account for exceptionally
    deep phalanx formations unless they were necessary to facilitate the physical
    pushing depicted by this theory, as those behind the first two ranks could not
    take part in the actual spear thrusting.No Greek art ever depicts anything like
    a phalanx pushing match, so this hypothesis is a product of educated speculation
    rather than explicit testimony from contemporary sources and is far from being
    academically resolved. \n\nThe Greek term for \"push\" was used in the same metaphorical
    manner as the English word is (for example it was also used to describe the process
    of rhetorical arguments) and so does not necessarily describe a literal physical
    push, although it is possible that it did.\nFor instance, if Othismos were to
    accurately describe a physical pushing match, it would be logical to state that
    the deeper phalanx would always win an engagement since the physical strength
    of individuals would not compensate for even one additional rank on the enemy
    side. \n\nHowever, there are numerous examples of shallow phalanxes holding off
    an opponent. \n\nFor instance, at Delium in 424 BC, the Athenian left flank,
    a formation eight men deep, held off a formation of Thebans 25 deep without immediate
    collapse. \n\nIt is difficult with the physical pushing model to imagine eight
    men withstanding the pushing force of 25 opponents for a matter of seconds, let
    alone half the battle.\nSuch arguments have led to a wave of counter-criticism
    to physical shoving theorists. \n\nAdrian Goldsworthy, in his article \"The Othismos,
    Myths and Heresies: The nature of Hoplite Battle\", argues that the physical
    pushing match model does not fit with the average casualty figures of hoplite
    warfare nor the practical realities of moving large formations of men in battle.
    \n\nThis debate has yet to be resolved amongst scholars.\nPractical difficulties
    with this theory also include the fact that, in a shoving match, an eight-foot
    spear is too long to fight effectively or even parry attacks. \n\nSpears enable
    a formation of men to keep their enemies at a distance, parry attacks aimed at
    them and their comrades, and give the necessary reach to strike multiple men
    in the opposite formation. \n\nA pushing match would put enemies so close together
    that a quick stabbing with a knife would kill the front row almost instantly.
    \n\nThe crush of men would also prevent the formation from withdrawing or retreating,
    which would result in much higher casualties than is recorded. \n\nThe speed
    at which this would occur would also end the battle very quickly, instead of
    prolonging it for hours.\n\n\n=== Shields ===\n\nEach individual hoplite carried
    his shield on his left arm, protecting not only himself but also the soldier
    to the left. \n\nThis meant that the men at the extreme right of the phalanx
    were only half-protected. \n\nIn battle, opposing phalanxes would try to exploit
    this weakness by attempting to overlap the enemy's right flank. \n\nIt also meant
    that, in battle, a phalanx would tend to drift to the right (as hoplites sought
    to remain behind the shield of their neighbor). \n\nSome groups, such as the
    Spartans at Nemea, tried to use this phenomenon to their advantage. \n\nIn this
    case, the phalanx would sacrifice its left side, which typically consisted of
    allied troops, in an effort to overtake the enemy from the flank. \n\nIt is unlikely
    that this strategy worked very often, as it is not mentioned frequently in ancient
    Greek literature.There was a leader in each row of a phalanx, and a rear rank
    officer, the ouragos (meaning tail-leader), who kept order in the rear. \n\nThe
    hoplites had to trust their neighbors to protect them and in turn be willing
    to protect their neighbors; a phalanx was thus only as strong as its weakest
    elements. \n\nThe effectiveness of the phalanx therefore depended on how well
    the hoplites could maintain this formation in combat and how well they could
    stand their ground, especially when engaged against another phalanx. \n\nFor
    this reason, the formation was deliberately organized to group friends and family
    close together, thus providing a psychological incentive to support one's fellows,
    and a disincentive, through shame, to panic or attempt to flee. \n\nThe more
    disciplined and courageous the army, the more likely it was to win \u2013 often
    engagements between the various city-states of Greece would be resolved by one
    side fleeing before the battle. \n\nThe Greek word dynamis, the 'will to fight',
    expresses the drive that kept hoplites in formation.\n\nNow of those, who dare,
    abiding one beside another, to advance to the close fray, and the foremost champions,
    fewer die, and they save the people in the rear; but in men that fear, all excellence
    is lost. \n\nNo one could ever in words go through those several ills, which
    befall a man, if he has been actuated by cowardice. \n\nFor 'tis grievous to
    wound in the rear the back of a flying man in hostile war. \n\nShameful too is
    a corpse lying low in the dust, wounded behind in the back by the point of a
    spear.\n\n\n=== Hoplite armament ===\n\nEach hoplite provided his own equipment.
    \n\nThe primary hoplite weapon was a spear around 2.4 metres (7.9 ft) in length
    called a dory. \n\nAlthough accounts of its length vary, it is usually now believed
    to have been seven to nine feet long (~2.1\u20132.7 m). \n\nIt was held one-handed,
    with the other hand holding the hoplite's shield (aspis). \n\nThe spearhead was
    usually a curved leaf shape, while the rear of the spear had a spike called a
    sauroter ('lizard-killer') which was used to stand the spear in the ground (hence
    the name). \n\nIt was also used as a secondary weapon if the main shaft snapped
    or to kill enemies lying on the ground. \n\nThis was a common problem, especially
    for soldiers who were involved in the initial clash with the enemy. \n\nDespite
    the snapping of the spear, hoplites could easily switch to the sauroter without
    great consequence. \n\nThe rear ranks used the secondary end to finish off fallen
    opponents as the phalanx advanced over them.\nThroughout the hoplite era, the
    standard hoplite armour went through many cyclical changes. \n\nAn Archaic hoplite
    typically wore a bronze breastplate, a bronze helmet with cheekplates, as well
    as greaves and other armour. \n\nLater, in the classical period, the breastplate
    became less common, replaced instead with a corselet that some claim was made
    of linothorax (layers of linen glued together), or perhaps of leather, sometimes
    covered in whole or in part with overlapping metal scales. \n\nEventually, even
    greaves became less commonly used, although degrees of heavier armour remained,
    as attested by Xenophon as late as 401 BC.These changes reflected the balancing
    of mobility with protection, especially as cavalry became more prominent in the
    Peloponnesian War and the need to combat light troops, which were increasingly
    used to negate the hoplite's role as the primary force in battle. \n\nYet bronze
    armour remained in some form until the end of the hoplite era. \n\nSome archaeologists
    have pointed out that bronze armour does not actually provide as much protection
    from direct blows as more extensive corselet padding, and have suggested its
    continued use was a matter of status for those who could afford it. \n\nIn the
    classical Greek dialect, there is no word for swordsmen; yet hoplites also carried
    a short sword called the xiphos, used as a secondary weapon if the dory was broken
    or lost. \n\nSamples of the xiphos recovered at excavation sites were typically
    around 60 cm (24 in) in length. \n\nThese swords were double-edged and could
    therefore be used as a cutting and thrusting weapon. \n\nThese short swords were
    often used to stab or cut at the enemy's neck during close combat.Hoplites carried
    a circular shield called a hoplon (often referred to as an aspis) made from wood
    and covered in bronze, measuring roughly 1 metre (3.3 ft) in diameter. \n\nIt
    spanned from chin to knee and was very heavy (8\u201315 kg (18\u201333 lb)).
    \n\nThis medium-sized shield (fairly large for the period considering the average
    male height) was made possible partly by its dish-like shape, which allowed it
    to be supported with the rim on the shoulder. \n\nThis was quite an important
    feature of the shield, especially for the hoplites that remained in the latter
    ranks. \n\nWhile these soldiers continued to help press forward, they did not
    have the added burden of holding up their shield. \n\nBut the circular shield
    was not without its disadvantages. \n\nDespite its mobility, protective curve,
    and double straps the circular shape created gaps in the shield wall at both
    its top and bottom. (Top gaps were somewhat reduced by the one or two spears
    jutting out of the gap. \n\nIn order to minimize the bottom gaps, thick leather
    'curtains' were used but only by an [unknown] percentage of the hoplites, possibly
    mostly in the first row only since there were disadvantages as well: considerable
    added weight on an already heavy shield and a certain additional cost.) These
    gaps left parts of the hoplite exposed to potentially lethal spear thrusts and
    were a persistent vulnerability for hoplites controlling the front lines.\n\n\n===
    Phalangite armament ===\n\nThe phalanx of the Ancient Macedonian kingdom and
    the later Hellenistic successor states was a development of the hoplite phalanx.
    \n\nThe 'phalangites' were armed with a much longer spear, the sarissa, and less
    heavily armoured. \n\nThe sarissa was the pike used by the ancient Macedonian
    army. \n\nIts actual length is unknown, but apparently it was twice as long as
    the dory. \n\nThis makes it at least 14 feet (4.3 m), but 18 feet (5.5 m) appears
    more likely. (The cavalry xyston was 12.5 feet (3.8 m) by comparison.) The great
    length of the pike was balanced by a counterweight at the rear end, which also
    functioned as a butt-spike, allowing the sarissa to be planted into the ground.
    \n\nBecause of its great length, weight and different balance, a sarissa was
    wielded two-handed. \n\nThis meant that the aspis was no longer a practical defence.
    \n\nInstead, the phalangites strapped a smaller pelte shield (usually reserved
    for peltasts, light skirmishers) to their left forearm. \n\nRecent theories,
    including examination of ancient frescoes depicting full sets of weapons and
    armor, claim that the shields used were actually larger than the pelte but smaller
    than the aspis, hanging by leather strap(s) from the left shoulder or from both
    shoulders. \n\nThe shield would retain handling straps in the inner curve, to
    be handled like a (smaller) aspis if the fight progressed to sword-wielding.
    \n\nAlthough in both shield size assumptions this reduced the shield wall, the
    extreme length of the spear kept the enemy at a greater distance, as the pikes
    of the first three to five ranks could all be brought to bear in front of the
    front row. \n\nThis pike had to be held underhand, as the shield would have obscured
    the soldier's vision had it been held overhead. \n\nIt would also be very hard
    to remove a sarissa from anything it stuck in (the earth, shields, and soldiers
    of the opposition) if it were thrust downwards, due to its length. \n\nThe Macedonian
    phalanx was much less able to form a shield wall, but the lengthened spears would
    have compensated for this. \n\nSuch a phalanx formation also reduced the likelihood
    that battles would degenerate into a pushing match.\n\n\n== Deployment and combat
    ==\n\n=== Phalanx composition and strength ===\n\nThe basic combat element of
    the Greek armies was either the stichos (meaning 'file'; usually 8\u201316 men
    strong) or the enomotia (meaning 'sworn' and made up by 2\u20134 stich\u0153,
    totaling up to 32 men), both led by a dim\u0153rites who was assisted by a decadarchos
    and two decaster\u0153 (sing. decasteros). \n\nFour to a maximum of 32 enomoti\xE6
    (depending on the era in question or the city) were forming a lochos led by a
    lochagos, who in this way was in command of initially 100 hoplites to a maximum
    of c. 500 in the late Hellenistic armies. \n\nHere, it has to be noted that the
    military manuals of Asclepiodotus and Aelian use the term lochos to denote a
    file in the phalanx. \n\nA taxis (mora for the Spartans) was the greatest standard
    hoplitic formation of 500 to 1500 men, led by a strategos (general). \n\nThe
    entire army, a total of several taxeis or mor\xE6 was led by a generals' council.
    \n\nThe commander-in-chief was usually called a polemarchos or a strategos autocrator.\n\n\n===
    Phalanx front and depth ===\n\nHoplite phalanxes usually deployed in ranks of
    eight men or more deep; the Macedonian phalanxes were usually 16 men deep, sometimes
    reported to have been arrayed 32 men deep. \n\nThere are some notable extremes;
    at the battles of Leuctra and Mantinea, the Theban general Epaminondas arranged
    the left wing of the phalanx into a \"hammerhead\" of 50 ranks of elite hoplites
    deep (see below) and when depth was less important, phalanxes just four deep
    are recorded, as at the battle of Marathon.The phalanx depth could vary depending
    on the needs of the moment and plans of the general. \n\nWhile the phalanx was
    in march, an eis bathos formation (loose, meaning literally 'in depth') was adopted
    in order to move more freely and maintain order. \n\nThis was also the initial
    battle formation as, in addition, it permitted friendly units to pass through
    whether assaulting or retreating. \n\nIn this status, the phalanx had twice the
    normal depth and each hoplite had to occupy about 1.8\u20132 metres (5 ft 11
    in\u20136 ft 7 in) in width. \n\nWhen enemy infantry was approaching, a rapid
    switch to the pycne (spelled also pucne) formation (dense or tight formation)
    was necessary. \n\nIn that case, each man's space was halved (0.9\u20131 metre
    or 2 feet 11 inches\u20133 feet 3 inches in width) and the formation depth returned
    to normal. \n\nAn even denser formation, the synaspismos or sunaspismos (ultra-tight
    or locked shields formation), was used when the phalanx was expected to experience
    extra pressure, intense missile volleys or frontal cavalry charges. \n\nIn synaspismos,
    the rank depth was half that of a normal phalanx and the width each man occupied
    was as small as 0.45 metres (1.5 ft).\n\n\n=== Stages of combat ===\n\nSeveral
    stages in hoplite combat can be defined:\nEphodos: The hoplites stop singing
    their p\xE6anes (battle hymns) and move towards the enemy, gradually picking
    up pace and momentum. \n\nIn the instants before impact, war cries (alalagm\u0153,
    sing. alalagmos) would be made. \n\nNotable war cries were the Athenian (eleleleleu!
    eleleleleu!) and the Macedonian (alalalalai! alalalalai!) alalagm\u0153.\nKrousis:
    The opposing phalanxes meet each other almost simultaneously along their front.
    \nDoratismos: Repeated, rapid spear thrusts in order to disrupt the enemy formation.
    \n\nThe use of long spears would keep enemies apart as well as allow men in a
    row to assist their comrades next to them. \n\nThe prodding could also open up
    a man to allow a comrade to spear him. \n\nToo hard prodding could get a spear
    stuck in a shield, which would necessitate someone in the back to lend his to
    the now-disarmed man.\nOthismos: Literally 'pushing' after most spears have been
    broken, the hoplites begin to push with their spears and spear shafts against
    their opponents' shields. \n\nThis could be the longest phase.Pararrhexis: 'Breaching'
    the opposing phalanx, the enemy formation shatters and the battle ends. \n\nCavalry
    would be used at this point to mop up the scattered enemy.\n\n\n== Tactics ==\n\nThe
    early history of the phalanx is largely one of combat between hoplite armies
    from competing Greek city-states. \n\nThe usual result was rather identical,
    inflexible formations pushing against each other until one broke. \n\nThe potential
    of the phalanx to achieve something more was demonstrated at Battle of Marathon
    (490 BC). \n\nFacing the much larger army of Darius I, the Athenians thinned
    out their phalanx and consequently lengthened their front, to avoid being outflanked.
    \n\nHowever, even a reduced-depth phalanx proved unstoppable to the lightly armed
    Persian infantry. \n\nAfter routing the Persian wings, the hoplites on the Athenian
    wings wheeled inwards, destroying the elite troop at the Persian centre, resulting
    in a crushing victory for Athens. \n\nThroughout the Greco-Persian Wars the hoplite
    phalanx was to prove superior to the Persian infantry (e.g. the battles of Thermopylae
    and Plataea).\nPerhaps the most prominent example of the phalanx's evolution
    was the oblique order, made famous in the Battle of Leuctra. \n\nThere, the Theban
    general Epaminondas thinned out the right flank and centre of his phalanx, and
    deepened his left flank to an unheard-of 50 men deep. \n\nIn doing so, Epaminondas
    reversed the convention by which the right flank of the phalanx was strongest.
    \n\nThis allowed the Thebans to assault in strength the elite Spartan troops
    on the right flank of the opposing phalanx. \n\nMeanwhile, the centre and right
    flank of the Theban line were echeloned back, from the opposing phalanx, keeping
    the weakened parts of the formation from being engaged. \n\nOnce the Spartan
    right had been routed by the Theban left, the remainder of the Spartan line also
    broke. \n\nThus, by localising the attacking power of the hoplites, Epaminondas
    was able to defeat an enemy previously thought invincible.\nPhilip II of Macedon
    spent several years in Thebes as a hostage, and paid attention to Epaminondas'
    innovations. \n\nOn return to his homeland, he raised a revolutionary new infantry
    force, which was to change the face of the Greek world. \n\nPhilip's phalangites
    were the first force of professional soldiers seen in Ancient Greece apart from
    Sparta. \n\nThey were armed with longer spears (the sarissa) and were drilled
    more thoroughly in more evolved, complicated tactics and manoeuvres. \n\nMore
    importantly, though, Philip's phalanx was part of a multi-faceted, combined force
    that included a variety of skirmishers and cavalry, most notably the famous Companion
    cavalry. \n\nThe Macedonian phalanx now was used to pin the centre of the enemy
    line, while cavalry and more mobile infantry struck at the foe's flanks. \n\nIts
    supremacy over the more static armies fielded by the Greek city-states was shown
    at the Battle of Chaeronea, where Philip II's army crushed the allied Theban
    and Athenian phalanxes.\n\n\n== Weaknesses ==\n\nThe hoplite phalanx was weakest
    when facing an enemy fielding lighter and more flexible troops without its own
    such supporting troops. \n\nAn example of this would be the Battle of Lechaeum,
    where an Athenian contingent led by Iphicrates routed an entire Spartan mora
    (a unit of anywhere from 500 to 900 hoplites). \n\nThe Athenian force had a considerable
    proportion of light missile troops armed with javelins and bows that wore down
    the Spartans with repeated attacks, causing disarray in the Spartan ranks and
    an eventual rout when they spotted Athenian heavy infantry reinforcements trying
    to flank them by boat.\nThe Macedonian phalanx had weaknesses similar to its
    hoplitic predecessor. \n\nTheoretically indestructible from the front, its flanks
    and rear were very vulnerable, and once engaged it may not easily disengage or
    redeploy to face a threat from those directions. \n\nThus, a phalanx facing non-phalangite
    formations required some sort of protection on its flanks\u2014lighter or at
    least more mobile infantry, cavalry, etc. \n\nThis was shown at the Battle of
    Magnesia, where, once the Seleucid supporting cavalry elements were driven off,
    the phalanx was static and unable to go on the offensive against its Roman opponents
    (although they continued to resist stoutly and attempted a fighting withdrawal
    under a hail of Roman missiles, until the elephants posted on their flanks panicked
    and disrupted their formation).\nThe Macedonian phalanx could also lose its cohesion
    without proper coordination or while moving through broken terrain; doing so
    could create gaps between individual blocks/syntagmata, or could prevent a solid
    front within those sub-units as well, causing other sections of the line to bunch
    up. \n\nIn this event, as in the battles of Cynoscephalae and Pydna, the phalanx
    became vulnerable to attacks by more flexible units\u2014such as Roman legionary
    centuries, which were able to avoid the sarissae and engage in hand-to-hand combat
    with the phalangites.\nAnother important area that must be considered concerns
    the psychological tendencies of the hoplites. \n\nBecause the strength of a phalanx
    depended on the ability of the hoplites to maintain their frontline, it was crucial
    that a phalanx be able to quickly and efficiently replace fallen soldiers in
    the front ranks. \n\nIf a phalanx failed to do this in a structured manner, the
    opposing phalanx would have an opportunity to breach the line which, many times,
    would lead to a quick defeat. \n\nThis then implies that the hoplites ranks closer
    to the front must be mentally prepared to replace their fallen comrade and adapt
    to his new position without disrupting the structure of the frontline.Finally,
    most of the phalanx-centric armies tended to lack supporting echelons behind
    the main line of battle. \n\nThis meant that breaking through the line of battle
    or compromising one of its flanks often ensured victory.\n\n\n== Classical decline
    and post-classical use ==\n\nAfter reaching its zenith in the conquests of Alexander
    the Great, the phalanx began a slow decline, as Macedonian successor states declined.
    \n\nThe combined arms tactics used by Alexander and his father were gradually
    replaced by a return to the simpler frontal charge tactics of the hoplite phalanx.
    \n\nThe expense of the supporting arms and cavalry, and the widespread use of
    mercenaries, caused the Diadochi to rely on phalanx vs. phalanx tactics during
    the Wars of the Diadochi.\nThe decline of the Diadochi and the phalanx was linked
    with the rise of Rome and the Roman legions from the 3rd century BC. \n\nThe
    Battle of the Caudine Forks showed the clumsiness of the Roman phalanx against
    the Samnites. \n\nThe Romans had originally employed the phalanx themselves but
    gradually evolved more flexible tactics. \n\nThe result was the three-line Roman
    legion of the middle period of the Roman Republic, the Manipular System. \n\nRomans
    used a phalanx for their third military line, the triarii. \n\nThese were veteran
    reserve troops armed with the hastae or spear. \n\nRome conquered most of the
    Macedonian successor states. \n\nAlso the various Greek city-states and leagues.
    \n\nAs these states ceased to exist, so did the armies which used the traditional
    phalanx. \n\nSubsequently, troops from these regions were equipped, trained and
    fought using the Roman model.\nA phalanx formation called the phoulkon appeared
    in the late Roman army and Byzantine army. \n\nIt had characteristics of the
    classical Greek and Hellenistic phalanxes, but was more flexible. \n\nIt was
    used against cavalry more than infantry.\nHowever, the phalanx did not totally
    disappear. \n\nIn some battles between the Roman army and Hellenistic phalanxes,
    such as Pydna (168 BC), Cynoscephalae (197 BC) and Magnesia (190 BC), the phalanx
    performed well. \n\nIt even drove back the Roman infantry. \n\nHowever, at Cynoscephalae
    and Magnesia, failure to defend the flanks of the phalanx led to defeat. \n\nAt
    Pydna, the phalanx lost cohesion when pursuing retreating Roman soldiers. \n\nThis
    allowed the Romans to penetrate the formation. \n\nThen, Roman close combat skills
    proved decisive. \n\nThe historian Polybius details the effectiveness of the
    Roman legion against the phalanx. \n\nHe deduces that the Romans refused to fight
    the phalanx where the phalanx was effective, Romans offered battle only when
    a legion could exploit the clumsiness and immobility of a phalanx.\n\nSpear-armed
    troops continued to be important elements in many armies until reliable firearms
    became available. \n\nThese did not necessarily fight as a phalanx. \n\nFor example,
    compare the classical phalanx and late medieval pike formations.Military historians
    have suggested that the Scots under William Wallace and Robert the Bruce consciously
    imitated the Hellenistic phalanx to produce the Scots 'hedgehog' or schiltron.
    \n\nHowever, long spears might have been used by Picts and others in Scotlands'
    Early Middle Ages. \n\nPrior to 1066, long spear tactics (also found in North
    Wales) might have been part of irregular warfare in Britain. \n\nThe Scots used
    imported French pikes and dynamic tactics at the Battle of Flodden. \n\nHowever,
    Flodden found the Scots pitted against effective light artillery, while advancing
    over bad ground. \n\nThe combination disorganised the Scotts phalanxes and permitted
    effective attacks by English longbowmen, and soldiers wielding shorter, handier
    polearms called bills. \n\nSome contemporary sources might say that the bills
    cut off the heads of Scots pikes.\nThe pike was briefly reconsidered as a weapon
    by European armies in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. \n\nIt could protect
    riflemen, whose slower rate of fire made them vulnerable. \n\nA collapsible pike
    was invented but never issued. \n\nThe Confederate Army considered these for
    the American Civil War. \n\nSome were even manufactured but probably were never
    issued. \n\nPikes were manufactured during World War II as \"Croft's Pikes\".\nWhile
    obsolete in military practice, the phalanx remained in use as a metaphor of warriors
    moving forward as a single united block. \n\nThis metaphor inspired several 20th-century
    political movements, notably the Spanish Falange and its ideology of Falangism.\nThe
    Byzantines continued and improved the use of the classical Greek phalanx alongside
    the Macedonian-style phalanx. \n\nThe latter was based on a model that Alexander
    himself had created and had tried to give more importance to the skirmishers
    and cavalry, yet it never saw action until the Byzantines adopted the model that
    rely in a mixture of many units sometimes. \n\nMany writers of the age describe
    the spear as being a sarissa yet it was a meter short than the original sarissa
    and had being modified by the time, yet the term for the long spear remained
    alongside with its other names.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phalanx"

  descriptionText: "\n\nOCCIPITAL BONE\n\n\nThe occipital bone () is a cranial dermal
    bone and the main bone of the occiput (back and lower part of the skull). \n\nIt
    is trapezoidal in shape and curved on itself like a shallow dish. \n\nThe occipital
    bone overlies the occipital lobes of the cerebrum. \n\nAt the base of skull in
    the occipital bone, there is a large oval opening called the foramen magnum,
    which allows the passage of the spinal cord.\nLike the other cranial bones, it
    is classed as a flat bone. \n\nDue to its many attachments and features, the
    occipital bone is described in terms of separate parts. \n\nFrom its front to
    the back is the basilar part, also called the basioccipital, at the sides of
    the foramen magnum are the lateral parts, also called the exoccipitals, and the
    back is named as the squamous part. \n\nThe basilar part is a thick, somewhat
    quadrilateral piece in front of the foramen magnum and directed towards the pharynx.
    \n\nThe squamous part is the curved, expanded plate behind the foramen magnum
    and is the largest part of the occipital bone.\nDue to its embryonic derivation
    from paraxial mesoderm (as opposed to neural crest, from which many other craniofacial
    bones are derived), it has been posited that \"the occipital bone as a whole
    could be considered as a giant vertebra enlarged to support the brain.\"\n\n\n==
    Structure ==\n\nThe occipital bone, like the other seven cranial bones, has outer
    and inner layers (also called plates or tables) of cortical bone tissue between
    which is the cancellous bone tissue known in the cranial bones as diplo\xEB.
    \n\nThe bone is especially thick at the ridges, protuberances, condyles, and
    anterior part of the basilar part; in the inferior cerebellar fossae it is thin,
    semitransparent, and without diplo\xEB.\n\n\n=== Outer surface ===\n\n\nNear
    the middle of the outer surface of the squamous part of the occipital (the largest
    part) there is a prominence \u2013 the external occipital protuberance. \n\nThe
    highest point of this is called the inion.\nFrom the inion, along the midline
    of the squamous part until the foramen magnum, runs a ridge \u2013 the external
    occipital crest (also called the medial nuchal line) and this gives attachment
    to the nuchal ligament.\nRunning across the outside of the occipital bone are
    three curved lines and one line (the medial line) that runs down to the foramen
    magnum. \n\nThese are known as the nuchal lines which give attachment to various
    ligaments and muscles. \n\nThey are named as the highest, superior and inferior
    nuchal lines. \n\nThe inferior nuchal line runs across the midpoint of the median
    nuchal line. \n\nThe area above the highest nuchal line is termed the occipital
    plane and the area below this line is termed the nuchal plane.\n\n\n=== Inner
    surface ===\n\n\nThe inner surface of the occipital bone forms the base of the
    posterior cranial fossa. \n\nThe foramen magnum is a large hole situated in the
    middle, with the clivus, a smooth part of the occipital bone travelling upwards
    in front of it. \n\nThe median internal occipital crest travels behind it to
    the internal occipital protuberance, and serves as a point of attachment to the
    falx cerebri.\nTo the sides of the foramen sitting at the junction between the
    lateral and base of the occipital bone are the hypoglossal canals. \n\nFurther
    out, at each junction between the occipital and petrous portion of the temporal
    bone lies a jugular foramen.The inner surface of the occipital bone is marked
    by dividing lines as shallow ridges, that form four fossae or depressions. \n\nThe
    lines are called the cruciform (cross-shaped) eminence.\nAt the midpoint where
    the lines intersect a raised part is formed called the internal occipital protuberance.
    \n\nFrom each side of this eminence runs a groove for the transverse sinuses.\nThere
    are two midline skull landmarks at the foramen magnum. \n\nThe basion is the
    most anterior point of the opening and the opisthion is the point on the opposite
    posterior part. \n\nThe basion lines up with the dens.\n\n\n=== Foramen magnum
    ===\n\n\nThe foramen magnum (Latin: large hole) is a large oval foramen longest
    front to back; it is wider behind than in front where it is encroached upon by
    the occipital condyles. \n\nThe clivus, a smooth bony section, travels upwards
    on the front surface of the foramen, and the median internal occipital crest
    travels behind it.Through the foramen passes the medulla oblongata and its membranes,
    the accessory nerves, the vertebral arteries, the anterior and posterior spinal
    arteries, and the tectorial membrane and alar ligaments.\n\n\n=== Angles ===\n\nThe
    superior angle of the occipital bone articulates with the occipital angles of
    the parietal bones and, in the fetal skull, corresponds in position with the
    posterior fontanelle.\nThe lateral angles are situated at the extremities of
    the groove for the transverse sinuses: each is received into the interval between
    the mastoid angle of the parietal bone, and the mastoid portion of the temporal
    bone.\nThe inferior angle is fused with the body of the sphenoid bone.\n\n\n===
    Borders ===\n\nThe superior borders extend from the superior to the lateral angles:
    they are deeply serrated for articulation with the occipital borders of the parietals,
    and form by this union the lambdoidal suture.\nThe inferior borders extend from
    the lateral angles to the inferior angle; the upper half of each articulates
    with the mastoid portion of the corresponding temporal, the lower half with the
    petrous part of the same bone.\nThese two portions of the inferior border are
    separated from one another by the jugular process, the notch on the anterior
    surface of which forms the posterior part of the jugular foramen.\n\n\n=== Sutures
    ===\n\n\n\t\t\nThe lambdoid suture joins the occipital bone to the parietal bones.\nThe
    occipitomastoid suture joins the occipital bone and mastoid portion of the temporal
    bone.\n\nThe sphenobasilar suture joins the basilar part of the occipital bone
    and the back of the sphenoid bone body .\nThe petrous-basilar suture joins the
    side edge of the basilar part of the occipital bone to the petrous-part of the
    temporal bone .\n\n\n== Development ==\n\n\nThe occipital plane of the squamous
    part of the occipital bone is developed in membrane, and may remain separate
    throughout life when it constitutes the interparietal bone; the rest of the bone
    is developed in cartilage.\nThe number of nuclei for the occipital plane is usually
    given as four, two appearing near the middle line about the second month, and
    two some little distance from the middle line about the third month of fetal
    life.\nThe nuchal plane of the squamous part is ossified from two centers, which
    appear about the seventh week of fetal life and soon unite to form a single piece.\nUnion
    of the upper and lower portions of the squamous part takes place in the third
    month of fetal life.\nAn occasional centre (Kerckring) appears in the posterior
    margin of the foramen magnum during the fifth month; this forms a separate ossicle
    (sometimes double) which unites with the rest of the squamous part before birth.\nEach
    of the lateral parts begins to ossify from a single center during the eighth
    week of fetal life. \n\nThe basilar portion is ossified from two centers, one
    in front of the other; these appear about the sixth week of fetal life and rapidly
    coalesce.\nThe occipital plane is said to be ossified from two centers and the
    basilar portion from one.\nAbout the fourth year the squamous part and the two
    lateral parts unite, and by about the sixth year the bone consists of a single
    piece. \n\nBetween the 18th and 25th years the occipital and sphenoid bone become
    united, forming a single bone.\n\n\n== Clinical significance ==\n\nTrauma to
    the occiput can cause a fracture of the base of the skull, called a basilar skull
    fracture. \n\nThe basion-dens line as seen on a radiograph is the distance between
    the basion and the top of the dens, used in the diagnosis of dissociation injuries.Genetic
    disorders can cause a prominent occiput as found in Edwards syndrome, and Beckwith\u2013Wiedemann
    syndrome.\nThe identification of the location of the fetal occiput is important
    in delivery.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nOccipital stems from Latin occiput \"back
    of the skull\", from ob \"against, behind\" + caput \"head\". \n\nDistinguished
    from sinciput (anterior part of the skull).\n\n\n== Other animals ==\n\nIn many
    animals these parts stay separate throughout life; for example, in the dog as
    four parts: squamous part (supraoccipital); lateral parts\u2013left and right
    parts (exoccipital); basilar part (basioccipital).\nThe occipital bone is part
    of the endocranium, the most basal portion of the skull. \n\nIn Chondrichthyes
    and Agnatha, the occipital does not form as a separate element, but remains part
    of the chondrocranium throughout life. \n\nIn most higher vertebrates, the foramen
    magnum is surrounded by a ring of four bones.\nThe basioccipital lies in front
    of the opening, the two exoccipital condyles lie to either side, and the larger
    supraoccipital lies to the posterior, and forms at least part of the rear of
    the cranium. \n\nIn many bony fish and amphibians, the supraoccipital is never
    ossified, and remains as cartilage throughout life. \n\nIn primitive forms the
    basioccipital and exoccipitals somewhat resemble the centrum and neural arches
    of a vertebra, and form in a similar manner in the embryo. \n\nTogether, these
    latter bones usually form a single concave circular condyle for the articulation
    of the first vertebra.In mammals, however, the condyle has divided in two, a
    pattern otherwise seen only in a few amphibians.\nMost mammals also have a single
    fused occipital bone, formed from the four separate elements around the foramen
    magnum, along with the paired postparietal bones that form the rear of the cranial
    roof in other vertebrates.\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occipital_bone"

  descriptionText: "\n\nPREMOLAR\n\n\nThe premolars, also called premolar teeth,
    or bicuspids, are transitional teeth located between the canine and molar teeth.
    \n\nIn humans, there are two premolars per quadrant in the permanent set of teeth,
    making eight premolars total in the mouth. \n\nThey have at least two cusps.
    \n\nPremolars can be considered transitional teeth during chewing, or mastication.
    \n\nThey have properties of both the canines, that lay anterior and molars that
    lay posterior, and so food can be transferred from the canines to the premolars
    and finally to the molars for grinding, instead of directly from the canines
    to the molars.\n\n\n== Human anatomy ==\n\nThe premolars in humans are the maxillary
    first premolar, maxillary second premolar, mandibular first premolar, and the
    mandibular second premolar. \n\nPremolar teeth by definition are permanent teeth
    distal to the canines, preceded by deciduous molars.\n\n\n=== Morphology ===\n\nThere
    is always one large buccal cusp, especially so in the mandibular first premolar.
    \n\nThe lower second premolar almost always presents with two lingual cusps.The
    lower premolars and the upper second premolar usually have one root. \n\nThe
    upper first usually has two roots, but can have just one root, notably in Sinodonts,
    and can sometimes have three roots.Premolars are unique to the permanent dentition.
    \n\nPremolars are referred to as bicuspid (has two main cusps), a buccal and
    a palatal/lingual cusp which are separated by a mesiodistal occlusal fissure.\nThe
    maxillary premolars are trapezoidal in shape. \n\nWhilst the mandibular premolars
    are rhomboidal in shape.\n\n\n==== Maxillary first premolar ====\nThe crown of
    the tooth appears ovoid, wider buccally than palatally\nFrom a buccal view, the
    first premolar is similar to the adjacent canine\nRoots: Two roots buccal and
    palatal. \n\nSometimes (40%) there is only one root.\n\n\n==== Maxillary second
    premolar ====\nSimilar to maxillary first premolar but the mesio-buccal and disto-buccal
    corners are rounder\nThe two cusps are smaller and more equal in size\nShorter
    occlusal fissure\nUsually one root\n\n\n==== Mandibular first premolar ====\n\n-The
    smallest premolar out of all four\n-Dominant buccal cusp and a very small lingual
    cusp\n-The buccal cusp is broad and the lingual cusp is less than half the size
    of the buccal cusp.\n-Two-thirds of the buccal surface can be seen from the occlusal
    aspect\n-A single conical root with an oval/round cross section. \n-The root
    is grooved longitudinally both mesially and distally.\n\n\n==== Mandibular second
    premolar ====\n\nThe crown is larger than the mandibular first premolar\nLingual
    cusp is smaller than the buccal cusp but better developed.\n\nThe lingual and
    buccal cusp is separated by a well defined mesiodistal occlusal fissure\n\nThe
    lingual cusp is divided into two; the mesiolingual and distolingual cusps with
    the mesiolingual cusp being higher and wider than the distolingual.\n\nRoot:
    Single conical root, oval/round in cross section.\n\n\n== Orthodontics ==\n\nThe
    four first premolars are the most commonly removed teeth, in 48.8% of cases,
    when teeth are removed for orthodontic treatment (which is in 45.8% of orthodontic
    patients). \n\nThe removal of only the maxillary first premolars is the second
    likeliest option, in 14.5% of cases.\n\n\n== Other mammals ==\n\nIn primitive
    placental mammals there are four premolars per quadrant, but the most mesial
    two (closer to the front of the mouth) have been lost in catarrhines (Old World
    monkeys and apes, including humans). \n\nPaleontologists therefore refer to human
    premolars as Pm3 and Pm4.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premolar"

    is composed of three parts: the ilium, ischium, and the pubis.\n\nThe two hip
    bones join at the pubic symphysis and together with the sacrum and coccyx (the
    pelvic part of the spine) comprise the skeletal component of the pelvis \u2013
    the pelvic girdle which surrounds the pelvic cavity. \n\nThey are connected to
    the sacrum, which is part of the axial skeleton, at the sacroiliac joint. Each
    hip bone is connected to the corresponding femur (thigh bone) (forming the primary
    connection between the bones of the lower limb and the axial skeleton) through
    the large ball and socket joint of the hip.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe hip bone
    is formed by three parts: the ilium, ischium, and pubis. \n\nAt birth, these
    three components are separated by hyaline cartilage. \n\nThey join each other
    in a Y-shaped portion of cartilage in the acetabulum. \n\nBy the end of puberty
    the three regions will have fused together, and by the age 25 they will have
    ossified.\n\nThe two hip bones join each other at the pubic symphysis. Together
    with the sacrum and coccyx, the hip bones form the pelvis.\n\n\n=== Ilium ===\n\nIlium
    (plural ilia) is the uppermost and largest region. It makes up two fifths of
    the acetabulum. \n\nIt is divisible into two parts: the body and the ala or wing
    of ilium; the separation is indicated on the top surface by a curved line, the
    arcuate line, and on the external surface by the margin of the acetabulum. \n\nThe
    body of ilium forms the sacroiliac joint with the sacrum. \n\nThe edge of the
    wing of ilium forms the S-shaped iliac crest which is easily located through
    the skin. \n\nThe iliac crest shows clear marks of the attachment of the three
    abdominal wall muscles.\n\n\n=== Ischium ===\n\nThe ischium forms the lower and
    back part of the hip bone and is located below the ilium and behind the pubis.
    \n\nThe ischium is the strongest of the three regions that form the hip bone.
    \n\nIt is divisible into three portions: the body, the superior ramus, and the
    inferior ramus. \n\nThe body forms approximately one-third of the acetabulum.\n\nThe
    ischium forms a large swelling, the tuberosity of the ischium, also referred
    to colloquially as the \"sit bone\". \n\nWhen sitting, the weight is frequently
    placed upon the ischial tuberosity. \n\nThe gluteus maximus covers it in the
    upright posture, but leaves it free in the seated position.\n\n\n=== Pubis ===\n\nThe
    pubic region or pubis is the ventral and anterior of the three parts forming
    the hip bone. \n\nIt is divisible into a body, a superior ramus, and an inferior
    ramus. \n\nThe body forms one-fifth of the acetabulum. \n\nThe body forms the
    wide, strong, medial and flat portion of the pubic bone which unites with the
    other pubic bone in the pubic symphysis. \n\nThe fibrocartilaginous pad which
    lies between the symphysial surfaces of the coxal bones, that secures the pubic
    symphysis, is called the interpubic disc.\n\n\n=== Pelvic brim ===\n\nThe pelvic
    brim is a continuous oval ridge of bone that runs along the pubic symphysis,
    pubic crests, arcuate lines, sacral alae, and sacral promontory.\n\n\n=== False
    pelvis, pelvic inlet, and ramus ===\n\nThe false pelvis is that portion superior
    to the pelvic brim; it is bounded by the alae of the ilia laterally and the sacral
    promontory and lumbar vertebrae posteriorly.\n\nThe true pelvis is the region
    inferior to the pelvic brim that is almost entirely surrounded by bone.\n\nThe
    pelvic inlet is the opening delineated by the pelvic brim. \n\nThe widest dimension
    of the pelvic inlet is from left to right, that is, along the frontal plane.
    \n\nThe pelvic outlet is the margin of the true pelvis. \n\nIt is bounded anteriorly
    by the pubic arch, laterally by the ischia, and posteriorly by the sacrum and
    coccyx.\n\nThe superior pubic ramus is a part of the pubic bone which forms a
    portion of the obturator foramen. \n\nIt extends from the body to the median
    plane where it articulates with its fellow of the opposite side. \n\nIt is conveniently
    described in two portions: a medial flattened part and a narrow lateral prismoid
    portion. \n\nThe inferior pubic ramus is thin and flat. \n\nIt passes laterally
    and downward from the medial end of the superior ramus. \n\nIt becomes narrower
    as it descends and joins with the inferior ramus of the ischium below the obturator
    foramen.\n\n\n== Development and sexual dimorphism ==\n\nThe hip bone is ossified
    from eight centers: three primary, one each for the ilium, ischium, and pubis,
    and five secondary, one each for the iliac crest, the anterior inferior spine
    (said to occur more frequently in the male than in the female), the tuberosity
    of the ischium, the pubic symphysis (more frequent in the female than in the
    male), and one or more for the Y-shaped piece at the bottom of the acetabulum.\n\nThe
    centers appear in the following order: in the lower part of the ilium, immediately
    above the greater sciatic notch, about the eighth or ninth week of fetal life;
    in the superior ramus of the ischium, about the third month; in the superior
    ramus of the pubis, between the fourth and fifth months. \n\nAt birth, the three
    primary centers are quite separate, the crest, the bottom of the acetabulum,
    the ischial tuberosity, and the inferior rami of the ischium and pubis being
    still cartilaginous.\n\nBy the seventh or eighth year, the inferior rami of the
    pubis and ischium are almost completely united by bone. \n\nAbout the thirteenth
    or fourteenth year, the three primary centers have extended their growth into
    the bottom of the acetabulum, and are there separated from each other by a Y-shaped
    portion of cartilage, which now presents traces of ossification, often by two
    or more centers. \n\nOne of these, the os acetabuli, appears about the age of
    twelve, between the ilium and pubis, and fuses with them about the age of eighteen;
    it forms the pubic part of the acetabulum. \n\nThe ilium and ischium then become
    joined, and lastly the pubis and ischium, through the intervention of this Y-shaped
    portion.\n\nAt about the age of puberty, ossification takes place in each of
    the remaining portions, and they join with the rest of the bone between the twentieth
    and twenty-fifth years. \n\nSeparate centers are frequently found for the pubic
    tubercle and the ischial spine, and for the crest and angle of the pubis. \n\nThe
    proportions of the female hip bone may affect the ease of passage of the baby
    during childbirth.\n\n\n== Muscle attachments ==\n\nSeveral muscles attach to
    the hip bone including the internal muscles of the pelvic, abdominal muscles,
    back muscles, all the gluteal muscles, muscles of the lateral rotator group,
    hamstring muscles, two muscles from the anterior compartment of the thigh.\n\n\n===
    Abdominal muscles ===\n\nThe abdominal external oblique muscle attaches to the
    iliac crest.\n\nThe abdominal internal oblique muscle attaches to pecten pubis.\n\nThe
    transversus abdominis muscle attaches to the pubic crest and pecten pubis via
    a conjoint tendon\n\n\n=== Back muscles ===\n\nThe multifidus muscle in the sacral
    region attaches to the medial surface of posterior superior iliac spine, the
    posterior sacroiliac ligaments and several places to the sacrum.\n\n\n=== Gluteal
    muscles ===\n\nThe gluteus maximus muscle arises from the posterior gluteal line
    of the inner upper ilium, and the rough portion of bone including the iliac crest,
    the fascia covering the gluteus medius (gluteal aponeurosis), as well as the
    sacrum, coccyx, the erector spinae (lumbodorsal fascia), the sacrotuberous ligament.\n\nThe
    gluteus medius muscle: originates on the outer surface of the ilium between the
    iliac crest and the posterior gluteal line above, and the anterior gluteal line
    below. \n\nThe gluteus medius also originates from the gluteal aponeurosis that
    covers its outer surface.\n\nGluteus minimus muscle originates between the anterior
    and inferior gluteal lines, and from the margin of the greater sciatic notch.\n\n\n===
    Lateral rotator group ===\n\nThe piriformis muscle originates from the superior
    margin of the greater sciatic notch (as well as the sacroiliac joint capsule
    and the sacrotuberous ligament and  part of the spine and sacrum.\n\nThe superior
    gemellus muscle arises from the outer surface of the ischial spine.\n\n\nThe
    obturator internus muscle arises from the inner surface of the antero-lateral
    wall of the hip bone, where it surrounds the greater part of the obturator foramen,
    being attached to the inferior rami of the pubis and ischium, and at the side
    to the inner surface of the hip bone below and behind the pelvic brim, reaching
    from the upper part of the greater sciatic foramen above and behind to the obturator
    foramen below and in front. \n\nIt also arises from the pelvic surface of the
    obturator membrane except in the posterior part, from the tendinous arch, and
    to a slight extent from the obturator fascia, which covers the muscle.\n\nThe
    inferior gemellus muscle arises from the upper part of the tuberosity of the
    ischium, immediately below the groove for the obturator internus tendon.\n\nThe
    obturator externus muscle arises from the margin of bone immediately around the
    medial side of the obturator foramen, from the rami of the pubis, and the inferior
    ramus of the ischium; it also arises from the medial two-thirds of the outer
    surface of the obturator membrane, and from the tendinous arch.\n\n\n=== Hamstrings
    ===\n\n-The long head biceps femoris arises from the lower and inner impression
    on the back part of the tuberosity of the ischium, by a tendon common to it and
    the semitendinosus, and from the lower part of the sacrotuberous ligament;\n\n-The
    semitendinosus arises from the lower and medial impression on the tuberosity
    of the ischium, by a tendon common to it and the long head of the biceps femoris;
    it also arises from an aponeurosis which connects the adjacent surfaces of the
    two muscles to the extent of about 7.5 cm. from their origin.\n\n-The semimembranosus
    arises from the lower and medial impression on the tuberosity of the ischium\n\n\n===
    Anterior compartment of thigh ===\n\n-The rectus femoris muscle arises by two
    tendons: one, the anterior or straight, from the anterior inferior iliac spine;
    the other, the posterior or reflected, from a groove above the rim of the acetabulum.\n\n-The
    sartorius muscle arises by tendinous fibres from the anterior superior iliac
    spine,\n\n\n=== Shoulder muscles ===\n\nThe latissimus dorsi muscle attaches
    to the iliac crest and several places on the spine and ribs.\n\n\n== Clinical
    significance ==\n\n\n=== Fractures ===\n\nFractures of the hip bone are termed
    pelvic fractures, and should not be confused with hip fractures, which are actually
    femoral fractures that occur in the proximal end of the femur.\n\n\n=== Preparation
    for childbirth ===\n\nPelvimetry is the assessment of the female pelvis in relation
    to the birth of a baby in order to detect an increased risk for obstructed labor.\n\n\n==
    Evolution of the pelvis in animals ==\n\nThe hip bone first appears in fishes,
    where it consists of a simple, usually triangular bone, to which the pelvic fin
    articulates. \n\nThe hip bones on each side usually connect with each other at
    the forward end, and are even solidly fused in lungfishes and sharks, but they
    never attach to the vertebral column.\n\nIn the early tetrapods, this early hip
    bone evolved to become the ischium and pubis, while the ilium formed as a new
    structure, initially somewhat rod-like in form, but soon adding a larger bony
    blade. The acetabulum is already present at the point where the three bones meet.
    \n\nIn these early forms, the connection with the vertebral column is not complete,
    with a small pair of ribs connecting the two structures; nonetheless the pelvis
    already forms the complete ring found in most subsequent forms.\n\nIn practice,
    modern amphibians and reptiles have substantially modified this ancestral structure,
    based on their varied forms and lifestyles. \n\nThe obturator foramen is generally
    very small in such animals, although most reptiles do possess a large gap between
    the pubis and ischium, referred to as the thyroid fenestra, which presents a
    similar appearance to the obturator foramen in mammals. \n\nIn birds, the pubic
    symphysis is present only in the ostrich, and the two hip bones are usually widely
    separated, making it easier to lay large eggs.In therapsids, the hip bone came
    to rotate counter-clockwise, relative to its position in reptiles, so that the
    ilium moved forward, and the pubis and ischium moved to the rear. \n\nThe same
    pattern is seen in all modern mammals, and the thyroid fenestra and obturator
    foramen have merged to form a single space. \n\nThe ilium is typically narrow
    and triangular in mammals, but is much larger in ungulates and humans, in which
    it anchors powerful gluteal muscles. \n\nMonotremes and marsupials also possess
    a fourth pair of bones, the prepubes or \"marsupial bones\", which extend forward
    from the pubes, and help to support the abdominal muscles and, in marsupials,
    the pouch. \n\nIn placental mammals, the pelvis as a whole is generally wider
    in females than in males, to allow for the birth of the young.\n\nThe pelvic
    bones of cetaceans were formerly considered to be vestigial, but they are now
    known to play a role in sexual selection.\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_bone"

  descriptionText: "\n\nFIFTH RIB\n\n\n== Structure of the rib cage ==\n\nRibs are
    described based on their location and connection with the sternum. \n\nAll ribs
    are attached posteriorly to the thoracic vertebrae and are numbered accordingly
    one to twelve. \n\nRibs that articulate directly with the sternum are called
    true ribs, whereas those that do not articulate directly are termed false ribs.
    \n\n\n=== Attachment of the rib cage ===\n\nThe terms true ribs and false ribs
    describe rib pairs that are directly or indirectly attached to the sternum. \n\nThe
    first seven rib pairs known as the fixed or vertebrosternal ribs are the true
    ribs (Latin: costae verae) as they connect directly to the sternum; the next
    five pairs (eighth to twelfth) are the false ribs (Latin: costae spuriae). \n\n\n===
    Parts of rib (general) ===\n\nEach rib consists of a head, neck, and a shaft.
    \n\nAll ribs are attached posteriorly to the thoracic vertebrae. \n\nThey are
    numbered to match the vertebrae they attach to \u2013 one to twelve, from top
    (T1) to bottom. \n\nThe head of the rib is the end part closest to the vertebra
    with which it articulates. \n\nIt is marked by a kidney-shaped articular surface
    which is divided by a horizontal crest into two articulating regions. \n\nThe
    upper region articulates with the inferior costal facet on the vertebra above,
    and the larger region articulates with the superior costal facet on the vertebra
    with the same number. \n\nThe transverse process of a thoracic vertebra also
    articulates at the transverse costal facet with the tubercle of the rib of the
    same number. \n\nThe crest gives attachment to the intra-articular ligament.The
    neck of the rib is the flattened part that extends laterally from the head. \n\nThe
    neck is about 3 cm long. \n\nIts anterior surface is flat and smooth, whilst
    its posterior is perforated by numerous foramina and its surface rough, to give
    attachment to the ligament of the neck. \n\nIts upper border presents a rough
    crest (crista colli costae) for the attachment of the anterior costotransverse
    ligament; its lower border is rounded.\n\nOn the posterior surface at the neck,
    is an eminence\u2014the tubercle that consists of an articular and a non-articular
    portion. \n\nThe articular portion is the lower and more medial of the two and
    presents a small, oval surface for articulation with the transverse costal facet
    on the end of the transverse process of the lower of the two vertebrae to which
    the head is connected. \n\nThe non-articular portion is a rough elevation and
    affords attachment to the ligament of the tubercle. \n\nThe tubercle is much
    more prominent in the upper ribs than in the lower ribs.\n\nThe angle of a rib
    (costal angle) may both refer to the bending part of it, and a prominent line
    in this area, a little in front of the tubercle. \n\nThis line is directed downward
    and laterally; this gives attachment to a tendon of the iliocostalis muscle.
    \n\nAt this point, the rib is bent in two directions, and at the same time twisted
    on its long axis.\n\nThe distance between the angle and the tubercle is progressively
    greater from the second to the tenth ribs. \n\nThe area between the angle and
    the tubercle is rounded, rough, and irregular, and serves for the attachment
    of the longissimus dorsi muscle.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rib_cage"

  descriptionText: "\n\nCUBOID BONE\n\n\nIn the human body, the cuboid bone is one
    of the seven tarsal bones of the foot.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe cuboid bone
    is the most lateral of the bones in the distal row of the tarsus. \n\nIt is roughly
    cubical in shape, and presents a prominence in its inferior (or plantar) surface,
    the tuberosity of the cuboid. \n\nThe bone provides a groove where the tendon
    of the peroneus longus muscle passes to reach its insertion in the first metatarsal
    and medial cuneiform bones.\n\n\n=== Surfaces ===\n\nThe dorsal surface, directed
    upward and lateralward, is rough, for the attachment of ligaments.\n\nThe plantar
    surface presents in front a deep groove, the peroneal sulcus, which runs obliquely
    forward and medialward; it lodges the tendon of the peroneus longus, and is bounded
    behind by a prominent ridge, to which the long plantar ligament is attached.\n\nThe
    ridge ends laterally in an eminence, the tuberosity, the surface of which presents
    an oval facet; on this facet glides the sesamoid bone or cartilage frequently
    found in the tendon of the peroneus longus. \n\nThe surface of bone behind the
    groove is rough, for the attachment of the plantar calcaneocuboid ligament, a
    few fibers of the flexor hallucis brevis, and a fasciculus from the tendon of
    the tibialis posterior.\n\nThe lateral surface presents a deep notch formed by
    the commencement of the peroneal sulcus.\n\nThe posterior surface is smooth,
    triangular, and concavo-convex, for articulation with the anterior surface of
    the calcaneus (the calcaneocuboid joint); its infero-medial angle projects backward
    as a process which underlies and supports the anterior end of the calcaneus.\n\nThe
    anterior surface, of smaller size, but also irregularly triangular, is divided
    by a vertical ridge into two facets, forming the fourth and fifth tarsometatarsal
    joints: the medial facet, quadrilateral in form, articulates with the fourth
    metatarsal; the lateral, larger and more triangular, articulates with the fifth.\n\nThe
    medial surface is broad, irregularly quadrilateral, and presents at its middle
    and upper part a smooth oval facet, for articulation with the third cuneiform;
    and behind this (occasionally) a smaller facet, for articulation with the navicular
    bone; it is rough in the rest of its extent, for the attachment of strong interosseous
    ligaments.\n\n\n=== Muscle attachments ===\n\nOnly one muscle is attached to
    the cuboid bone; the tibialis posterior. \n\nThe tibialis posterior inserts to
    the under surface of the cuboid bone. \n\nWhile the flexor hallucis brevis arises,
    by a pointed tendinous process, from the medial part of the under surface of
    the cuboid bone, from the contiguous portion of the lateral cuneiform bone, and
    from the prolongation of the tendon of the tibialis posterior.\n\n\n== Clinical
    significance ==\n\nIn a condition known as cuboid syndrome, the cuboid can be
    subluxated downward causing a swollen kind of ache along the central portion
    of the lateral border of the foot.\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuboid_bone"

  descriptionText: "\n\nMETACARPAL BONES\n\n\nIn human anatomy, the metacarpal bones
    or metacarpus, form the intermediate part of the skeletal hand located between
    the phalanges of the fingers and the carpal bones of the wrist which forms the
    connection to the forearm. \n\nThe metacarpal bones are analogous to the metatarsal
    bones in the foot.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\n\nThe metacarpals form a transverse
    arch to which the rigid row of distal carpal bones are fixed. \n\nThe peripheral
    metacarpals (those of the thumb and little finger) form the sides of the cup
    of the palmar gutter and as they are brought together they deepen this concavity.
    \n\nThe index metacarpal is the most firmly fixed, while the thumb metacarpal
    articulates with the trapezium and acts independently from the others. \n\nThe
    middle metacarpals are tightly united to the carpus by intrinsic interlocking
    bone elements at their bases. \n\nThe ring metacarpal is somewhat more mobile
    while the fifth metacarpal is semi-independent.Each metacarpal bone consists
    of a body or shaft, and two extremities: the head at the distal or digital end
    (near the fingers), and the base at the proximal or carpal end (close to the
    wrist).\n\n\n=== Body ===\n\nThe body (shaft) is prismoid in form, and curved,
    so as to be convex in the longitudinal direction behind, concave in front. \n\nIt
    presents three surfaces: medial, lateral, and dorsal.\n\nThe medial and lateral
    surfaces are concave, for the attachment of the interosseus muscles, and separated
    from one another by a prominent anterior ridge.\n\nThe dorsal surface presents
    in its distal two-thirds a smooth, triangular, flattened area which is covered
    in by the tendons of the extensor muscles. \n\nThis surface is bounded by two
    lines, which commence in small tubercles situated on either side of the digital
    extremity, and, passing upward, converge and meet some distance above the center
    of the bone and form a ridge which runs along the rest of the dorsal surface
    to the carpal extremity. \n\nThis ridge separates two sloping surfaces for the
    attachment of the interossei dorsales.\n\nTo the tubercles on the digital extremities
    are attached the collateral ligaments of the metacarpophalangeal joints.\n\n\n===
    Base ===\n\nThe base (basis) or carpal extremity is of a cuboidal form, and broader
    behind than in front: it articulates with the carpal bones and with the adjoining
    metacarpal bones; its dorsal and volar surfaces are rough, for the attachment
    of ligaments.\n\n\n=== Head ===\n\nThe head (caput) or digital extremity presents
    an oblong surface markedly convex from before backward, less so transversely,
    and flattened from side to side; it articulates with the proximal phalanx. \n\nIt
    is broader, and extends farther upward, on the volar than on the dorsal aspect,
    and is longer in the antero-posterior than in the transverse diameter. \n\nOn
    either side of the head is a tubercle for the attachment of the collateral ligament
    of the metacarpophalangeal joint.\n\nThe dorsal surface, broad and flat, supports
    the tendons of the extensor muscles.\n\nThe volar surface is grooved in the middle
    line for the passage of the flexor tendons, and marked on either side by an articular
    eminence continuous with the terminal articular surface.\n\n\n=== Neck ===\n\nThe
    neck, or subcapital segment, is the transition zone between the body and the
    head.\n\n\n=== Articulations ===\n\nBesides the metacarpophalangeal joints, the
    metacarpal bones articulate by carpometacarpal joints as follows:\n\n-the first
    with the trapezium;\n-the second with the trapezium, trapezoid, capitate and
    third metacarpal;\n-the third with the capitate and second and fourth metacarpals;\n-the
    fourth with the capitate, hamate, and third and fifth metacarpals;\n-and the
    fifth with the hamate and fourth metacarpal;\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Insertions ===\n\n-Extensor
    Carpi Radialis Longus/Brevis: Both insert on the base of metacarpal II; Assist
    with wrist extension and radial flexion of the wrist\n-Extensor Carpi Ulnaris:
    Inserts on the base of metacarpal V; Extends and fixes wrist when digits are
    being flexed; assists with ulnar flexion of wrist\n-Abductor Pollicis Longus:
    Inserts on the trapezium and base of metacarpal I; Abducts thumb in frontal plane;
    extends thumb at carpometacarpal joint\n-Opponens Pollicis: Inserts on metacarpal
    I; flexes metacarpal I to oppose the thumb to the fingertips\n-Opponens digiti
    minimi: Inserts on the medial surface of metacarpal V; Flexes metacarpal V at
    carpometacarpal joint when little finger is moved into opposition with tip of
    thumb; deepens palm of hand.\n\n\t\t\n\n\n== Clinical significance ==\n\n===
    Congenital disorders ===\n\nThe fourth and fifth metacarpal bones are commonly
    \"blunted\" or shortened, in pseudohypoparathyroidism and pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism.\n\nA
    blunted fourth metacarpal, with normal fifth metacarpal, can signify Turner syndrome.\n\nBlunted
    metacarpals (particularly the fourth metacarpal) are a symptom of Nevoid basal
    cell carcinoma syndrome.\n\n\n=== Fracture ===\n\nThe neck of a metacarpal is
    a common location for a boxer's fracture. \n\nHowever, all parts of the metacarpal
    bone (including head, body and base) are susceptible to fracture. \n\nFor these
    fractures several types of treatment exist ranging from non-operative techniques
    with or without immobilization to operative techniques using closed or open reduction
    and internal fixation (ORIF). \n\nGenerally speaking most fractures showing little
    or no displacement can be treated successfully without surgery. \n\nIntraarticular
    fracture-dislocations of the metacarpal head or base may require surgical fixation,
    as fragment displacement affecting the joint surface is rarely tolerated well.\n\n\n==
    Other animals ==\n\nIn four-legged animals, the metacarpals form part of the
    forefeet, and are frequently reduced in number, appropriate to the number of
    toes. \n\nIn digitigrade and unguligrade animals, the metacarpals are greatly
    extended and strengthened, forming an additional segment to the limb, a feature
    that typically enhances the animal's speed. \n\nIn both birds and bats, the metacarpals
    form part of the wing.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Etymology ===\n\nThe Greek physician
    Galen used to refer to the metacarpus as \u03BC\u03B5\u03C4\u03B1\u03BA\u03AC\u03C1\u03C0\u03B9\u03BF\u03BD.
    \n\nThe Latin form metacarpium more truly resembles its Ancient Greek predecessor
    \u03BC\u03B5\u03C4\u03B1\u03BA\u03AC\u03C1\u03C0\u03B9\u03BF\u03BD than metacarpus.
    \n\nMeta\u2013 is Greek for beyond and carpal from Ancient Greek \u03BA\u03B1\u03C1\u03C0\u03CC\u03C2
    (karp\xF3s, \u201Cwrist\u201D).\n\nIn anatomic Latin, adjectives like metacarpius,
    metacarpicus, metacarpiaeus, metacarpeus, metacarpianus and metacarpalis can
    be found. \n\nThe form metacarpius is more true to the later Greek form \u03BC\u03B5\u03C4\u03B1\u03BA\u03AC\u03C1\u03C0\u03B9\u03BF\u03C2.
    \n\nMetacarpalis, as in ossa metacarpalia in the current official Latin nomenclature,
    Terminologia Anatomica is a compound consisting of Latin and Greek parts. \n\nThe
    usage of such hybrids in anatomic Latin is disapproved by some.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacarpal_bones"

  descriptionText: "\n\nMOLAR (TOOTH)\n\n\nThe molars or molar teeth are large, flat
    teeth at the back of the mouth. \n\nThey are more developed in mammals. \n\nThey
    are used primarily to grind food during chewing. \n\nThe name molar derives from
    Latin, molaris dens, meaning \"millstone tooth\", from mola, millstone and dens,
    tooth. \n\nMolars show a great deal of diversity in size and shape across mammal
    groups. \n\nThe third molar of humans is sometimes vestigial.\n\n\n== Human anatomy
    ==\n\n\nIn humans, the molar teeth have either four or five cusps. \n\nAdult
    humans have 12 molars, in four groups of three at the back of the mouth. \n\nThe
    third, rearmost molar in each group is called a wisdom tooth. \n\nIt is the last
    tooth to appear, breaking through the front of the gum at about the age of 20,
    although this varies from individual to individual. \n\nRace can also affect
    the age at which this occurs, with statistical variations between groups. \n\nIn
    some cases, it may not even erupt at all.\nThe human mouth contains upper (maxillary)
    and lower (mandibular) molars. \n\nThey are: maxillary first molar, maxillary
    second molar, maxillary third molar, mandibular first molar, mandibular second
    molar, and mandibular third molar.\n\n\n== Mammal evolution ==\n\n\nIn mammals,
    the crown of the molars and premolars is folded into a wide range of complex
    shapes. \n\nThe basic elements of the crown are the more or less conical projections
    called cusps and the valleys that separate them. \n\nThe cusps contain both dentine
    and enamel, whereas minor projections on the crown, called crenulations, are
    the result of different enamel thickness. \n\nCusps are occasionally joined to
    form ridges and expanded to form crests. \n\nCingula are often incomplete ridges
    that pass around the base of the crown.Mammalian, multicusped cheek teeth probably
    evolved from single-cusped teeth in synapsids, although the diversity of therapsid
    molar patterns and the complexity in the molars of the earliest mammals make
    determining how this happened impossible. \n\nAccording to the widely accepted
    \"differentiation theory\", additional cusps have arisen by budding or outgrowth
    from the crown, while the rivalling \"concrescence theory\" instead proposes
    that complex teeth evolved by the clustering of originally separate conical teeth.
    \n\nTherian mammals (placentals and marsupials) are generally agreed to have
    evolved from an ancestor with tribosphenic cheek teeth, with three main cusps
    arranged in a triangle.\n\n\n== Morphology ==\n\n\nEach major cusp on an upper
    molar is called a cone and is identified by a prefix dependent on its relative
    location on the tooth: proto-, para-, meta-, hypo-, and ento-. \n\nSuffixes are
    added to these names: -id is added to cusps on a lower molar (e.g., protoconid);
    -ule to a minor cusp (e.g., protoconulid). \n\nA shelf-like ridge on the lower
    part of the crown (on an upper molar) is called a cingulum; the same feature
    on the lower molar a cingulid, and a minor cusp on these, for example, a cingular
    cuspule or conulid.\n\n\n=== Tribosphenic ===\n\n\nThe design that is considered
    one of the most important characteristics of mammals is a three-cusped shape
    called a tribosphenic molar. \n\nThis molar design has two important features:
    the trigonid, or shearing end, and the talonid, or crushing heel. \n\nIn modern
    tribosphenic molars, the trigonid is towards the front of the jaw and the talonid
    is towards the rear.\n\nThe tribosphenic tooth is found in insectivores and young
    platypuses (adults have no teeth). \n\nUpper molars look like three-pointed mountain
    ranges; lowers look like two peaks and a third off to the side.\nThe tribosphenic
    design appears primitively in all groups of mammals. \n\nSome paleontologists
    believe that it developed independently in monotremes (or australosphenidans),
    rather than being inherited from an ancestor that they share with marsupials
    and placentals (or boreosphenidans); but this idea has critics and the debate
    is still going on. \n\nFor example, the dentition of the Early Cretaceous monotreme
    Steropodon is similar to those of Peramus and dryolestoids, which suggests that
    monotremes are related to some pre-tribosphenic therian mammals, but, on the
    other hand, the status of neither of these two groups is well-established.\n\nSome
    Jurassic mammals, such as Shuotherium and Pseudotribos, have \"reversed tribosphenic\"
    molars, in which the talonid is towards the front. \n\nThis variant is regarded
    as an example of convergent evolution.From the primitive tribosphenic tooth,
    molars have diversified into several unique morphologies. \n\nIn many groups,
    a fourth cusp, the hypocone (hypoconid), subsequently evolved (see below).\n\n\n===
    Quadrate ===\n\n\nQuadrate (also called quadritubercular or euthemorphic) molars
    have an additional fourth cusp on the lingual (tongue) side called the hypocone,
    located posterior to the protocone. \n\nQuadrate molars appeared early in mammal
    evolution and are present in many species, including hedgehogs, raccoons, and
    many primates, including humans.\n\nThere may be a fifth cusp.\n\nIn many mammals,
    additional smaller cusps called conules appear between the larger cusps. \n\nThey
    are named after their locations, e.g. a paraconule is located between a paracone
    and a metacone, a hypoconulid is located between a hypoconid and an entoconid.\n\n\n===
    Bunodont ===\n\n\nIn bunodont molars, the cusps are low and rounded hills rather
    than sharp peaks. \n\nThey are most common among omnivores such as pigs, bears,
    and humans. \n\nBunodont molars are effective crushing devices and often basically
    quadrate in shape.\n\n\n=== Hypsodont ===\n\nHypsodont dentition is characterized
    by high-crowned teeth and enamel that extends far past the gum line, which provides
    extra material for wear and tear. \n\nSome examples of animals with hypsodont
    dentition are cattle and horses, all animals that feed on gritty, fibrous material.
    \n\nHypsodont molars can continue to grow throughout life, for example in some
    species of Arvicolinae (herbivorous rodents).Hypsodont molars lack both a crown
    and a neck. \n\nThe occlusal surface is rough and mostly flat, adapted for crushing
    and grinding plant material. \n\nThe body is covered with cementum both above
    and below the gingival line, below which is a layer of enamel covering the entire
    length of the body. \n\nThe cementum and the enamel invaginate into the thick
    layer of dentin.\n\n\n=== Brachydont ===\n\nThe opposite condition to hypsodont
    is called brachydont or brachyodont (from brachys 'short'). \n\nIt is a type
    of dentition characterized by low-crowned teeth. \n\nHuman teeth are brachydont.A
    brachydont tooth has a crown above the gingival line and a neck just below it,
    and at least one root. \n\nA cap of enamel covers the crown and extends down
    to the neck. \n\nCementum is only found below the gingival line. \n\nThe occlusal
    surfaces tend to be pointed, well-suited for holding prey and tearing and shredding.\n\n\n===
    Zalambdodont ===\n\nZalambdodont molars have three cusps, one larger on the lingual
    side and two smaller on the labial side, joined by two crests that form a V-
    or \u03BB-shape. \n\nThe larger inner cusp might be homologous with the paracone
    in a tribosphenic molar, but can also be fused with the metacone. \n\nThe protocone
    is typically missing. \n\nThe two smaller labial cusps are located on an expanded
    shelf called the stylar shelf. \n\nZalambdodont molars are found in, for example,
    golden moles and solenodons.\n\n\n=== Dilambdodont ===\n\nLike zalambdodont molars,
    dilambdodont molars have a distinct ectoloph, but are shaped like two lambdas
    or a W. \n\nOn the lingual side, at the bottom of the W, are the metacone and
    paracone, and the stylar shelf is on the labial side. \n\nA protocone is present
    lingual to the ectoloph. \n\nDilambdodont molars are present in shrews, moles,
    and some insectivorous bats.\n\n\n=== Lophodont ===\n\n\nLophodont teeth are
    easily identified by the differentiating patterns of ridges or lophs of enamel
    interconnecting the cusps on the crowns. \n\nPresent in most herbivores, these
    patterns of lophs can be a simple, ring-like edge, as in mole rats, or a complex
    arrangement of series of ridges and cross-ridges, as those in odd-toed ungulates,
    such as equids.Lophodont molars have hard and elongated enamel ridges called
    lophs oriented either along or perpendicular to the dental row. \n\nLophodont
    molars are common in herbivores that grind their food thoroughly. \n\nExamples
    include tapirs, manatees, and many rodents.When two lophs form transverse, often
    ring-shaped, ridges on a tooth, the arrangement is called bilophodont. \n\nThis
    pattern is common in primates, but can also be found in lagomorphs (hares, rabbits,
    and pikas) and some rodents.\n\nExtreme forms of lophodonty in elephants and
    some rodents (such as Otomys) is known as loxodonty. \n\nThe African elephant
    belongs to a genus called Loxodonta because of this feature.\n\n\n=== Selenodont
    ===\n\nIn selenodont molars (so-named after moon goddess Selene), the major cusp
    is elongated into crescent-shaped ridge. \n\nExamples include most even-toed
    ungulates, such as cattle and deer.\n\n\n=== Secodont ===\n\n\nMany carnivorous
    mammals have enlarged and blade-like teeth especially adapted for slicing and
    chopping called carnassials. \n\nA general term for such blade-like teeth is
    secodont or plagiaulacoid.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_(tooth)"

  descriptionText: "\n\nSECOND RIB\n\n\nThe second rib is the second uppermost rib
    in humans or second most frontal in animals that walk on four limbs. \n\nIn humans,
    the second rib is defined as a true rib since it connects with the sternum through
    the intervention of the costal cartilage anteriorly (at the front). \n\nPosteriorly,
    the second rib is connected with the vertebral column by the second thoracic
    vertebra. \n\nThe second rib is much longer than the first rib, but has a very
    similar curvature. \n\nThe non-articular portion of the tubercle is occasionally
    only feebly marked. \n\nThe angle is slight and situated close to the tubercle.
    \n\nThe body is not twisted so that both ends touch any plane surface upon which
    it may be laid; but there is a bend, with its convexity upward, similar to, though
    smaller than that found in the first rib. \n\nThe body is not flattened horizontally
    like that of the first rib. \n\nIts external surface is convex, and looks upward
    and a little outward; near the middle of it is a rough eminence for the origin
    of the lower part of the first and the whole of the second digitation of the
    serratus anterior; behind and above this is attached the posterior scalene. \n\nThe
    internal surface, smooth, and concave, is directed downward and a little inward:
    on its posterior part there is a short costal groove between the ridge of the
    internal surface of the rib and the inferior border. \n\nIt protects the intercostal
    space containing the intercostal veins, intercostal arteries, and intercostal
    nerves."

  descriptionText: "\n\nCOSTAL CARTILAGE(S)\n\n\nThe costal cartilages are bars of
    hyaline cartilage that serve to prolong the ribs forward and contribute to the
    elasticity of the walls of the thorax. \n\nCostal cartilage is only found at
    the anterior ends of the ribs, providing medial extension.\n\n\n== Differences
    from Ribs 1-12 ==\n\nThe first seven pairs are connected with the sternum; the
    next three are each articulated with the lower border of the cartilage of the
    preceding rib; the last two have pointed extremities, which end in the wall of
    the abdomen.Like the ribs, the costal cartilages vary in their length, breadth,
    and direction. \n\nThey increase in length from the first to the seventh, then
    gradually decrease to the twelfth.\n\nTheir breadth, as well as that of the intervals
    between them, diminishes from the first to the last. \n\nThey are broad at their
    attachments to the ribs, and taper toward their sternal extremities, excepting
    the first two, which are of the same breadth throughout, and the sixth, seventh,
    and eighth, which are enlarged where their margins are in contact.\n\nThey also
    vary in direction: the first descends a little to the sternum, the second is
    horizontal, the third ascends slightly, while the others are angular, following
    the course of the ribs for a short distance, and then ascending to the sternum
    or preceding cartilage.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nEach costal cartilage presents
    two surfaces, two borders, and two extremities.\n\n\n=== Surfaces ===\n\nThe
    anterior surface is convex, and looks forward and upward: that of the first gives
    attachment to the costoclavicular ligament and the subclavius muscle; those of
    the first six or seven at their sternal ends, to the pectoralis major. \n\nThe
    others are covered by, and give partial attachment to, some of the flat muscles
    of the abdomen.\n\nThe posterior surface is concave, and directed backward and
    downward; that of the first gives attachment to the sternothyroideus, those of
    the third to the sixth inclusive to the transversus thoracis muscle, and the
    six or seven inferior ones to the transversus abdominis muscle and the diaphragm.\n\n\n===
    Borders ===\n\nOf the two borders the superior is concave, the inferior convex;
    they afford attachment to the intercostales interni: the upper border of the
    sixth gives attachment also to the pectoralis major.\n\nThe inferior borders
    of the sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth cartilages present heel-like projections
    at the points of greatest convexity. \n\nThese projections carry smooth oblong
    facets which articulate with facets on slight projections from the upper borders
    of the seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth cartilages, respectively.\n\n\n=== Interchondral
    articulations ===\n\nThe interchondral articulations are the joints formed between
    the costal cartilages of the ribs. \n\nThe contiguous borders of the sixth, seventh,
    and eighth, and sometimes those of the ninth and tenth, costal cartilages articulate
    with each other by small, smooth, oblong facets. \n\nEach articulation is enclosed
    in a thin articular capsule, lined by synovial membrane and strengthened laterally
    and medially by ligamentous fibers (interchondral ligaments) which pass from
    one cartilage to the other. \n\nSometimes the fifth costal cartilages, more rarely
    the ninth and tenth, articulate by their lower borders with the adjoining cartilages
    by small oval facets; more frequently the connection is by a few ligamentous
    fibers.\n\n\n=== Extremities ===\n\nThe lateral end of each cartilage is continuous
    with the osseous tissue of the rib to which it belongs.\n\nThe medial end of
    the first is continuous with the sternum; the medial ends of the six succeeding
    ones are rounded and are received into shallow concavities on the lateral margins
    of the sternum.\n\nThe medial ends of the eighth, ninth, and tenth costal cartilages
    are pointed, and are connected each with the cartilage immediately above.\n\nThose
    of the eleventh and twelfth are pointed and free.\n\n\n== Clinical significance
    ==\n\nIn old age, the costal cartilages are prone to superficial ossification.In
    costochondritis and Tietze syndrome, inflammation of the costal cartilage occurs.
    \n\nThis is a common cause of chest pain.Severe trauma may lead to fracture of
    the costal cartilage. \n\nSuch injuries often go unnoticed during x-ray scans,
    but can be diagnosed with CT scans. \n\nSurgery is typically used to fix the
    costal cartilage back onto either the rib or sternum.Costal cartilage may be
    harvested for reparative use elsewhere in the body. \n\nWhilst this is typically
    conducted using a general anaesthetic, IV sedation can also be used. \n\nThe
    procedure presents a minor risk of pleural tear.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costal_cartilage"

  descriptionText: "\n\nSCAPHOID BONE\n\n\nThe scaphoid bone is one of the carpal
    bones of the wrist. \n\nIt is situated between the hand and forearm on the thumb
    side of the wrist (also called the lateral or radial side). \n\nIt forms the
    radial border of the carpal tunnel. \n\nThe scaphoid bone is the largest bone
    of the proximal row of wrist bones, its long axis being from above downward,
    lateralward, and forward. \n\nIt is approximately the size and shape of a medium
    cashew.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe scaphoid is situated between the proximal
    and distal rows of carpal bones. \n\nIt is located on the radial side of the
    wrist, and articulates with the radius, lunate, trapezoid, trapezium and capitate.:\u200A176\u200A
    Over 80% of the bone is covered in articular cartilage.\n\n\n=== Bone ===\n\nThe
    palmar surface of the scaphoid is concave, and forming a tubercle, giving attachment
    to the transverse carpal ligament. \n\nThe proximal surface is triangular, smooth
    and convex, and articulates with the radius and adjacent carpal bones, namely
    the lunate, capitate, trapezium and trapezoid. \n\nThe lateral surface is narrow
    and gives attachment to the radial collateral ligament. \n\nThe medial surface
    has two facets, a flattened semi-lunar facet articulating with the lunate bone,
    and an inferior concave facet, articulating alongside the lunate with the head
    of the capitate bone.The dorsal surface of the bone is narrow, with a groove
    running the length of the bone and allowing ligaments to attach, and the surface
    facing the fingers (anatomically inferior) is smooth and convex, also triangular,
    and divided into two parts by a slight ridge.\n\n\n=== Blood supply ===\n\nIt
    receives its blood supply primarily from lateral and distal branches of the radial
    artery, via palmar and dorsal branches. \n\nThese provide an \"abundant\" supply
    to middle and distal portions of the bone, but neglect the proximal portion,
    which relies on retrograde flow.:\u200A189\u200A The dorsal branch supplies the
    majority of the middle and distal portions, with the palmar branch supplying
    only the distal third of the bone.\n\n\n=== Variation ===\n\nThe dorsal blood
    supply, particularly of the proximal portion, is highly variable.:\u200A189\u200A
    Sometimes the fibers of the abductor pollicis brevis emerge from the tubercle.\n\n\n===
    In animals ===\n\nIn reptiles, birds, and amphibians, this bone is instead commonly
    referred to as the radiale because of its articulation with the radius.\n\n\n==
    Function ==\n\nThe carpal bones function as a unit to provide a bony superstructure
    for the hand.:\u200A708\u200A The scaphoid is also involved in movement of the
    wrist.:\u200A6\u200A It, along with the lunate, articulates with the radius and
    ulna to form the major bones involved in movement of the wrist. \n\nThe scaphoid
    serves as a link between the two rows of carpal bones. \n\nWith wrist movement,
    the scaphoid may flex from its position in the same plane as the forearm to perpendicular.:\u200A176\u2013177\u200A\n\n\n==
    Clinical significance ==\n\n\n\n=== Fracture ===\n\n\nFractures of the scaphoid
    are the most common of the carpal bone injuries, because of its connections with
    the two rows of carpal bones.:\u200A177\u200AThe scaphoid can be slow to heal
    because of the limited circulation to the bone. \n\nFractures of the scaphoid
    must be recognized and treated quickly, as prompt treatment by immobilization
    or surgical fixation increases the likelihood of the bone healing in anatomic
    alignment, thus avoiding mal-union or non-union. \n\nDelays may compromise healing.
    \n\nFailure of the fracture to heal (\"non-union\") will lead to post-traumatic
    osteoarthritis of the carpus.:\u200A189\u200A One reason for this is because
    of the \"tenuous\" blood supply to the proximal segment. \n\nEven rapidly immobilized
    fractures may require surgical treatment, including use of a headless compression
    screw such as the Herbert screw to bind the two halves together.\nHealing of
    the fracture with a non-anatomic deformity (frequently, a volar flexed \"humpback\")
    can also lead to post-traumatic arthritis. \n\nNon-unions can result in loss
    of blood supply to the proximal pole, which can result in avascular necrosis
    of the proximal segment.\nScaphoid fractures may be difficult to diagnose via
    plain x-ray, so repeat x-ray may be used at a later date, or cross-sectional
    imaging via MRI or CT scan.\n\n\n=== Other diseases ===\n\nA condition called
    scapholunate instability can occur when the scapholunate ligament (connecting
    the scaphoid to the lunate bone) and other surrounding ligaments are disrupted.
    \n\nIn this state, the distance between the scaphoid and lunate bones is increased.:\u200A180\u200AThere
    is a rare disease of this bone called Preiser's Disease.\n\n\n=== Palpation ===\n\nThe
    scaphoid can be palpated at the base of the anatomical snuff box. \n\nIt can
    also be palpated in the volar (palmar) hand/wrist. \n\nIts position is the intersections
    of the long axes of the four fingers while in a fist, or the base of the thenar
    eminence. \n\nWhen palpated in this position, the bone will be felt to slide
    forward during radial deviation (wrist abduction) and flexion.\nClicking of the
    scaphoid or no anterior translation can indicate scapholunate instability.\n\n\n==
    Etymology ==\n\nThe etymology of the scaphoid bone (Greek: \u03C3\u03BA\u03B1\u03C6\u03BF\u03B5\u03B9\u03B4\u03AD\u03C2)
    is derived from the Greek skaphos, which means \"a boat,\" and the Greek eidos,
    which means \"kind\". \n\nThe name refers to the shape of the bone, supposedly
    reminiscent of a boat. \n\nIn older literature about human anatomy, the scaphoid
    is referred to as the navicular bone of the hand (this time from the Latin word
    \u201Cnavis\u201D = boat), since there is also a bone in a similar position in
    the foot which is called the navicular. \n\nThe medical term for the bone is
    the scaphoid, as the term \"navicular\" is solely reserved for the bone located
    in the tarsals of the human body.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaphoid_bone"

  descriptionText: "\n\nPHALANX\n\n\nThe phalanx (Ancient Greek: \u03C6\u03AC\u03BB\u03B1\u03B3\u03BE;
    plural phalanxes or phalanges, \u03C6\u03AC\u03BB\u03B1\u03B3\u03B3\u03B5\u03C2,
    phalanges) was a rectangular mass military formation, usually composed entirely
    of heavy infantry armed with spears, pikes, sarissas, or similar pole weapons.
    \n\nThe term is particularly used to describe the use of this formation in Ancient
    Greek warfare, although the ancient Greek writers used it to also describe any
    massed infantry formation, regardless of its equipment. \n\nArrian uses the term
    in his Array against the Alans when he refers to his legions. \n\nIn Greek texts,
    the phalanx may be deployed for battle, on the march, or even camped, thus describing
    the mass of infantry or cavalry that would deploy in line during battle. \n\nThey
    marched forward as one entity. \nThe term itself, as used today, does not refer
    to a distinctive military unit or division (e.g., the Roman legion or the contemporary
    Western-type battalion), but to the type of formation of an army's troops. \n\nTherefore,
    this term does not indicate a standard combat strength or composition but includes
    the total number of infantry, which is deployed in a single formation known as
    a \"phalanx\".\nMany spear-armed troops historically fought in what might be
    termed phalanx-like formations. \n\nThis article focuses on the use of the military
    phalanx formation in Ancient Greece, the Hellenistic world, and other ancient
    states heavily influenced by Greek civilization.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe earliest
    known depiction of a phalanx-like formation occurs in a Sumerian stele from the
    25th century BC. \n\nHere the troops seem to have been equipped with spears,
    helmets, and large shields covering the whole body. \n\nAncient Egyptian infantry
    were known to have employed similar formations. \n\nThe first usage of the term
    phalanx comes from Homer's \"\u03C6\u03B1\u03BB\u03B1\u03B3\u03BE\", used to
    describe hoplites fighting in an organized battle line. \n\nHomer used the term
    to differentiate the formation-based combat from the individual duels so often
    found in his poems.Historians have not arrived at a consensus about the relationship
    between the Greek formation and these predecessors of the hoplites. \n\nThe principles
    of shield wall and spear hedge were almost universally known among the armies
    of major civilizations throughout history, and so the similarities may be related
    to convergent evolution instead of diffusion.\nTraditionally, historians date
    the origin of the hoplite phalanx of ancient Greece to the 8th century BC in
    Sparta, but this is under revision. \n\nIt is perhaps more likely that the formation
    was devised in the 7th century BC after the introduction of the aspis by the
    city of Argos, which would have made the formation possible. \n\nThis is further
    evidenced by the Chigi vase, dated to 650 BC, identifying hoplites armed with
    aspis, spear and panoply.Another possible theory as to the birth of Greek phalanx
    warfare stems from the idea that some of the basic aspects of the phalanx were
    present in earlier times yet were not fully developed due to the lack of appropriate
    technology. \n\nTwo of the basic tactics seen in earlier warfare include the
    principle of cohesion and the use of large groups of soldiers. \n\nThis would
    suggest that the Greek phalanx was rather the culmination and perfection of a
    slowly developed idea that originated many years earlier. \n\nAs weaponry and
    armour advanced through the years in different city-states, the phalanx became
    complex and effective.\n\n\n== Overview ==\n\nThe hoplite phalanx of the Archaic
    and Classical periods in Greece (c. 800\u2013350 BC) was the formation in which
    the hoplites would line up in ranks in close order. \n\nThe hoplites would lock
    their shields together, and the first few ranks of soldiers would project their
    spears out over the first rank of shields. \n\nThe phalanx therefore presented
    a shield wall and a mass of spear points to the enemy, making frontal assaults
    against it very difficult. \n\nIt also allowed a higher proportion of the soldiers
    to be actively engaged in combat at a given time (rather than just those in the
    front rank).\nBattles between two phalanxes usually took place in open, flat
    plains where it was easier to advance and stay in formation. \n\nRough terrain
    or hilly regions would have made it difficult to maintain a steady line and would
    have defeated the purpose of a phalanx. \n\nAs a result, battles between Greek
    city-states would not take place in just any location, nor would they be limited
    to sometimes obvious strategic points. \n\nRather, many times, the two opposing
    sides would find the most suitable piece of land where the conflict could be
    settled. \n\nTypically, the battle ended with one of the two fighting forces
    fleeing to safety.The phalanx usually advanced at a walking pace, although it
    is possible that they picked up speed during the last several yards. \n\nOne
    of the main reasons for this slow approach was to maintain formation. \n\nThe
    formation would be rendered useless if the phalanx was lost as the unit approached
    the enemy and could even become detrimental to the advancing unit, resulting
    in a weaker formation that was easier for an enemy force to break through. \n\nIf
    the hoplites of the phalanx were to pick up speed toward the latter part of the
    advance, it would have been for the purpose of gaining momentum against the enemy
    in the initial collision. \n\nHerodotus states of the Greeks at the Battle of
    Marathon, that \"They were the first Greeks we know of to charge their enemy
    at a run\". \n\nMany historians believe that this innovation was precipitated
    by their desire to minimize their losses from Persian archery. \n\nThe opposing
    sides would collide, possibly severing many of the spears of the row in front
    and killing the front part of the enemy army due to the bone-breaking collision.\nThe
    spears of a phalanx had spiked butts. \n\nIn battle, the back ranks used the
    spikes to finish fallen enemy soldiers.\n\n\n=== Pushing ===\n\nThe \"physical
    pushing match\" theory is one where the battle would rely on the valour of the
    men in the front line, whilst those in the rear maintained forward pressure on
    the front ranks with their shields, and the whole formation would consistently
    press forward trying to break the enemy formation. \n\nThis is the most widely
    accepted interpretation of the ancient sources thus when two phalanx formations
    engaged, the struggle essentially became a pushing match. \n\nHistorians such
    as Victor Davis Hanson point out that it is difficult to account for exceptionally
    deep phalanx formations unless they were necessary to facilitate the physical
    pushing depicted by this theory, as those behind the first two ranks could not
    take part in the actual spear thrusting.No Greek art ever depicts anything like
    a phalanx pushing match, so this hypothesis is a product of educated speculation
    rather than explicit testimony from contemporary sources and is far from being
    academically resolved. \n\nThe Greek term for \"push\" was used in the same metaphorical
    manner as the English word is (for example it was also used to describe the process
    of rhetorical arguments) and so does not necessarily describe a literal physical
    push, although it is possible that it did.\nFor instance, if Othismos were to
    accurately describe a physical pushing match, it would be logical to state that
    the deeper phalanx would always win an engagement since the physical strength
    of individuals would not compensate for even one additional rank on the enemy
    side. \n\nHowever, there are numerous examples of shallow phalanxes holding off
    an opponent. \n\nFor instance, at Delium in 424 BC, the Athenian left flank,
    a formation eight men deep, held off a formation of Thebans 25 deep without immediate
    collapse. \n\nIt is difficult with the physical pushing model to imagine eight
    men withstanding the pushing force of 25 opponents for a matter of seconds, let
    alone half the battle.\nSuch arguments have led to a wave of counter-criticism
    to physical shoving theorists. \n\nAdrian Goldsworthy, in his article \"The Othismos,
    Myths and Heresies: The nature of Hoplite Battle\", argues that the physical
    pushing match model does not fit with the average casualty figures of hoplite
    warfare nor the practical realities of moving large formations of men in battle.
    \n\nThis debate has yet to be resolved amongst scholars.\nPractical difficulties
    with this theory also include the fact that, in a shoving match, an eight-foot
    spear is too long to fight effectively or even parry attacks. \n\nSpears enable
    a formation of men to keep their enemies at a distance, parry attacks aimed at
    them and their comrades, and give the necessary reach to strike multiple men
    in the opposite formation. \n\nA pushing match would put enemies so close together
    that a quick stabbing with a knife would kill the front row almost instantly.
    \n\nThe crush of men would also prevent the formation from withdrawing or retreating,
    which would result in much higher casualties than is recorded. \n\nThe speed
    at which this would occur would also end the battle very quickly, instead of
    prolonging it for hours.\n\n\n=== Shields ===\n\nEach individual hoplite carried
    his shield on his left arm, protecting not only himself but also the soldier
    to the left. \n\nThis meant that the men at the extreme right of the phalanx
    were only half-protected. \n\nIn battle, opposing phalanxes would try to exploit
    this weakness by attempting to overlap the enemy's right flank. \n\nIt also meant
    that, in battle, a phalanx would tend to drift to the right (as hoplites sought
    to remain behind the shield of their neighbor). \n\nSome groups, such as the
    Spartans at Nemea, tried to use this phenomenon to their advantage. \n\nIn this
    case, the phalanx would sacrifice its left side, which typically consisted of
    allied troops, in an effort to overtake the enemy from the flank. \n\nIt is unlikely
    that this strategy worked very often, as it is not mentioned frequently in ancient
    Greek literature.There was a leader in each row of a phalanx, and a rear rank
    officer, the ouragos (meaning tail-leader), who kept order in the rear. \n\nThe
    hoplites had to trust their neighbors to protect them and in turn be willing
    to protect their neighbors; a phalanx was thus only as strong as its weakest
    elements. \n\nThe effectiveness of the phalanx therefore depended on how well
    the hoplites could maintain this formation in combat and how well they could
    stand their ground, especially when engaged against another phalanx. \n\nFor
    this reason, the formation was deliberately organized to group friends and family
    close together, thus providing a psychological incentive to support one's fellows,
    and a disincentive, through shame, to panic or attempt to flee. \n\nThe more
    disciplined and courageous the army, the more likely it was to win \u2013 often
    engagements between the various city-states of Greece would be resolved by one
    side fleeing before the battle. \n\nThe Greek word dynamis, the 'will to fight',
    expresses the drive that kept hoplites in formation.\n\nNow of those, who dare,
    abiding one beside another, to advance to the close fray, and the foremost champions,
    fewer die, and they save the people in the rear; but in men that fear, all excellence
    is lost. \n\nNo one could ever in words go through those several ills, which
    befall a man, if he has been actuated by cowardice. \n\nFor 'tis grievous to
    wound in the rear the back of a flying man in hostile war. \n\nShameful too is
    a corpse lying low in the dust, wounded behind in the back by the point of a
    spear.\n\n\n=== Hoplite armament ===\n\nEach hoplite provided his own equipment.
    \n\nThe primary hoplite weapon was a spear around 2.4 metres (7.9 ft) in length
    called a dory. \n\nAlthough accounts of its length vary, it is usually now believed
    to have been seven to nine feet long (~2.1\u20132.7 m). \n\nIt was held one-handed,
    with the other hand holding the hoplite's shield (aspis). \n\nThe spearhead was
    usually a curved leaf shape, while the rear of the spear had a spike called a
    sauroter ('lizard-killer') which was used to stand the spear in the ground (hence
    the name). \n\nIt was also used as a secondary weapon if the main shaft snapped
    or to kill enemies lying on the ground. \n\nThis was a common problem, especially
    for soldiers who were involved in the initial clash with the enemy. \n\nDespite
    the snapping of the spear, hoplites could easily switch to the sauroter without
    great consequence. \n\nThe rear ranks used the secondary end to finish off fallen
    opponents as the phalanx advanced over them.\nThroughout the hoplite era, the
    standard hoplite armour went through many cyclical changes. \n\nAn Archaic hoplite
    typically wore a bronze breastplate, a bronze helmet with cheekplates, as well
    as greaves and other armour. \n\nLater, in the classical period, the breastplate
    became less common, replaced instead with a corselet that some claim was made
    of linothorax (layers of linen glued together), or perhaps of leather, sometimes
    covered in whole or in part with overlapping metal scales. \n\nEventually, even
    greaves became less commonly used, although degrees of heavier armour remained,
    as attested by Xenophon as late as 401 BC.These changes reflected the balancing
    of mobility with protection, especially as cavalry became more prominent in the
    Peloponnesian War and the need to combat light troops, which were increasingly
    used to negate the hoplite's role as the primary force in battle. \n\nYet bronze
    armour remained in some form until the end of the hoplite era. \n\nSome archaeologists
    have pointed out that bronze armour does not actually provide as much protection
    from direct blows as more extensive corselet padding, and have suggested its
    continued use was a matter of status for those who could afford it. \n\nIn the
    classical Greek dialect, there is no word for swordsmen; yet hoplites also carried
    a short sword called the xiphos, used as a secondary weapon if the dory was broken
    or lost. \n\nSamples of the xiphos recovered at excavation sites were typically
    around 60 cm (24 in) in length. \n\nThese swords were double-edged and could
    therefore be used as a cutting and thrusting weapon. \n\nThese short swords were
    often used to stab or cut at the enemy's neck during close combat.Hoplites carried
    a circular shield called a hoplon (often referred to as an aspis) made from wood
    and covered in bronze, measuring roughly 1 metre (3.3 ft) in diameter. \n\nIt
    spanned from chin to knee and was very heavy (8\u201315 kg (18\u201333 lb)).
    \n\nThis medium-sized shield (fairly large for the period considering the average
    male height) was made possible partly by its dish-like shape, which allowed it
    to be supported with the rim on the shoulder. \n\nThis was quite an important
    feature of the shield, especially for the hoplites that remained in the latter
    ranks. \n\nWhile these soldiers continued to help press forward, they did not
    have the added burden of holding up their shield. \n\nBut the circular shield
    was not without its disadvantages. \n\nDespite its mobility, protective curve,
    and double straps the circular shape created gaps in the shield wall at both
    its top and bottom. (Top gaps were somewhat reduced by the one or two spears
    jutting out of the gap. \n\nIn order to minimize the bottom gaps, thick leather
    'curtains' were used but only by an [unknown] percentage of the hoplites, possibly
    mostly in the first row only since there were disadvantages as well: considerable
    added weight on an already heavy shield and a certain additional cost.) These
    gaps left parts of the hoplite exposed to potentially lethal spear thrusts and
    were a persistent vulnerability for hoplites controlling the front lines.\n\n\n===
    Phalangite armament ===\n\nThe phalanx of the Ancient Macedonian kingdom and
    the later Hellenistic successor states was a development of the hoplite phalanx.
    \n\nThe 'phalangites' were armed with a much longer spear, the sarissa, and less
    heavily armoured. \n\nThe sarissa was the pike used by the ancient Macedonian
    army. \n\nIts actual length is unknown, but apparently it was twice as long as
    the dory. \n\nThis makes it at least 14 feet (4.3 m), but 18 feet (5.5 m) appears
    more likely. (The cavalry xyston was 12.5 feet (3.8 m) by comparison.) The great
    length of the pike was balanced by a counterweight at the rear end, which also
    functioned as a butt-spike, allowing the sarissa to be planted into the ground.
    \n\nBecause of its great length, weight and different balance, a sarissa was
    wielded two-handed. \n\nThis meant that the aspis was no longer a practical defence.
    \n\nInstead, the phalangites strapped a smaller pelte shield (usually reserved
    for peltasts, light skirmishers) to their left forearm. \n\nRecent theories,
    including examination of ancient frescoes depicting full sets of weapons and
    armor, claim that the shields used were actually larger than the pelte but smaller
    than the aspis, hanging by leather strap(s) from the left shoulder or from both
    shoulders. \n\nThe shield would retain handling straps in the inner curve, to
    be handled like a (smaller) aspis if the fight progressed to sword-wielding.
    \n\nAlthough in both shield size assumptions this reduced the shield wall, the
    extreme length of the spear kept the enemy at a greater distance, as the pikes
    of the first three to five ranks could all be brought to bear in front of the
    front row. \n\nThis pike had to be held underhand, as the shield would have obscured
    the soldier's vision had it been held overhead. \n\nIt would also be very hard
    to remove a sarissa from anything it stuck in (the earth, shields, and soldiers
    of the opposition) if it were thrust downwards, due to its length. \n\nThe Macedonian
    phalanx was much less able to form a shield wall, but the lengthened spears would
    have compensated for this. \n\nSuch a phalanx formation also reduced the likelihood
    that battles would degenerate into a pushing match.\n\n\n== Deployment and combat
    ==\n\n=== Phalanx composition and strength ===\n\nThe basic combat element of
    the Greek armies was either the stichos (meaning 'file'; usually 8\u201316 men
    strong) or the enomotia (meaning 'sworn' and made up by 2\u20134 stich\u0153,
    totaling up to 32 men), both led by a dim\u0153rites who was assisted by a decadarchos
    and two decaster\u0153 (sing. decasteros). \n\nFour to a maximum of 32 enomoti\xE6
    (depending on the era in question or the city) were forming a lochos led by a
    lochagos, who in this way was in command of initially 100 hoplites to a maximum
    of c. 500 in the late Hellenistic armies. \n\nHere, it has to be noted that the
    military manuals of Asclepiodotus and Aelian use the term lochos to denote a
    file in the phalanx. \n\nA taxis (mora for the Spartans) was the greatest standard
    hoplitic formation of 500 to 1500 men, led by a strategos (general). \n\nThe
    entire army, a total of several taxeis or mor\xE6 was led by a generals' council.
    \n\nThe commander-in-chief was usually called a polemarchos or a strategos autocrator.\n\n\n===
    Phalanx front and depth ===\n\nHoplite phalanxes usually deployed in ranks of
    eight men or more deep; the Macedonian phalanxes were usually 16 men deep, sometimes
    reported to have been arrayed 32 men deep. \n\nThere are some notable extremes;
    at the battles of Leuctra and Mantinea, the Theban general Epaminondas arranged
    the left wing of the phalanx into a \"hammerhead\" of 50 ranks of elite hoplites
    deep (see below) and when depth was less important, phalanxes just four deep
    are recorded, as at the battle of Marathon.The phalanx depth could vary depending
    on the needs of the moment and plans of the general. \n\nWhile the phalanx was
    in march, an eis bathos formation (loose, meaning literally 'in depth') was adopted
    in order to move more freely and maintain order. \n\nThis was also the initial
    battle formation as, in addition, it permitted friendly units to pass through
    whether assaulting or retreating. \n\nIn this status, the phalanx had twice the
    normal depth and each hoplite had to occupy about 1.8\u20132 metres (5 ft 11
    in\u20136 ft 7 in) in width. \n\nWhen enemy infantry was approaching, a rapid
    switch to the pycne (spelled also pucne) formation (dense or tight formation)
    was necessary. \n\nIn that case, each man's space was halved (0.9\u20131 metre
    or 2 feet 11 inches\u20133 feet 3 inches in width) and the formation depth returned
    to normal. \n\nAn even denser formation, the synaspismos or sunaspismos (ultra-tight
    or locked shields formation), was used when the phalanx was expected to experience
    extra pressure, intense missile volleys or frontal cavalry charges. \n\nIn synaspismos,
    the rank depth was half that of a normal phalanx and the width each man occupied
    was as small as 0.45 metres (1.5 ft).\n\n\n=== Stages of combat ===\n\nSeveral
    stages in hoplite combat can be defined:\nEphodos: The hoplites stop singing
    their p\xE6anes (battle hymns) and move towards the enemy, gradually picking
    up pace and momentum. \n\nIn the instants before impact, war cries (alalagm\u0153,
    sing. alalagmos) would be made. \n\nNotable war cries were the Athenian (eleleleleu!
    eleleleleu!) and the Macedonian (alalalalai! alalalalai!) alalagm\u0153.\nKrousis:
    The opposing phalanxes meet each other almost simultaneously along their front.
    \nDoratismos: Repeated, rapid spear thrusts in order to disrupt the enemy formation.
    \n\nThe use of long spears would keep enemies apart as well as allow men in a
    row to assist their comrades next to them. \n\nThe prodding could also open up
    a man to allow a comrade to spear him. \n\nToo hard prodding could get a spear
    stuck in a shield, which would necessitate someone in the back to lend his to
    the now-disarmed man.\nOthismos: Literally 'pushing' after most spears have been
    broken, the hoplites begin to push with their spears and spear shafts against
    their opponents' shields. \n\nThis could be the longest phase.Pararrhexis: 'Breaching'
    the opposing phalanx, the enemy formation shatters and the battle ends. \n\nCavalry
    would be used at this point to mop up the scattered enemy.\n\n\n== Tactics ==\n\nThe
    early history of the phalanx is largely one of combat between hoplite armies
    from competing Greek city-states. \n\nThe usual result was rather identical,
    inflexible formations pushing against each other until one broke. \n\nThe potential
    of the phalanx to achieve something more was demonstrated at Battle of Marathon
    (490 BC). \n\nFacing the much larger army of Darius I, the Athenians thinned
    out their phalanx and consequently lengthened their front, to avoid being outflanked.
    \n\nHowever, even a reduced-depth phalanx proved unstoppable to the lightly armed
    Persian infantry. \n\nAfter routing the Persian wings, the hoplites on the Athenian
    wings wheeled inwards, destroying the elite troop at the Persian centre, resulting
    in a crushing victory for Athens. \n\nThroughout the Greco-Persian Wars the hoplite
    phalanx was to prove superior to the Persian infantry (e.g. the battles of Thermopylae
    and Plataea).\nPerhaps the most prominent example of the phalanx's evolution
    was the oblique order, made famous in the Battle of Leuctra. \n\nThere, the Theban
    general Epaminondas thinned out the right flank and centre of his phalanx, and
    deepened his left flank to an unheard-of 50 men deep. \n\nIn doing so, Epaminondas
    reversed the convention by which the right flank of the phalanx was strongest.
    \n\nThis allowed the Thebans to assault in strength the elite Spartan troops
    on the right flank of the opposing phalanx. \n\nMeanwhile, the centre and right
    flank of the Theban line were echeloned back, from the opposing phalanx, keeping
    the weakened parts of the formation from being engaged. \n\nOnce the Spartan
    right had been routed by the Theban left, the remainder of the Spartan line also
    broke. \n\nThus, by localising the attacking power of the hoplites, Epaminondas
    was able to defeat an enemy previously thought invincible.\nPhilip II of Macedon
    spent several years in Thebes as a hostage, and paid attention to Epaminondas'
    innovations. \n\nOn return to his homeland, he raised a revolutionary new infantry
    force, which was to change the face of the Greek world. \n\nPhilip's phalangites
    were the first force of professional soldiers seen in Ancient Greece apart from
    Sparta. \n\nThey were armed with longer spears (the sarissa) and were drilled
    more thoroughly in more evolved, complicated tactics and manoeuvres. \n\nMore
    importantly, though, Philip's phalanx was part of a multi-faceted, combined force
    that included a variety of skirmishers and cavalry, most notably the famous Companion
    cavalry. \n\nThe Macedonian phalanx now was used to pin the centre of the enemy
    line, while cavalry and more mobile infantry struck at the foe's flanks. \n\nIts
    supremacy over the more static armies fielded by the Greek city-states was shown
    at the Battle of Chaeronea, where Philip II's army crushed the allied Theban
    and Athenian phalanxes.\n\n\n== Weaknesses ==\n\nThe hoplite phalanx was weakest
    when facing an enemy fielding lighter and more flexible troops without its own
    such supporting troops. \n\nAn example of this would be the Battle of Lechaeum,
    where an Athenian contingent led by Iphicrates routed an entire Spartan mora
    (a unit of anywhere from 500 to 900 hoplites). \n\nThe Athenian force had a considerable
    proportion of light missile troops armed with javelins and bows that wore down
    the Spartans with repeated attacks, causing disarray in the Spartan ranks and
    an eventual rout when they spotted Athenian heavy infantry reinforcements trying
    to flank them by boat.\nThe Macedonian phalanx had weaknesses similar to its
    hoplitic predecessor. \n\nTheoretically indestructible from the front, its flanks
    and rear were very vulnerable, and once engaged it may not easily disengage or
    redeploy to face a threat from those directions. \n\nThus, a phalanx facing non-phalangite
    formations required some sort of protection on its flanks\u2014lighter or at
    least more mobile infantry, cavalry, etc. \n\nThis was shown at the Battle of
    Magnesia, where, once the Seleucid supporting cavalry elements were driven off,
    the phalanx was static and unable to go on the offensive against its Roman opponents
    (although they continued to resist stoutly and attempted a fighting withdrawal
    under a hail of Roman missiles, until the elephants posted on their flanks panicked
    and disrupted their formation).\nThe Macedonian phalanx could also lose its cohesion
    without proper coordination or while moving through broken terrain; doing so
    could create gaps between individual blocks/syntagmata, or could prevent a solid
    front within those sub-units as well, causing other sections of the line to bunch
    up. \n\nIn this event, as in the battles of Cynoscephalae and Pydna, the phalanx
    became vulnerable to attacks by more flexible units\u2014such as Roman legionary
    centuries, which were able to avoid the sarissae and engage in hand-to-hand combat
    with the phalangites.\nAnother important area that must be considered concerns
    the psychological tendencies of the hoplites. \n\nBecause the strength of a phalanx
    depended on the ability of the hoplites to maintain their frontline, it was crucial
    that a phalanx be able to quickly and efficiently replace fallen soldiers in
    the front ranks. \n\nIf a phalanx failed to do this in a structured manner, the
    opposing phalanx would have an opportunity to breach the line which, many times,
    would lead to a quick defeat. \n\nThis then implies that the hoplites ranks closer
    to the front must be mentally prepared to replace their fallen comrade and adapt
    to his new position without disrupting the structure of the frontline.Finally,
    most of the phalanx-centric armies tended to lack supporting echelons behind
    the main line of battle. \n\nThis meant that breaking through the line of battle
    or compromising one of its flanks often ensured victory.\n\n\n== Classical decline
    and post-classical use ==\n\nAfter reaching its zenith in the conquests of Alexander
    the Great, the phalanx began a slow decline, as Macedonian successor states declined.
    \n\nThe combined arms tactics used by Alexander and his father were gradually
    replaced by a return to the simpler frontal charge tactics of the hoplite phalanx.
    \n\nThe expense of the supporting arms and cavalry, and the widespread use of
    mercenaries, caused the Diadochi to rely on phalanx vs. phalanx tactics during
    the Wars of the Diadochi.\nThe decline of the Diadochi and the phalanx was linked
    with the rise of Rome and the Roman legions from the 3rd century BC. \n\nThe
    Battle of the Caudine Forks showed the clumsiness of the Roman phalanx against
    the Samnites. \n\nThe Romans had originally employed the phalanx themselves but
    gradually evolved more flexible tactics. \n\nThe result was the three-line Roman
    legion of the middle period of the Roman Republic, the Manipular System. \n\nRomans
    used a phalanx for their third military line, the triarii. \n\nThese were veteran
    reserve troops armed with the hastae or spear. \n\nRome conquered most of the
    Macedonian successor states. \n\nAlso the various Greek city-states and leagues.
    \n\nAs these states ceased to exist, so did the armies which used the traditional
    phalanx. \n\nSubsequently, troops from these regions were equipped, trained and
    fought using the Roman model.\nA phalanx formation called the phoulkon appeared
    in the late Roman army and Byzantine army. \n\nIt had characteristics of the
    classical Greek and Hellenistic phalanxes, but was more flexible. \n\nIt was
    used against cavalry more than infantry.\nHowever, the phalanx did not totally
    disappear. \n\nIn some battles between the Roman army and Hellenistic phalanxes,
    such as Pydna (168 BC), Cynoscephalae (197 BC) and Magnesia (190 BC), the phalanx
    performed well. \n\nIt even drove back the Roman infantry. \n\nHowever, at Cynoscephalae
    and Magnesia, failure to defend the flanks of the phalanx led to defeat. \n\nAt
    Pydna, the phalanx lost cohesion when pursuing retreating Roman soldiers. \n\nThis
    allowed the Romans to penetrate the formation. \n\nThen, Roman close combat skills
    proved decisive. \n\nThe historian Polybius details the effectiveness of the
    Roman legion against the phalanx. \n\nHe deduces that the Romans refused to fight
    the phalanx where the phalanx was effective, Romans offered battle only when
    a legion could exploit the clumsiness and immobility of a phalanx.\n\nSpear-armed
    troops continued to be important elements in many armies until reliable firearms
    became available. \n\nThese did not necessarily fight as a phalanx. \n\nFor example,
    compare the classical phalanx and late medieval pike formations.Military historians
    have suggested that the Scots under William Wallace and Robert the Bruce consciously
    imitated the Hellenistic phalanx to produce the Scots 'hedgehog' or schiltron.
    \n\nHowever, long spears might have been used by Picts and others in Scotlands'
    Early Middle Ages. \n\nPrior to 1066, long spear tactics (also found in North
    Wales) might have been part of irregular warfare in Britain. \n\nThe Scots used
    imported French pikes and dynamic tactics at the Battle of Flodden. \n\nHowever,
    Flodden found the Scots pitted against effective light artillery, while advancing
    over bad ground. \n\nThe combination disorganised the Scotts phalanxes and permitted
    effective attacks by English longbowmen, and soldiers wielding shorter, handier
    polearms called bills. \n\nSome contemporary sources might say that the bills
    cut off the heads of Scots pikes.\nThe pike was briefly reconsidered as a weapon
    by European armies in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. \n\nIt could protect
    riflemen, whose slower rate of fire made them vulnerable. \n\nA collapsible pike
    was invented but never issued. \n\nThe Confederate Army considered these for
    the American Civil War. \n\nSome were even manufactured but probably were never
    issued. \n\nPikes were manufactured during World War II as \"Croft's Pikes\".\nWhile
    obsolete in military practice, the phalanx remained in use as a metaphor of warriors
    moving forward as a single united block. \n\nThis metaphor inspired several 20th-century
    political movements, notably the Spanish Falange and its ideology of Falangism.\nThe
    Byzantines continued and improved the use of the classical Greek phalanx alongside
    the Macedonian-style phalanx. \n\nThe latter was based on a model that Alexander
    himself had created and had tried to give more importance to the skirmishers
    and cavalry, yet it never saw action until the Byzantines adopted the model that
    rely in a mixture of many units sometimes. \n\nMany writers of the age describe
    the spear as being a sarissa yet it was a meter short than the original sarissa
    and had being modified by the time, yet the term for the long spear remained
    alongside with its other names.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phalanx"

  descriptionText: "\n\nPISIFORM BONE\n\n\nThe pisiform bone ( or ), also spelled
    pisiforme (from the Latin pisifomis, pea-shaped), is a small knobbly, sesamoid
    bone that is found in the wrist. \n\nIt forms the ulnar border of the carpal
    tunnel.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe pisiform is a sesamoid bone, with no covering
    membrane of periosteum. \n\nIt is the last carpal bone to ossify. \n\nThe pisiform
    bone is a small bone found in the proximal row of the wrist (carpus). \n\nIt
    is situated where the ulna joins the wrist, within the tendon of the flexor carpi
    ulnaris muscle.\n\nIt only has one side that acts as a joint, articulating with
    the triquetral bone. \n\nIt is on a plane anterior to the other carpal bones
    and is spheroidal in form.\nThe pisiform bone has four surfaces:\n\nThe dorsal
    surface is smooth and oval, and articulates with the triquetral: this facet approaches
    the superior, but not the inferior border of the bone.\n\nThe palmar surface
    is rounded and rough, and gives attachment to the transverse carpal ligament,
    the flexor carpi ulnaris and the abductor digiti quinti.\n\nThe lateral surface
    is rough, and concave.\n\nThe medial surface' is rough and usually convex.\n\n\n==
    Etymology ==\n\nThe etymology derives from the Latin p\u012Bsum which means \"pea\"
    ultimately derived from the Greek \"pison\" (pea).\n\n\n== Function ==\n\nThe
    pisiform bone is most recognizable as an unassuming palmar projection forming
    the heel of your hand.\n\nThe pisiform bone, along with the hamulus of the hamate,
    defines the medial boundary of the carpal tunnel because the pisiform body acts
    as one of the four attachments points of the flexor retinaculum. \n\nIt also
    acts as an attachment site for tendons of the abductor digiti minimi and for
    the flexor carpi ulnaris - the tendon in which it develops. \n\nThe pisiform
    is the only carpal bone with insertions and attachments for the abductor digiti
    minimi and the flexor carpi ulnaris. \n\nIt is suggested that due to the pisiform's
    surprisingly large range of movement along its articulation surface with the
    triquetral bone (about 1 cm of movement is allowed), contraction of the flexor
    carpi ulnaris is necessary for the pisiform to remain stable enough for the abductor
    digiti minimi to function effectively.\n\nIn clinical studies, the pisiform has
    been removed as treatment for osteoarthritis in the pisotriquetral joint. \n\nWhile
    some studies came to the conclusion that the pisiform \"contributes to the stability
    of the ulnar column of the wrist\", others suggested that while excision slightly
    impairs the range of motion of the wrist (especially wrist extension), the forces
    generated within the wrist are not significantly impacted. \n\nSubjects in the
    latter study did report impaired function after excision when performing heavy
    lifting and weightbearing activities, but this is suggested to be subjective
    considering that they did not have to change occupation or their level of activity
    as a result of the excision.\n\n\n== Development ==\n\nCompared with other non-human
    primates, humans have a short pisiform bone. \n\nThis dramatic size difference
    is suggested to be the outcome of a lost growth plate in hominins some time between
    Australopithecus afarensis, who has been shown to have an elongated and ape-like
    pisiform, and Homo neanderthalensis, who is suggested to have a pisiform resembling
    the modern human condition.\n\nIt is suggested that the first signs of human
    pisiform ossification, observed between the ages of 7 and 12, corresponds to
    the period of secondary pisiform ossification in apes. \n\nThis can point to
    a couple different changes in development: either this growth plate loss in humans
    is also accompanied by a developmental shift in the timing of pisiform formation,
    or it is the primary center that fails to form in humans and as a result our
    pisiform is homologous to the epiphysis of other mammalian pisiforms.\n\nStudies
    looking at the effect of Hox gene knockouts on the formation of the pisiform
    in mice have suggested that the modification of Hoxa11 or Hoxd11 genes, or the
    downstream targets they affect, could have acted as the mechanism for the reduction
    we see in the human pisiform condition.\n\n\n== Evolution ==\n\nThere are several
    hypotheses that seek to explain why we see pisiform reduction during the course
    of hominin evolution. \n\nSome suggest that the reduction of the pisiform allowed
    for ulnar deviation and that allowed for greater extension in the human wrist
    which increased our capacity for throwing. \n\nScholars with this point of view
    would believe that these anatomical changes would improve the action of clubbing
    in our hominin ancestors.\nOthers suggest that the pisiform's link with Hoxa11
    and Hoxd11 could tie its developmental history to that of the forearm, whose
    length is determined by Hox gene expression. \n\nWithin the context of this hypothesis,
    because modern forearm proportions are not seen until Homo erectus at 1.5 million
    years ago, it is possible that pisiform reduction would have also occurred around
    this time. \n\nAlternatively, the same group suggests that the reduction could
    be a reflection of independent selection associated with the production and use
    of stone tools, but changes in pisiform morphology have yet to be studied in
    relation to their effect on wrist function.\n\n\n== Other animals ==\n\nAll other
    tetrapods have a pisiform, being the most common sesamoid. \n\nIn mammals and
    non-human primates, the pisiform is an enlarged and elongated bone that articulates
    with the distal ulna. \n\nIn some taxa, the pisiform even articulates with the
    hammate or radius. \n\nIn these non-human taxa, the pisiform develops from two
    ossification centers that are divided by a palmar epiphyseal plate. \n\nBecause

  descriptionText: "\n\nTIBIA\n\n\nThe tibia  (plural tibiae  or tibias), also known
    as the shinbone or shankbone, is the larger, stronger, and anterior (frontal)
    of the two bones in the leg below the knee in vertebrates (the other being the
    fibula, behind and to the outside of the tibia), and it connects the knee with
    the ankle bones. \n\nThe tibia is found on the medial side of the leg next to
    the fibula and closer to the median plane or centre-line. \n\nThe tibia is connected
    to the fibula by the interosseous membrane of leg, forming a type of fibrous
    joint called a syndesmosis with very little movement. \n\nThe tibia is named
    for the flute tibia. \n\nIt is the second largest bone in the human body next
    to the femur. \n\nThe leg bones are the strongest long bones as they support
    the rest of the body.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nIn human anatomy, the tibia is
    the second largest bone next to the femur. \n\nAs in other vertebrates the tibia
    is one of two bones in the lower leg, the other being the fibula, and is a component
    of the knee and ankle joints.\n\nThe ossification or formation of the bone starts
    from three centers; one in the shaft and one in each extremity.\n\nThe tibia
    is categorized as a long bone and is as such composed of a diaphysis and two
    epiphyses. \n\nThe diaphysis is the midsection of the tibia, also known as the
    shaft or body. \n\nWhile the epiphyses are the two rounded extremities of the
    bone; an upper (also known as superior or proximal) closest to the thigh and
    a lower (also known as inferior or distal) closest to the foot. \n\nThe tibia
    is most contracted in the lower third and the distal extremity is smaller than
    the proximal.\n\n\n=== Upper extremity ===\n\n==== Condyles of tibia ====\n\nThe
    proximal or upper extremity of the tibia is expanded in the transverse plane
    with a medial and lateral condyle, which are both flattened in the horizontal
    plane. \n\nThe medial condyle is the larger of the two and is better supported
    over the shaft. \n\nThe upper surfaces of the condyles articulate with the femur
    to form the tibiofemoral joint, the weightbearing part of the kneejoint.\n\nThe
    medial and lateral condyle are separated by the intercondylar area, where the
    cruciate ligaments and the menisci attach. \n\nHere the medial and lateral intercondylar
    tubercle forms the intercondylar eminence. \n\nTogether with the medial and lateral
    condyle the intercondylar region forms the tibial plateau, which both articulates
    with and is anchored to the lower extremity of the femur. \n\nThe intercondylar
    eminence divides the intercondylar area into an anterior and posterior part.
    \n\nThe anterolateral region of the anterior intercondylar area are perforated
    by numerous small openings for nutrient arteries.\n\nThe articular surfaces of
    both condyles are concave, particularly centrally. \n\nThe flatter outer margins
    are in contact with the menisci. \n\nThe medial condyles superior surface is
    oval in form and extends laterally onto the side of medial intercondylar tubercle.
    \n\nThe lateral condyles superior surface is more circular in form and its medial
    edge extends onto the side of the lateral intercondylar tubercle. \n\nThe posterior
    surface of the medial condyle bears a horizontal groove for part of the attachment
    of the semimembranosus muscle, whereas the lateral condyle has a circular facet
    for articulation with the head of the fibula.\n\nBeneath the condyles is the
    tibial tuberosity which serves for attachment of the patellar ligament, a continuation
    of the quadriceps femoris muscle.\n\n\n==== Facets ====\n\nThe superior articular
    surface presents two smooth articular facets.\n\nThe medial facet, oval in shape,
    is slightly concave from side to side, and from before backward.\n\nThe lateral,
    nearly circular, is concave from side to side, but slightly convex from before
    backward, especially at its posterior part, where it is prolonged on to the posterior
    surface for a short distance.\n\nThe central portions of these facets articulate
    with the condyles of the femur, while their peripheral portions support the menisci
    of the knee joint, which here intervene between the two bones.\n\n\n==== Intercondyloid
    eminence ====\n\nBetween the articular facets in the intercondylar area, but
    nearer the posterior than the anterior aspect of the bone, is the intercondyloid
    eminence (spine of tibia), surmounted on either side by a prominent tubercle,
    on to the sides of which the articular facets are prolonged; in front of and
    behind the intercondyloid eminence are rough depressions for the attachment of
    the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments and the menisci.\n\n\n==== Surfaces
    ====\n\nThe anterior surfaces of the condyles are continuous with one another,
    forming a large somewhat flattened area; this area is triangular, broad above,
    and perforated by large vascular foramina; narrow below where it ends in a large
    oblong elevation, the tuberosity of the tibia, which gives attachment to the
    patellar ligament; a bursa intervenes between the deep surface of the ligament
    and the part of the bone immediately above the tuberosity.\n\nPosteriorly, the
    condyles are separated from each other by a shallow depression, the posterior
    intercondyloid fossa, which gives attachment to part of the posterior cruciate
    ligament of the knee-joint. The medial condyle presents posteriorly a deep transverse
    groove, for the insertion of the tendon of the semimembranosus.\n\nIts medial
    surface is convex, rough, and prominent; it gives attachment to the medial collateral
    ligament.\nThe lateral condyle presents posteriorly a flat articular facet, nearly
    circular in form, directed downward, backward, and lateralward, for articulation
    with the head of the fibula. \n\nIts lateral surface is convex, rough, and prominent
    in front: on it is an eminence, situated on a level with the upper border of
    the tuberosity and at the junction of its anterior and lateral surfaces, for
    the attachment of the iliotibial band. \n\nJust below this a part of the extensor
    digitorum longus takes origin and a slip from the tendon of the biceps femoris
    is inserted.\n\n\n=== Shaft ===\n\nThe shaft or body of the tibia is triangular
    in cross-section and forms three borders: An anterior, medial and lateral or
    interosseous border. \n\nThese three borders form three surfaces; the medial,
    lateral and posterior.\n\nThe forward flat part of the tibia is called the fibia,
    often confused with the fibula.\n\n\n==== Borders ====\n\nThe anterior crest
    or border, the most prominent of the three, commences above at the tuberosity,
    and ends below at the anterior margin of the medial malleolus. \n\nIt is sinuous
    and prominent in the upper two-thirds of its extent, but smooth and rounded below;
    it gives attachment to the deep fascia of the leg.\n\nThe medial border is smooth
    and rounded above and below, but more prominent in the center; it begins at the
    back part of the medial condyle, and ends at the posterior border of the medial
    malleolus; its upper part gives attachment to the tibial collateral ligament
    of the knee-joint to the extent of about 5 cm., and insertion to some fibers
    of the popliteus muscle; from its middle third some fibers of the soleus and
    flexor digitorum longus muscles take origin.\n\nThe interosseous crest or lateral
    border is thin and prominent, especially its central part, and gives attachment
    to the interosseous membrane; it commences above in front of the fibular articular
    facet, and bifurcates below, to form the boundaries of a triangular rough surface,
    for the attachment of the interosseous ligament connecting the tibia and fibula.\n\n\n====
    Surfaces ====\n\nThe medial surface is smooth, convex, and broader above than
    below; its upper third, directed forward and medialward, is covered by the aponeurosis
    derived from the tendon of the sartorius, and by the tendons of the Gracilis
    and Semitendinosus, all of which are inserted nearly as far forward as the anterior
    crest; in the rest of its extent it is subcutaneous.\n\nThe lateral surface is
    narrower than the medial; its upper two-thirds present a shallow groove for the
    origin of the Tibialis anterior; its lower third is smooth, convex, curves gradually
    forward to the anterior aspect of the bone, and is covered by the tendons of
    the Tibialis anterior, Extensor hallucis longus, and Extensor digitorum longus,
    arranged in this order from the medial side.\n\nThe posterior surface presents,
    at its upper part, a prominent ridge, the popliteal line, which extends obliquely
    downward from the back part of the articular facet for the fibula to the medial
    border, at the junction of its upper and middle thirds; it marks the lower limit
    of the insertion of the Popliteus, serves for the attachment of the fascia covering
    this muscle, and gives origin to part of the Soleus, Flexor digitorum longus,
    and Tibialis posterior. \n\nThe triangular area, above this line, gives insertion
    to the Popliteus. \n\nThe middle third of the posterior surface is divided by
    a vertical ridge into two parts; the ridge begins at the popliteal line and is
    well-marked above, but indistinct below; the medial and broader portion gives
    origin to the Flexor digitorum longus, the lateral and narrower to part of the
    Tibialis posterior. \n\nThe remaining part of the posterior surface is smooth
    and covered by the Tibialis posterior, Flexor digitorum longus, and Flexor hallucis
    longus. Immediately below the popliteal line is the nutrient foramen, which is
    large and directed obliquely downward.\n\n\n=== Lower extremity ===\n\nThe distal
    end of the tibia is much smaller than the proximal end and presents five surfaces;
    it is prolonged downward on its medial side as a strong pyramidal process, the
    medial malleolus. \n\nThe lower extremity of the tibia together with the fibula
    and talus forms the ankle joint.\n\n\n==== Surfaces ====\n\nThe inferior articular
    surface is quadrilateral, and smooth for articulation with the talus. \n\nIt
    is concave from before backward, broader in front than behind, and traversed
    from before backward by a slight elevation, separating two depressions. \n\nIt
    is continuous with that on the medial malleolus.\n\nThe anterior surface of the
    lower extremity is smooth and rounded above, and covered by the tendons of the
    Extensor muscles; its lower margin presents a rough transverse depression for
    the attachment of the articular capsule of the ankle-joint.\n\nThe posterior
    surface is traversed by a shallow groove directed obliquely downward and medialward,
    continuous with a similar groove on the posterior surface of the talus and serving
    for the passage of the tendon of the Flexor hallucis longus.\n\nThe lateral surface
    presents a triangular rough depression for the attachment of the inferior interosseous
    ligament connecting it with the fibula; the lower part of this depression is
    smooth, covered with cartilage in the fresh state, and articulates with the fibula.
    \n\nThe surface is bounded by two prominent borders (the anterior and posterior
    colliculi), continuous above with the interosseous crest; they afford attachment
    to the anterior and posterior ligaments of the lateral malleolus.\n\nThe medial
    surface -- see medial malleolus for details.\n\n\n==== Fractures ====\n\nAnkle
    fractures of the tibia have several classification systems based on location
    or mechanism:\n\nMedial malleolus - Herscovici classification\nPosterior malleolus
    - Haruguchi classification\nMechanism - Lauge-Hansen classification\n\n\n===
    Blood supply ===\n\nThe tibia is supplied with blood from two sources: A nutrient
    artery, as the main source, and periosteal vessels derived from the anterior
    tibial artery.\n\n\n=== Joints ===\n\nThe tibia is a part of four joints; the
    knee, ankle, superior and inferior tibiofibular joint.\n\nIn the knee the tibia
    forms one of the two articulations with the femur, often referred to as the tibiofemoral
    components of the knee joint. \n\nThis is the weightbearing part of the knee
    joint.\n\nThe tibiofibular joints are the articulations between the tibia and
    fibula which allows very little movement.\n\nThe proximal tibiofibular joint
    is a small plane joint. \n\nThe joint is formed between the undersurface of the
    lateral tibial condyle and the head of fibula. \n\nThe joint capsule is reinforced
    by anterior and posterior ligament of the head of the fibula.\n\nThe distal tibiofibular
    joint (tibiofibular syndesmosis) is formed by the rough, convex surface of the
    medial side of the distal end of the fibula, and a rough concave surface on the
    lateral side of the tibia.\n\nThe part of the ankle joint known as the talocrural
    joint, is a synovial hinge joint that connects the distal ends of the tibia and
    fibula in the lower limb with the proximal end of the talus. \n\nThe articulation
    between the tibia and the talus bears more weight than between the smaller fibula
    and the talus.\n\n\n=== Development ===\n\nThe tibia is ossified from three centers;
    a primary center for the diaphysis (shaft) and a secondary center for each epiphysis
    (extremity). Ossification begins in the center of the body, about the seventh
    week of fetal life, and gradually extends toward the extremities.\n\nThe center
    for the upper epiphysis appears before or shortly after birth at close to 34
    weeks gestation; it is flattened in form, and has a thin tongue-shaped process
    in front, which forms the tuberosity; that for the lower epiphysis appears in
    the second year.\n\nThe lower epiphysis fuses with the tibial shaft at about
    the eighteenth, and the upper one fuses about the twentieth year.\n\nTwo additional
    centers occasionally exist, one for the tongue-shaped process of the upper epiphysis,
    which forms the tuberosity, and one for the medial malleolus.\n\n\n== Function
    ==\n\n=== Muscle attachments ===\n\n=== Strength ===\n\nThe tibia has been modeled
    as taking an axial force during walking that is up to 4.7 bodyweight. \n\nIts
    bending moment in the sagittal plane in the late stance phase is up to 71.6 bodyweight
    times millimetre.\n\n\n== Clinical significance ==\n\n=== Fracture ===\n\nFractures
    of the tibia can be divided into those that only involve the tibia; bumper fracture,
    Segond fracture, Gosselin fracture, toddler's fracture, and those including both
    the tibia and fibula; trimalleolar fracture, bimalleolar fracture, Pott's fracture.\n\n\n==
    Society and culture ==\n\nIn Judaism, the tibia, or shankbone, of a goat is used
    in the Passover Seder plate.\n\n\n== Other animals ==\n\nThe structure of the
    tibia in most other tetrapods is essentially similar to that in humans. \n\nThe
    tuberosity of the tibia, a crest to which the patellar ligament attaches in mammals,
    is instead the point for the tendon of the quadriceps muscle in reptiles, birds,
    and amphibians, which have no patella.\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibia"

  descriptionText: "\n\nCANINE TOOTH\n\n\nIn mammalian oral anatomy, the canine teeth,
    also called cuspids, dog teeth, or (in the context of the upper jaw) fangs, eye
    teeth, vampire teeth, or vampire fangs, are the relatively long, pointed teeth.
    \n\nThey can appear more flattened however, causing them to resemble incisors
    and leading them to be called incisiform. \n\nThey developed and are used primarily
    for firmly holding food in order to tear it apart, and occasionally as weapons.
    \n\nThey are often the largest teeth in a mammal's mouth. \n\nIndividuals of
    most species that develop them normally have four, two in the upper jaw and two
    in the lower, separated within each jaw by incisors; humans and dogs are examples.
    \n\nIn most species, canines are the anterior-most teeth in the maxillary bone.
    \nThe four canines in humans are the two maxillary canines and the two mandibular
    canines.\n\n\n== Details ==\n\nThere are four canine teeth: two in the upper
    (maxillary) and two in the lower (mandibular) arch. \n\nA canine is placed laterally
    to each lateral incisor and mesial to the premolars. \n\nThey are larger and
    stronger than the incisors, and their roots sink deeply into the bones, and cause
    well-marked prominences upon the surface. \n\nThey are the only teeth in dentition
    with a single cusp, their crowns are roughly triangular from mesial view and
    trapezoidal in buccal view.\n\nThe crown is large and conical, very convex on
    its labial surface, a little hollowed and uneven on its lingual surface, and
    tapering to a blunted point or cusp, which projects beyond the level of the other
    teeth. \n\nThe root is single, but longer and thicker than that of the incisors,
    conical in form, compressed laterally, and marked by a slight groove on each
    side. \n\nThe lingual surface also presents two depressions on either side of
    the surface separated by a ridge in between; these depressions are known as mesial
    and distal lingual fossae.\n\n\n=== Eruption ===\n\nIn humans, the upper canine
    teeth (popularly called eye teeth, from their position under the eyes) are larger
    and longer than the lower, and usually present a distinct basal ridge. \n\nEruption
    typically occurs between the ages of eleven and twelve years for upper canines
    and between nine and ten years for lower canines. \n\nUpper deciduous canines
    also known as the baby tooth, typically erupt between ages of sixteen and twenty-two
    months and sheds between ten and twelve years. \n\nLower deciduous canines typically
    erupt between ages of seventeen and twenty-two months and sheds between nine
    to twelve years \n\n\n=== Developmental defects ===\n\nTransposition (positional
    interchange of two adjacent teeth) is a development defect that most commonly
    found in the permanent canine, with the maxillary being more commonly seen than
    mandibular. \n\nThe upper canine frequently transposed with the first premolar
    whilst the lower canine transposed with the lateral incisor. \n\nOccasionally
    canines are congenitally missing.\n\n\n=== Maxillary canine morphology ===\n\nFrom
    a facial aspect, maxillary canines are approximately one millimetre narrower
    than the central incisor. \n\nTheir mesial aspects resemble the adjacent lateral
    incisors, while their distal aspects anticipate the first premolars. \n\nThey
    are slightly darker and more yellow in color than the other anterior teeth. \n\nFrom
    a lingual aspect, they have well developed mesial and distal marginal ridges
    and a well-developed cingulum. \n\nA prominent lingual ridge divides the lingual
    aspect in half and creates the mesial and distal lingual fossae between the lingual
    ridge and the marginal ridges. \n\nFrom a proximal aspect, they resemble the
    incisors, but are more robust, especially in the cingulum region. \n\nIncisally,
    they are visibly asymmetrical, as the mesial incisal edge is slightly shorter
    than the distal incisal edge, which places the cusp slightly mesial to the long
    axis of the tooth. \n\nThey are also thicker labiolingually than mesiodistally.
    \n\nBecause of the disproportionate incisal edges, the contacts are also asymmetrical.
    \n\nMesially, the contact sits at the junction of the incisal and middle third
    of the crown, while distally, the contact as more cervical, in the middle of
    the middle third of the crown.The root of the maxillary canines are the longest
    root of any tooth and conical in shape.\n\n\n=== Mandibular canine morphology
    ===\n\nThe lower canine teeth are placed nearer the middle line than the upper,
    so that their summits correspond to the intervals between the upper canines and
    the lateral incisors. \n\nFrom a facial aspect, the mandibular canine is notably
    narrower mesiodistally than the maxillary one, the root is compressed mesiodistally
    with well-marked grooves on both sides and may be just as long as the maxillary
    (and at times bifurcated). \n\nA distinctive feature is the nearly straight outline
    this tooth has compared to the maxillary canine which is slightly more bowed.
    \n\nAs in the maxillary canine, the mesial incisal edge (or cusp ridge) is shorter
    than the distal side, however, the cusp is displaced slightly lingual relative
    to the cusp of the maxillary canine.\n\nLingually, the surface of the tooth is
    much smoother compared to the very pronounced surface of the maxillary canine,
    and the cingulum is noted as less developed. \n\nThe cusp may be lost with attrition
    over time and may resemble an upper second permanent incisor.\n\n\n== Sexual
    dimorphism ==\n\nWith many species, the canine teeth in the upper or lower jaw,
    or in both, are much larger in the males than in the females, or are absent in
    females, except sometimes a hidden rudiment. \n\nCertain antelopes, the musk-deer,
    camel, horse, boar, various apes, seals, and the walrus, offer instances.\n\n\n==
    In non-synapsids ==\n\nIn non-synapsids (\"mammal-like reptiles\"), teeth similar
    to canines may be termed \"caniniform\" (\"canine-shaped\") teeth.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canine_tooth"

  descriptionText: "\n\nLUMBAR VERTEBRAE\n\n\nThe lumbar vertebrae are, in human
    anatomy, the five vertebrae between the rib cage and the pelvis. \n\nThey are
    the largest segments of the vertebral column and are characterized by the absence
    of the foramen transversarium within the transverse process (since it is only
    found in the cervical region) and by the absence of facets on the sides of the
    body (as found only in the thoracic region). \n\nThey are designated L1 to L5,
    starting at the top. \n\nThe lumbar vertebrae help support the weight of the
    body, and permit movement.\n\n\n== Human anatomy ==\n\n=== General characteristics
    ===\n\nThe figure on the left depicts the general characteristics of the first
    through fourth lumbar vertebrae. \n\nThe fifth vertebra contains certain peculiarities,
    which are detailed below.\n\nAs with other vertebrae, each lumbar vertebra consists
    of a vertebral body and a vertebral arch. \n\nThe vertebral arch, consisting
    of a pair of pedicles and a pair of laminae, encloses the vertebral foramen (opening)
    and supports seven processes.\n\n\n==== Body ====\n\nThe vertebral body of each
    lumbar vertebra is kidney shaped, wider from side to side than from front to
    back, and a little thicker in front than in back. \n\nIt is flattened or slightly
    concave above and below, concave behind, and deeply constricted in front and
    at the sides.\n\n\n==== Arch ====\n\nThe pedicles are very strong, directed backward
    from the upper part of the vertebral body; consequently, the inferior vertebral
    notches are of considerable depth. \n\nThe pedicles change in morphology from
    the upper lumbar to the lower lumbar. \n\nThey increase in sagittal width from
    9 mm to up to 18 mm at L5. \n\nThey increase in angulation in the axial plane
    from 10 degrees to 20 degrees by L5. \n\nThe pedicle is sometimes used as a portal
    of entrance into the vertebral body for fixation with pedicle screws or for placement
    of bone cement as with kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty.\n\nThe laminae are broad,
    short, and strong. \n\nThey form the posterior portion of the vertebral arch.
    \n\nIn the upper lumbar region the lamina are taller than wide but in the lower
    lumbar vertebra the lamina are wider than tall. \n\nThe lamina connects the spinous
    process to the pedicles.\nThe vertebral foramen within the arch is triangular,
    larger than the thoracic vertebrae, but smaller than in the cervical vertebrae.\n\n\n====
    Processes ====\n\nThe spinous process is thick, broad, and somewhat quadrilateral;
    it projects backward and ends in a rough, uneven border, thickest below where
    it is occasionally notched.The superior and inferior articular processes are
    well-defined, projecting respectively upward and downward from the junctions
    of pedicles and laminae. \n\nThe facets on the superior processes are concave,
    and look backward and medialward; those on the inferior are convex, and are directed
    forward and lateralward. \n\nThe former are wider apart than the latter since
    in the articulated column, the inferior articular processes are embraced by the
    superior processes of the subjacent vertebra.The transverse processes are long
    and slender. \n\nThey are horizontal in the upper three lumbar vertebrae and
    incline a little upward in the lower two. \n\nIn the upper three vertebrae they
    arise from the junctions of the pedicles and laminae, but in the lower two they
    are set farther forward and spring from the pedicles and posterior parts of the
    vertebral bodies. \n\nThey are situated in front of the articular processes instead
    of behind them as in the thoracic vertebrae, and are homologous with the ribs.\n\nThree
    portions or tubercles can be noticed in a transverse process of a lower lumbar
    vertebrae: the lateral or costiform process, the mammillary process, and the
    accessory process. \n\nThe costiform is lateral, the mammillary is superior (cranial),
    and the accessory is inferior (caudal). \n\nThe mammillary is connected in the
    lumbar region with the back part of the superior articular process. \n\nThe accessory
    process is situated at the back part of the base of the transverse process. \n\nThe
    tallest and thickest costiform process is usually that of L5.\n\n\n=== First
    and fifth lumbar vertebrae ===\n\n\nThe first lumbar vertebra is level with the
    anterior end of the ninth rib. \n\nThis level is also called the important transpyloric
    plane, since the pylorus of the stomach is at this level. \n\nOther important
    structures are also located at this level, they include; fundus of the gall bladder,
    celiac trunk, superior mesenteric artery, termination of spinal cord, beginning
    of filum terminalis, renal vessels, middle suprarenal arteries, and hila of kidneys.\n\nThe
    fifth lumbar vertebra is characterized by its body being much deeper in front
    than behind, which accords with the prominence of the sacrovertebral articulation;
    by the smaller size of its spinous process; by the wide interval between the
    inferior articular processes, and by the thickness of its transverse processes,
    which spring from the body as well as from the pedicles.\n\nThe fifth lumbar
    vertebra is by far the most common site of spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis.Most
    individuals have five lumbar vertebrae, while some have four or six. \n\nLumbar
    disorders that normally affect L5 will affect L4 or L6 in these latter individuals.\n\n\n===
    Segmental movements ===\n\nThe range of segmental movements in a single segment
    is difficult to measure clinically, not only because of variations between individuals,
    but also because it is age and sex dependent. \n\nFurthermore, flexion and extension
    in the lumbal spine is the product of a combination of rotation and translation
    in the sagittal plane between each vertebra.Ranges of segmental movements in
    the lumbar spine (White and Punjabi, 1990) are (in degrees):\n\n\n=== Congenital
    anomalies ===\n\nCongenital vertebral anomalies can cause compression of the
    spinal cord by deforming the vertebral canal or causing instability.\n\n\n==
    Other animals ==\n\nAfrican apes have three and four lumbar vertebrae, (bonobos
    have longer spines with an additional vertebra) and humans normally five. \n\nThis
    difference, and because the lumbar spines of the extinct Nacholapithecus (a Miocene
    hominoid with six lumbar vertebrae and no tail) are similar to those of early
    Australopithecus and early Homo, it is assumed that the Chimpanzee-human last
    common ancestor also had a long vertebral column with a long lumbar region and
    that the reduction in the number of lumbar vertebrae evolved independently in
    each ape clade.\n\nThe limited number of lumbar vertebrae in chimpanzees and
    gorillas result in an inability to lordose (curve) their lumbar spines, in contrast
    to the spines of Old World monkeys and Nacholapithecus and Proconsul, which suggests
    that the last common ancestor was not \"short-backed\" as previously believed.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumbar_vertebrae"

  descriptionText: "\n\nCLAVICLE\n\n\nThe clavicle, or collarbone, is a slender,
    S-shaped long bone approximately 6 inches (15 cm) long that serves as a strut
    between the shoulder blade and the sternum (breastbone).\n\nThere are two clavicles,
    one on the left and one on the right.\n\nThe clavicle is the only long bone in
    the body that lies horizontally.\nTogether with the shoulder blade, it makes
    up the shoulder girdle.\n\nIt is a touchable bone, and in people who have less
    fat in this region, the location of the bone is clearly visible, as it creates
    a bulge in the skin.\n\nIt receives its name from the Latin clavicula (\"little
    key\"), because the bone rotates along its axis like a key when the shoulder
    is abducted.\n\nThe clavicle is the most commonly fractured bone.\n\nIt can easily
    be fractured by impacts to the shoulder from the force of falling on outstretched
    arms or by a direct hit.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe collarbone is a thin doubly
    curved long bone that connects the arm to the trunk of the body.\n\nLocated directly
    above the first rib, it acts as a strut to keep the scapula in place so that
    the arm can hang freely.\n\nAt its rounded medial end (sternal end), it articulates
    with the manubrium of the sternum (breastbone) at the sternoclavicular joint.\n\nAt
    its flattened lateral end (acromial end), it articulates with the acromion, a
    process of the scapula (shoulder blade), at the acromioclavicular joint.\n\nThe
    rounded medial region (sternal region) of the shaft has a long curve laterally
    and anteriorly along two-thirds of the entire shaft.\n\nThe flattened lateral
    region (acromial region) of the shaft has an even larger posterior curve to articulate
    with the acromion of the scapula.\n\nThe medial region is the longest clavicular
    region as it takes up two-thirds of the entire shaft.\n\nThe lateral region is
    both the widest clavicular region and thinnest clavicular region.\n\nThe lateral
    end has a rough inferior surface that bears a ridge, the trapezoid line, and
    a slight rounded projection, the conoid tubercle (above the coracoid process).\n\nThese
    surface features are attachment sites for muscles and ligaments of the shoulder.\n\nIt
    can be divided into three parts: medial end, lateral end, and shaft.\n\n\n===
    Medial end ===\n\nThe medial end is also known as the sternal end.\n\nIt is quadrangular
    and articulates with the clavicular notch of the manubrium of the sternum to
    form the sternoclavicular joint.\n\nThe articular surface extends to the inferior
    aspect for articulation with the first costal cartilage.\n\n\n=== Lateral end
    ===\n\nThe lateral end is also known as the acromial end.\n\nIt is flat from
    above downward.\n\nIt bears a facet that articulates with the shoulder to form
    the acromioclavicular joint.\n\nThe area surrounding the joint gives an attachment
    to the joint capsule.\n\nThe anterior border is concave forward and the posterior
    border is convex backward.\n\n\n=== Shaft ===\n\nThe shaft is divided into two
    main regions, the medial region, and the lateral region.\n\nThe medial region
    is also known as the sternal region, it is the longest clavicular region as it
    takes up two-thirds of the entire shaft.\n\nThe lateral region is also known
    as the acromial region, it is both the widest clavicular region and thinnest
    clavicular region.\n\n\n==== Lateral region of the shaft ====\n\nThe lateral
    region of the shaft has two borders and two surfaces.\n\n-the anterior border
    is concave forward and gives origin to the deltoid muscle.\n-the posterior border
    is convex and gives attachment to the trapezius muscle.\n-the inferior surface
    has a ridge called the trapezoid line and a tubercle; the conoid tubercle for
    attachment with the trapezoid and the conoid ligament, part of the coracoclavicular
    ligament that serves to connect the collarbone with the coracoid process of the
    scapula.\n\n\n=== Development ===\n\nThe collarbone is the first bone to begin
    the process of ossification (laying down of minerals onto a preformed matrix)
    during development of the embryo, during the fifth and sixth weeks of gestation.\n\nHowever,
    it is one of the last bones to finish ossification at about 21\u201325 years
    of age.\n\nIts lateral end is formed by intramembranous ossification while medially
    it is formed by endochondral ossification.\n\nIt consists of a mass of cancellous
    bone surrounded by a compact bone shell.\n\nThe cancellous bone forms via two
    ossification centres, one medial and one lateral, which fuse later on.\n\nThe
    compact forms as the layer of fascia covering the bone stimulate the ossification
    of adjacent tissue.\n\nThe resulting compact bone is known as a periosteal collar.\n\nEven
    though it is classified as a long bone, the collarbone has no medullary cavity 
    (marrow cavity) like other long bones, though this is not always true.\n\nIt
    is made up of spongy cancellous bone with a shell of compact bone.\n\nIt is a
    dermal bone derived from elements originally attached to the skull.\n\n\n===
    Variation ===\n\nThe shape of the clavicle varies more than most other long bones.\n\nIt
    is occasionally pierced by a branch of the supraclavicular nerve.\n\nIn males
    the clavicle is usually longer and larger than in females.\n\nA study measuring
    748 males and 252 females saw a difference in collarbone length between age groups
    18\u201320 and 21\u201325 of about 6 and 5 mm (0.24 and 0.20 in) for males and
    females respectively.\n\nThe left clavicle is usually longer and weaker than
    the right clavicle.\n\nThe collarbones are sometimes partly or completely absent
    in cleidocranial dysostosis.\n\nThe levator claviculae muscle, present in 2\u20133%
    of people, originates on the transverse processes of the upper cervical vertebrae
    and is inserted in the lateral half of the clavicle.\n\n\n== Functions ==\n\nThe
    collarbone serves several functions:\n    \nIt serves as a rigid support from
    which the scapula and free limb suspended; an arrangement that keeps the upper
    limb away from the thorax so that the arm has maximum range of movement.\n\nActing
    as a flexible, crane-like strut, it allows the scapula to move freely on the
    thoracic wall.\n\nCovering the cervicoaxillary canal, it protects the neurovascular
    bundle that supplies the upper limb.\n\nTransmits physical impacts from the upper
    limb to the axial skeleton.\n\n\n=== Muscle ===\n\nMuscles and ligaments that
    attach to the collarbone include:\n\n\n== Clinical significance ==\n\n-Acromioclavicular
    dislocation (\"AC Separation\")\n-Degeneration of the clavicle\n-Osteolysis\n-Sternoclavicular
    dislocationsA vertical line drawn from the mid-clavicle called the mid-clavicular
    line is used as a reference in describing cardiac apex beat during medical examination.\n-It
    is also useful for evaluating an enlarged liver, and for locating the gallbladder
    which is between the mid-clavicular line and the transpyloric plane.\n\n\n===
    Collarbone fracture ===\n\nClavicle fractures (colloquially, a broken collarbone)
    occur as a result of injury or trauma.\n\nThe most common type of fractures occur
    when a person falls horizontally on the shoulder or with an outstretched hand.\n\nA
    direct hit to the collarbone will also cause a break.\n\nIn most cases, the direct
    hit occurs from the lateral side towards the medial side of the bone.\n\nThe
    most common site of fracture is the junction between the two curvatures of the
    bone, which is the weakest point.\n\nThis results in the sternocleidomastoid
    muscle lifting the medial aspect superiorly, which can result in perforation
    of the overlying skin.\n\n\n== Other animals ==\n\nThe clavicle first appears
    as part of the skeleton in primitive bony fish, where it is associated with the
    pectoral fin; they also have a bone called the cleithrum.\n\nIn such fish, the
    paired clavicles run behind and below the gills on each side, and are joined
    by a solid symphysis on the fish's underside.\n\nThey are, however, absent in
    cartilaginous fish and in the vast majority of living bony fish, including all
    of the teleosts.\n\nThe earliest tetrapods retained this arrangement, with the
    addition of a diamond-shaped interclavicle between the base of the clavicles,
    although this is not found in living amphibians.\n\nThe cleithrum disappeared
    early in the evolution of reptiles, and is not found in any living amniotes,
    but the interclavicle is present in most modern reptiles, and also in monotremes.\n\nIn
    modern forms, however, there are a number of variations from the primitive pattern.\n\nFor
    example, crocodilians and salamanders lack clavicles altogether (although crocodilians
    do retain the interclavicle), while in turtles, they form part of the armoured
    plastron.The interclavicle is absent in marsupials and placental mammals.\n\nIn
    many mammals, the clavicles are also reduced, or even absent, to allow the scapula
    greater freedom of motion, which may be useful in fast-running animals.\n\nThough
    a number of fossil hominin (humans and chimpanzees) clavicles have been found,
    most of these are mere segments offering limited information on the form and
    function of the pectoral girdle.\n\nOne exception is the clavicle of AL 333x6/9
    attributed to Australopithecus afarensis which has a well-preserved sternal end.\n\nOne
    interpretation of this specimen, based on the orientation of its lateral end
    and the position of the deltoid attachment area, suggests that this clavicle
    is distinct from those found in extant apes (including humans), and thus that
    the shape of the human shoulder dates back to less than 3 to 4 million years
    ago.\n\nHowever, analyses of the clavicle in extant primates suggest that the
    low position of the scapula in humans is reflected mostly in the curvature of
    the medial portion of the clavicle rather than the lateral portion.\n\nThis part
    of the bone is similar in A.afarensis and it is thus possible that this species
    had a high shoulder position similar to that in modern humans.\n\n\n=== In dinosaurs
    ===\n\nIn dinosaurs the main bones of the pectoral girdle were the scapula (shoulder
    blade) and the coracoid, both of which directly articulated with the clavicle.\n\nThe
    clavicle was present in saurischian dinosaurs but largely absent in ornithischian
    dinosaurs.\n\nThe place on the scapula where it articulated with the humerus
    (upper bone of the forelimb) is the called the glenoid.\n\nThe clavicles fused
    in some theropod dinosaurs to form a furcula, which is the equivalent to a wishbone.In
    birds, the clavicles and interclavicle have fused to form a single Y-shaped bone,
    the furcula or \"wishbone\" which evolved from the clavicles found in coelurosaurian
    theropods.\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clavicle"

  descriptionText: "\n\nCAPITATE BONE\n\n\nThe capitate bone is found in the center
    of the carpal bone region, colloquially known as the wrist, which is at the distal
    end of the radius and ulna bones. \n\nIt articulates with the third metacarpal
    bone (the middle finger) and forms the third carpometacarpal joint. \n\nThe capitate
    bone is the largest of the carpal bones in the human hand. \n\nIt presents, above,
    a rounded portion or head, which is received into the concavity formed by the
    scaphoid and lunate bones; a constricted portion or neck; and below this, the
    body.\n\nThe bone is also found in many other mammals, and is homologous with
    the \"third distal carpal\" of reptiles and amphibians.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe
    capitate is the largest carpal bone found within the hand. \n\nThe capitate is
    found within the distal row of carpal bones. \n\nThe capitate lies directly adjacent
    to the metacarpal of the ring finger on its distal surface, has the hamate on
    its ulnar surface and trapezoid on its radial surface, and abuts the lunate and
    scaphoid proximally. \n\n\n=== Surfaces ===\n\nThe superior surface is round,
    smooth, and articulates with the lunate bone.\n\nThe inferior surface is divided
    by two ridges into three facets, for articulation with the second, third, and
    fourth metacarpal bones, that for the third being the largest.\n\nThe dorsal
    surface is broad and rough.The palmar surface is narrow, rounded, and rough,
    for the attachment of ligaments and a part of the adductor pollicis muscle.\n\nThe
    lateral surface articulates with the lesser multangular by a small facet at its
    anterior inferior angle, behind which is a rough depression for the attachment
    of an interosseous ligament. \n\nAbove this is a deep, rough groove, forming
    part of the neck, and serving for the attachment of ligaments; it is bounded
    superiorly by a smooth, convex surface, for articulation with the scaphoid bone.\n\nThe
    medial surface articulates with the hamate bone by a smooth, concave, oblong
    facet, which occupies its posterior and superior parts; it is rough in front,
    for the attachment of an interosseous ligament.\n\n\n=== Variation ===\n\nThe
    capitate bone variably articulates with the metacarpal of the index finger. \n\nHowever,
    its normal articulation is with the middle finger.\n\n\n=== Development ===\n\nThe
    ossification of capitate starts at 1 \u2013 5 months.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\nThe
    carpal bones function as a unit to provide a bony superstructure for the hand.
    :\u200A708\u200A They allow movements of the wrist from side to side (medial
    to lateral) as well as up and down (anterior to posterior). \n\n\nHarris wrote
    in the British Medical Journal in 1944 that \"the strength of construction of
    the hand in a man is concentrated in the radius, thumb, and index and middle
    fingers.\" \n\nTherefore, the capitate is larger to support the strength and
    stress that the middle finger undergoes.\n\n\n== Clinical significance ==\n\nA
    capitate fracture accounts for 1.3% of all wrist fractures. \n\nIsolated fractures
    of the capitate comprise only 0.3% and are often non-displace. \n\nThis is since
    the capitate is at the centre of the carpal region and is therefore quite well
    protected.\n\nCapitate fractures occur together with fractures of another carpal
    bone, the scaphoid.\n\nVarious mechanisms for fractures of the capitate have
    been postulated. \n\nAdler et al. described three mechanisms\u2014the first is
    direct trauma to the dorsal surface of the bone, the second is fall on the palm
    with the wrist in forced extension and the third is fall on the forcefully flexed
    hand; the second being the most frequent and the third rarest.\n\nIn the case
    of an acute capitate fracture where there is x-ray evidence of excellent alignment
    of the fracture fragments, the attending doctor will immobilise the wrist in
    a plaster or lightweight wrist brace. \n\nOnce the cast has been removed the
    patient begins physiotherapy to regain the range of movement of the wrist joint
    and strength in the muscles involved.\n\nIf x-rays show that the capitate fracture
    fragments are out of alignment, surgery is indicated. \n\nA surgeon can use small
    compression screws or K-wires to unite the two pieces of bone. \n\nThe headless
    compression screw has advantage over the K-wire as it provides compression across
    the fracture site and allows early motion. \n\nIt may be the case that the ligament
    between the \u0441apitate and the scaphoid bone is also injured; if so, this
    would be repaired at the same time.\n\nBecause the capitate has a poor blood
    supply there are sometimes complications with the healing process. \n\nThis may
    manifest itself as a diffuse ache in the wrist upon activity, and can persist
    for many months. \n\nThis is due to a breakdown of the capitate caused by the
    lack of blood supply and healing (avascular necrosis). \n\nNonunion has been
    reported as the most common complication; 19.6% to 56% in isolated capitate fractures.
    \n\nEarly diagnosis is key to preventing this.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe etymology
    derives from the Latin Latin: capit\u0101tus, \"having a head,\" from Latin:
    capit-, meaning \"head.\"\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitate_bone"

  descriptionText: "\n\nCERVICAL VERTEBRAE\n\n\nIn tetrapods, cervical vertebrae
    (singular: vertebra) are the vertebrae of the neck, immediately below the skull.
    \n\nTruncal vertebrae (divided into thoracic and lumbar vertebrae in mammals)
    lie caudal (toward the tail) of cervical vertebrae. \n\nIn sauropsid species,
    the cervical vertebrae bear cervical ribs. \n\nIn lizards and saurischian dinosaurs,
    the cervical ribs are large; in birds, they are small and completely fused to
    the vertebrae. \n\nThe vertebral transverse processes of mammals are homologous
    to the cervical ribs of other amniotes. \n\nMost mammals have seven cervical
    vertebrae, with the only three known exceptions being the manatee with six, the
    two-toed sloth with five or six, and the three-toed sloth with nine.\n\nIn humans,
    cervical vertebrae are the smallest of the true vertebrae and can be readily
    distinguished from those of the thoracic or lumbar regions by the presence of
    a foramen (hole) in each transverse process, through which the vertebral artery,
    vertebral veins, and inferior cervical ganglion pass. \n\nThe remainder of this
    article focuses upon human anatomy.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\n\nBy convention,
    the cervical vertebrae are numbered, with the first one (C1) closest to the skull
    and higher numbered vertebrae (C2\u2013C7) proceeding away from the skull and
    down the spine.\n\nThe general characteristics of the third through sixth cervical
    vertebrae are described here. \n\nThe first, second, and seventh vertebrae are
    extraordinary, and are detailed later.\n\nThe bodies of these four vertebrae
    are small, and broader from side to side than from front to back.\n\nThe anterior
    and posterior surfaces are flattened and of equal depth; the former is placed
    on a lower level than the latter, and its inferior border is prolonged downward,
    so as to overlap the upper and forepart of the vertebra below.\n\nThe upper surface
    is concave transversely, and presents a projecting lip on either side.\n\nThe
    lower surface is concave from front to back, convex from side to side, and presents
    laterally shallow concavities that receive the corresponding projecting lips
    of the underlying vertebra.\n\nThe pedicles are directed laterally and backward,
    and attach to the body midway between its upper and lower borders, so that the
    superior vertebral notch is as deep as the inferior, but it is, at the same time,
    narrower.\n\nThe laminae are narrow and thinner above than below; the vertebral
    foramen is large and of a triangular form.\nThe spinous process is short and
    bifid, the two divisions being often of unequal size. \n\nBecause the spinous
    processes are so short, certain superficial muscles (the trapezius and splenius
    capitis) attach to the nuchal ligament rather than directly to the vertebrae;
    the nuchal ligament itself attaching to the spinous processes of C2\u2013C7 and
    to the posterior tubercle of the atlas.\n\nThe superior and inferior articular
    processes of cervical vertebrae have fused on either or both sides to form articular
    pillars, columns of bone that project laterally from the junction of the pedicle
    and lamina.\n\nThe articular facets are flat and of an oval form:\nthe superior
    face backward, upward, and slightly medially.\nthe inferior face forward, downward,
    and slightly laterally.\n\nThe transverse processes are each pierced by the foramen
    transversarium, which, in the upper six vertebrae, gives passage to the vertebral
    artery and vein, as well as a plexus of sympathetic nerves. \n\nEach process
    consists of an anterior and a posterior part. \n\nThese two parts are joined,
    outside the foramen, by a bar of bone that exhibits a deep sulcus on its upper
    surface for the passage of the corresponding spinal nerve.\n\nThe anterior portion
    is the homologue of the rib in the thoracic region, and is therefore named the
    costal process or costal element. \n\nIt arises from the side of the body, is
    directed laterally in front of the foramen, and ends in a tubercle, the anterior
    tubercle.\n\nThe posterior part, the true transverse process, springs from the
    vertebral arch behind the foramen and is directed forward and laterally; it ends
    in a flattened vertical tubercle, the posterior tubercle.\n\nThe anterior tubercle
    of the sixth cervical vertebra is known as the carotid tubercle or Chassaignac
    tubercle (for \xC9douard Chassaignac). \n\nThis separates the carotid artery
    from the vertebral artery and the carotid artery can be massaged against this
    tubercle to relieve the symptoms of supraventricular tachycardia. \n\nThe carotid
    tubercle is also used as a landmark for anaesthesia of the brachial plexus and
    cervical plexus.\n\nThe cervical spinal nerves emerge from above the cervical
    vertebrae. \n\nFor example, the cervical spinal nerve 3 (C3) passes above C3.\n\n\n===
    Atlas and axis ===\n\nThe atlas (C1) and axis (C2) are the two topmost vertebrae.\n\nThe
    atlas (C1) is the topmost vertebra, and along with the axis forms the joint connecting
    the skull and spine. \n\nIt lacks a vertebral body, spinous process, and discs
    either superior or inferior to it. \n\nIt is ring-like and consists of an anterior
    arch, posterior arch, and two lateral masses.\nThe axis (C2) forms the pivot
    on which the atlas rotates. \n\nThe most distinctive characteristic of this bone
    is the strong odontoid process (dens) that rises perpendicularly from the upper
    surface of the body and articulates with C1. \n\nThe body is deeper in front
    than behind, and prolonged downward anteriorly so as to overlap the upper and
    front part of the third vertebra.\n\n\n=== Vertebra prominens ===\n\nThe vertebra
    prominens, or C7, has a distinctive long and prominent spinous process, which
    is palpable from the skin surface. \n\nSometimes, the seventh cervical vertebra
    is associated with an abnormal extra rib, known as a cervical rib, which develops
    from the anterior root of the transverse process. \n\nThese ribs are usually
    small, but may occasionally compress blood vessels (such as the subclavian artery
    or subclavian vein) or nerves in the brachial plexus, causing pain, numbness,
    tingling, and weakness in the upper limb, a condition known as thoracic outlet
    syndrome. \n\nVery rarely, this rib occurs in a pair.\nThe long spinous process
    of C7 is thick and nearly horizontal in direction. \n\nIt is not bifurcated,
    and ends in a tubercle that the ligamentum nuchae attaches to. \n\nThis process
    is not always the most prominent of the spinous processes, being found only about
    70% of the time, C6 or T1 can sometimes be the most prominent.\n\nThe transverse
    processes are of considerable size; their posterior roots are large and prominent,
    while the anterior are small and faintly marked. \n\nThe upper surface of each
    usually has a shallow sulcus for the eighth spinal nerve, and its extremity seldom
    presents more than a trace of bifurcation.\n\nThe transverse foramen may be as
    large as that in the other cervical vertebrae, but it is generally smaller on
    one or both sides; occasionally, it is double, and sometimes it is absent.\n\nOn
    the left side, it occasionally gives passage to the vertebral artery; more frequently,
    the vertebral vein traverses it on both sides, but the usual arrangement is for
    both artery and vein to pass in front of the transverse process, not through
    the foramen.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\nThe movement of nodding the head takes place
    predominantly through flexion and extension at the atlanto-occipital joint between
    the atlas and the occipital bone. \n\nHowever, the cervical spine is comparatively
    mobile, and some component of this movement is due to flexion and extension of
    the vertebral column itself. \n\nThis movement between the atlas and occipital
    bone is often referred to as the \"yes joint\", owing to its nature of being
    able to move the head in an up-and-down fashion.\n\nThe movement of shaking or
    rotating the head left and right happens almost entirely at the joint between
    the atlas and the axis, the atlanto-axial joint. \n\nA small amount of rotation
    of the vertebral column itself contributes to the movement. \n\nThis movement
    between the atlas and axis is often referred to as the \"no joint\", owing to
    its nature of being able to rotate the head in a side-to-side fashion.\n\n\n==
    Clinical significance ==\n\nCervical degenerative changes arise from conditions
    such as spondylosis, stenosis of intervertebral discs, and the formation of osteophytes.
    \n\nThe changes are seen on radiographs, which are used in a grading system from
    0\u20134 ranging from no changes (0) to early with minimal development of osteophytes
    (1) to mild with definite osteophytes (2) to moderate with additional disc space
    stenosis or narrowing (3) to the stage of many large osteophytes, severe narrowing
    of the disc space, and more severe vertebral end plate sclerosis (4).Injuries
    to the cervical spine are common at the level of the second cervical vertebrae,
    but neurological injury is uncommon. \n\nC4 and C5 are the areas that see the
    highest amount of cervical spine trauma.If it does occur, however, it may cause
    death or profound disability, including paralysis of the arms, legs, and diaphragm,
    which leads to respiratory failure.\n\nCommon patterns of injury include the
    odontoid fracture and the hangman's fracture, both of which are often treated
    with immobilization in a cervical collar or Halo brace.\n\nA common practice
    is to immobilize a patient's cervical spine to prevent further damage during
    transport to hospital. \n\nThis practice has come under review recently as incidence
    rates of unstable spinal trauma can be as low as 2% in immobilized patients.
    \n\nIn clearing the cervical spine, Canadian studies have developed the Canadian
    C-Spine Rule (CCR) for physicians to decide who should receive radiological imaging.\n\n\n===
    Landmarks ===\n\nThe vertebral column is often used as a marker of human anatomy.
    \n\nThis includes:\n\nAt C1, base of the nose and the hard palate\nAt C2, the
    teeth of a closed mouth\nAt C3, the mandible and hyoid bone\nAt C4, the common
    carotid artery bifurcates.\nFrom C4\u20135, the thyroid cartilage\nFrom C6\u20137,
    the cricoid cartilage\nAt C6, the oesophagus becomes continuous with the laryngopharynx
    and also where the larynx becomes continuous with the trachea. \n\nIt is also
    the level where the carotid pulse can be palpated against the transverse process
    of the C6 vertebrae.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_vertebrae"

  descriptionText: "\n\nCOSTAL CARTILAGE(S)\n\n\nThe costal cartilages are bars of
    hyaline cartilage that serve to prolong the ribs forward and contribute to the
    elasticity of the walls of the thorax. \n\nCostal cartilage is only found at
    the anterior ends of the ribs, providing medial extension.\n\n\n== Differences
    from Ribs 1-12 ==\n\nThe first seven pairs are connected with the sternum; the
    next three are each articulated with the lower border of the cartilage of the
    preceding rib; the last two have pointed extremities, which end in the wall of
    the abdomen.Like the ribs, the costal cartilages vary in their length, breadth,
    and direction. \n\nThey increase in length from the first to the seventh, then
    gradually decrease to the twelfth.\n\nTheir breadth, as well as that of the intervals
    between them, diminishes from the first to the last. \n\nThey are broad at their
    attachments to the ribs, and taper toward their sternal extremities, excepting
    the first two, which are of the same breadth throughout, and the sixth, seventh,
    and eighth, which are enlarged where their margins are in contact.\n\nThey also
    vary in direction: the first descends a little to the sternum, the second is
    horizontal, the third ascends slightly, while the others are angular, following
    the course of the ribs for a short distance, and then ascending to the sternum
    or preceding cartilage.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nEach costal cartilage presents
    two surfaces, two borders, and two extremities.\n\n\n=== Surfaces ===\n\nThe
    anterior surface is convex, and looks forward and upward: that of the first gives
    attachment to the costoclavicular ligament and the subclavius muscle; those of
    the first six or seven at their sternal ends, to the pectoralis major. \n\nThe
    others are covered by, and give partial attachment to, some of the flat muscles
    of the abdomen.\n\nThe posterior surface is concave, and directed backward and
    downward; that of the first gives attachment to the sternothyroideus, those of
    the third to the sixth inclusive to the transversus thoracis muscle, and the
    six or seven inferior ones to the transversus abdominis muscle and the diaphragm.\n\n\n===
    Borders ===\n\nOf the two borders the superior is concave, the inferior convex;
    they afford attachment to the intercostales interni: the upper border of the
    sixth gives attachment also to the pectoralis major.\n\nThe inferior borders
    of the sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth cartilages present heel-like projections
    at the points of greatest convexity. \n\nThese projections carry smooth oblong
    facets which articulate with facets on slight projections from the upper borders
    of the seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth cartilages, respectively.\n\n\n=== Interchondral
    articulations ===\n\nThe interchondral articulations are the joints formed between
    the costal cartilages of the ribs. \n\nThe contiguous borders of the sixth, seventh,
    and eighth, and sometimes those of the ninth and tenth, costal cartilages articulate
    with each other by small, smooth, oblong facets. \n\nEach articulation is enclosed
    in a thin articular capsule, lined by synovial membrane and strengthened laterally
    and medially by ligamentous fibers (interchondral ligaments) which pass from
    one cartilage to the other. \n\nSometimes the fifth costal cartilages, more rarely
    the ninth and tenth, articulate by their lower borders with the adjoining cartilages
    by small oval facets; more frequently the connection is by a few ligamentous
    fibers.\n\n\n=== Extremities ===\n\nThe lateral end of each cartilage is continuous
    with the osseous tissue of the rib to which it belongs.\n\nThe medial end of
    the first is continuous with the sternum; the medial ends of the six succeeding
    ones are rounded and are received into shallow concavities on the lateral margins
    of the sternum.\n\nThe medial ends of the eighth, ninth, and tenth costal cartilages
    are pointed, and are connected each with the cartilage immediately above.\n\nThose
    of the eleventh and twelfth are pointed and free.\n\n\n== Clinical significance
    ==\n\nIn old age, the costal cartilages are prone to superficial ossification.In
    costochondritis and Tietze syndrome, inflammation of the costal cartilage occurs.
    \n\nThis is a common cause of chest pain.Severe trauma may lead to fracture of
    the costal cartilage. \n\nSuch injuries often go unnoticed during x-ray scans,
    but can be diagnosed with CT scans. \n\nSurgery is typically used to fix the
    costal cartilage back onto either the rib or sternum.Costal cartilage may be
    harvested for reparative use elsewhere in the body. \n\nWhilst this is typically
    conducted using a general anaesthetic, IV sedation can also be used. \n\nThe
    procedure presents a minor risk of pleural tear.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costal_cartilage"

  descriptionText: "\n\nCOSTAL CARTILAGE(S)\n\n\nThe costal cartilages are bars of
    hyaline cartilage that serve to prolong the ribs forward and contribute to the
    elasticity of the walls of the thorax. \n\nCostal cartilage is only found at
    the anterior ends of the ribs, providing medial extension.\n\n\n== Differences
    from Ribs 1-12 ==\n\nThe first seven pairs are connected with the sternum; the
    next three are each articulated with the lower border of the cartilage of the
    preceding rib; the last two have pointed extremities, which end in the wall of
    the abdomen.Like the ribs, the costal cartilages vary in their length, breadth,
    and direction. \n\nThey increase in length from the first to the seventh, then
    gradually decrease to the twelfth.\n\nTheir breadth, as well as that of the intervals
    between them, diminishes from the first to the last. \n\nThey are broad at their
    attachments to the ribs, and taper toward their sternal extremities, excepting
    the first two, which are of the same breadth throughout, and the sixth, seventh,
    and eighth, which are enlarged where their margins are in contact.\n\nThey also
    vary in direction: the first descends a little to the sternum, the second is
    horizontal, the third ascends slightly, while the others are angular, following
    the course of the ribs for a short distance, and then ascending to the sternum
    or preceding cartilage.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nEach costal cartilage presents
    two surfaces, two borders, and two extremities.\n\n\n=== Surfaces ===\n\nThe
    anterior surface is convex, and looks forward and upward: that of the first gives
    attachment to the costoclavicular ligament and the subclavius muscle; those of
    the first six or seven at their sternal ends, to the pectoralis major. \n\nThe
    others are covered by, and give partial attachment to, some of the flat muscles
    of the abdomen.\n\nThe posterior surface is concave, and directed backward and
    downward; that of the first gives attachment to the sternothyroideus, those of
    the third to the sixth inclusive to the transversus thoracis muscle, and the
    six or seven inferior ones to the transversus abdominis muscle and the diaphragm.\n\n\n===
    Borders ===\n\nOf the two borders the superior is concave, the inferior convex;
    they afford attachment to the intercostales interni: the upper border of the
    sixth gives attachment also to the pectoralis major.\n\nThe inferior borders
    of the sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth cartilages present heel-like projections
    at the points of greatest convexity. \n\nThese projections carry smooth oblong
    facets which articulate with facets on slight projections from the upper borders
    of the seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth cartilages, respectively.\n\n\n=== Interchondral
    articulations ===\n\nThe interchondral articulations are the joints formed between
    the costal cartilages of the ribs. \n\nThe contiguous borders of the sixth, seventh,
    and eighth, and sometimes those of the ninth and tenth, costal cartilages articulate
    with each other by small, smooth, oblong facets. \n\nEach articulation is enclosed
    in a thin articular capsule, lined by synovial membrane and strengthened laterally
    and medially by ligamentous fibers (interchondral ligaments) which pass from
    one cartilage to the other. \n\nSometimes the fifth costal cartilages, more rarely
    the ninth and tenth, articulate by their lower borders with the adjoining cartilages
    by small oval facets; more frequently the connection is by a few ligamentous
    fibers.\n\n\n=== Extremities ===\n\nThe lateral end of each cartilage is continuous
    with the osseous tissue of the rib to which it belongs.\n\nThe medial end of
    the first is continuous with the sternum; the medial ends of the six succeeding
    ones are rounded and are received into shallow concavities on the lateral margins
    of the sternum.\n\nThe medial ends of the eighth, ninth, and tenth costal cartilages
    are pointed, and are connected each with the cartilage immediately above.\n\nThose
    of the eleventh and twelfth are pointed and free.\n\n\n== Clinical significance
    ==\n\nIn old age, the costal cartilages are prone to superficial ossification.In
    costochondritis and Tietze syndrome, inflammation of the costal cartilage occurs.
    \n\nThis is a common cause of chest pain.Severe trauma may lead to fracture of
    the costal cartilage. \n\nSuch injuries often go unnoticed during x-ray scans,
    but can be diagnosed with CT scans. \n\nSurgery is typically used to fix the
    costal cartilage back onto either the rib or sternum.Costal cartilage may be
    harvested for reparative use elsewhere in the body. \n\nWhilst this is typically
    conducted using a general anaesthetic, IV sedation can also be used. \n\nThe
    procedure presents a minor risk of pleural tear.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costal_cartilage"

  descriptionText: "\n\nPALATINE BONE\n\n\nIn anatomy, the palatine bones () are
    two irregular bones of the facial skeleton in many animal species, located above
    the uvula in the throat. \n\nTogether with the maxillae, they comprise the hard
    palate. (Palate is derived from the Latin palatum.)\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe
    palatine bones are situated at the back of the nasal cavity between the maxilla
    and the pterygoid process of the sphenoid bone.\nThey contribute to the walls
    of three cavities: the floor and lateral walls of the nasal cavity, the roof
    of the mouth, and the floor of the orbits. \n\nThey help to form the pterygopalatine
    and pterygoid fossae, and the inferior orbital fissures.\nEach palatine bone
    somewhat resembles the letter L, and consists of a horizontal plate, a perpendicular
    plate, and three projecting processes \u2014 the pyramidal process, which is
    directed backward and lateral from the junction of the two parts, and the orbital
    and sphenoidal processes, which surmount the vertical part, and are separated
    by a deep notch, the sphenopalatine notch. \n\nThe two plates form the posterior
    part of the hard palate and the floor of the nasal cavity; anteriorly, they join
    with the maxillae. \n\nThe two horizontal plates articulate with each other at
    the posterior part of the median palatine suture and more anteriorly with the
    maxillae at the transverse palatine suture.The human palatine articulates with
    six bones: the sphenoid, ethmoid, maxilla, inferior nasal concha, vomer and opposite
    palatine.\nThere are two important foramina in the palatine bones that transmit
    nerves and blood vessels to this region: the greater and lesser palatine. \n\nThe
    larger greater palatine foramen is located in the posterolateral region of each
    of the palatine bones, usually at the apex of the maxillary third molar. \n\nThe
    greater palatine foramen transmits the greater palatine nerve and blood vessels.
    \n\nA smaller opening nearby, the lesser palatine foramen, transmits the lesser
    palatine nerve and blood vessels to the soft palate and tonsils. \n\nBoth foramina
    are openings of the pterygopalatine canal that carries the descending palatine
    nerves and blood vessels from the pterygopalatine fossa to the palate.\n\n\n==
    Function ==\n\nThe sphenopalatine foramen is the opening between the sphenoid
    bone and orbital processes of the palatine bone; it opens into the nasal cavity
    and gives passage to branches from the pterygopalatine ganglion and the sphenopalatine
    artery from the maxillary artery.\n\n\n== Other animals ==\n\nIn bony fish the
    palatine bone consists of the perpendicular plate only, lying on the inner edge
    of the maxilla. \n\nThe lower surface of the bone may bear several teeth, forming
    a second row behind those of the maxilla; in many cases, these are actually larger
    than the maxillary teeth. \n\nAlthough a similar pattern was present in primitive
    tetrapods, the palatine bone is reduced in most living amphibians, forming, in
    frogs and salamanders, only a narrow bar between the vomer and maxilla.Early
    fossil reptiles retained the arrangement seen in more primitive vertebrates,
    but in mammals, the lower surface of the palatine became folded over during evolution,
    forming the horizontal plate, and meeting in the midline of the mouth. \n\nThis
    forms the rear of the hard palate, separating the oral and nasal cavities, and
    making it easier to breathe while eating. \n\nA parallel development has occurred
    to varying degrees in many living reptiles, reaching its greatest extent in crocodilians.
    \n\nIn birds, the palatine bones remain separate, long the sides of the rear
    part of the upper jaw, and typically have a mobile articulation with the cranium.There
    are numerous variations amongst mammals, amphibians and other species. \n\nFor
    example, the palatine bone in many amphibians such as the rough-skinned newt
    manifests as a distinct V-shaped structure. \n\nIn the case of cat species, the
    horizontal and a vertical elements join at a forty five degree angle.\n\n\n==

  descriptionText: "\n\nMOLAR (TOOTH)\n\n\nThe molars or molar teeth are large, flat
    teeth at the back of the mouth. \n\nThey are more developed in mammals. \n\nThey
    are used primarily to grind food during chewing. \n\nThe name molar derives from
    Latin, molaris dens, meaning \"millstone tooth\", from mola, millstone and dens,
    tooth. \n\nMolars show a great deal of diversity in size and shape across mammal
    groups. \n\nThe third molar of humans is sometimes vestigial.\n\n\n== Human anatomy
    ==\n\n\nIn humans, the molar teeth have either four or five cusps. \n\nAdult
    humans have 12 molars, in four groups of three at the back of the mouth. \n\nThe
    third, rearmost molar in each group is called a wisdom tooth. \n\nIt is the last
    tooth to appear, breaking through the front of the gum at about the age of 20,
    although this varies from individual to individual. \n\nRace can also affect
    the age at which this occurs, with statistical variations between groups. \n\nIn
    some cases, it may not even erupt at all.\nThe human mouth contains upper (maxillary)
    and lower (mandibular) molars. \n\nThey are: maxillary first molar, maxillary
    second molar, maxillary third molar, mandibular first molar, mandibular second
    molar, and mandibular third molar.\n\n\n== Mammal evolution ==\n\n\nIn mammals,
    the crown of the molars and premolars is folded into a wide range of complex
    shapes. \n\nThe basic elements of the crown are the more or less conical projections
    called cusps and the valleys that separate them. \n\nThe cusps contain both dentine
    and enamel, whereas minor projections on the crown, called crenulations, are
    the result of different enamel thickness. \n\nCusps are occasionally joined to
    form ridges and expanded to form crests. \n\nCingula are often incomplete ridges
    that pass around the base of the crown.Mammalian, multicusped cheek teeth probably
    evolved from single-cusped teeth in synapsids, although the diversity of therapsid
    molar patterns and the complexity in the molars of the earliest mammals make
    determining how this happened impossible. \n\nAccording to the widely accepted
    \"differentiation theory\", additional cusps have arisen by budding or outgrowth
    from the crown, while the rivalling \"concrescence theory\" instead proposes
    that complex teeth evolved by the clustering of originally separate conical teeth.
    \n\nTherian mammals (placentals and marsupials) are generally agreed to have
    evolved from an ancestor with tribosphenic cheek teeth, with three main cusps
    arranged in a triangle.\n\n\n== Morphology ==\n\n\nEach major cusp on an upper
    molar is called a cone and is identified by a prefix dependent on its relative
    location on the tooth: proto-, para-, meta-, hypo-, and ento-. \n\nSuffixes are
    added to these names: -id is added to cusps on a lower molar (e.g., protoconid);
    -ule to a minor cusp (e.g., protoconulid). \n\nA shelf-like ridge on the lower
    part of the crown (on an upper molar) is called a cingulum; the same feature
    on the lower molar a cingulid, and a minor cusp on these, for example, a cingular
    cuspule or conulid.\n\n\n=== Tribosphenic ===\n\n\nThe design that is considered
    one of the most important characteristics of mammals is a three-cusped shape
    called a tribosphenic molar. \n\nThis molar design has two important features:
    the trigonid, or shearing end, and the talonid, or crushing heel. \n\nIn modern
    tribosphenic molars, the trigonid is towards the front of the jaw and the talonid
    is towards the rear.\n\nThe tribosphenic tooth is found in insectivores and young
    platypuses (adults have no teeth). \n\nUpper molars look like three-pointed mountain
    ranges; lowers look like two peaks and a third off to the side.\nThe tribosphenic
    design appears primitively in all groups of mammals. \n\nSome paleontologists
    believe that it developed independently in monotremes (or australosphenidans),
    rather than being inherited from an ancestor that they share with marsupials
    and placentals (or boreosphenidans); but this idea has critics and the debate
    is still going on. \n\nFor example, the dentition of the Early Cretaceous monotreme
    Steropodon is similar to those of Peramus and dryolestoids, which suggests that
    monotremes are related to some pre-tribosphenic therian mammals, but, on the
    other hand, the status of neither of these two groups is well-established.\n\nSome
    Jurassic mammals, such as Shuotherium and Pseudotribos, have \"reversed tribosphenic\"
    molars, in which the talonid is towards the front. \n\nThis variant is regarded
    as an example of convergent evolution.From the primitive tribosphenic tooth,
    molars have diversified into several unique morphologies. \n\nIn many groups,
    a fourth cusp, the hypocone (hypoconid), subsequently evolved (see below).\n\n\n===
    Quadrate ===\n\n\nQuadrate (also called quadritubercular or euthemorphic) molars
    have an additional fourth cusp on the lingual (tongue) side called the hypocone,
    located posterior to the protocone. \n\nQuadrate molars appeared early in mammal
    evolution and are present in many species, including hedgehogs, raccoons, and
    many primates, including humans.\n\nThere may be a fifth cusp.\n\nIn many mammals,
    additional smaller cusps called conules appear between the larger cusps. \n\nThey
    are named after their locations, e.g. a paraconule is located between a paracone
    and a metacone, a hypoconulid is located between a hypoconid and an entoconid.\n\n\n===
    Bunodont ===\n\n\nIn bunodont molars, the cusps are low and rounded hills rather
    than sharp peaks. \n\nThey are most common among omnivores such as pigs, bears,
    and humans. \n\nBunodont molars are effective crushing devices and often basically
    quadrate in shape.\n\n\n=== Hypsodont ===\n\nHypsodont dentition is characterized
    by high-crowned teeth and enamel that extends far past the gum line, which provides
    extra material for wear and tear. \n\nSome examples of animals with hypsodont
    dentition are cattle and horses, all animals that feed on gritty, fibrous material.
    \n\nHypsodont molars can continue to grow throughout life, for example in some
    species of Arvicolinae (herbivorous rodents).Hypsodont molars lack both a crown
    and a neck. \n\nThe occlusal surface is rough and mostly flat, adapted for crushing
    and grinding plant material. \n\nThe body is covered with cementum both above
    and below the gingival line, below which is a layer of enamel covering the entire
    length of the body. \n\nThe cementum and the enamel invaginate into the thick
    layer of dentin.\n\n\n=== Brachydont ===\n\nThe opposite condition to hypsodont
    is called brachydont or brachyodont (from brachys 'short'). \n\nIt is a type
    of dentition characterized by low-crowned teeth. \n\nHuman teeth are brachydont.A
    brachydont tooth has a crown above the gingival line and a neck just below it,
    and at least one root. \n\nA cap of enamel covers the crown and extends down
    to the neck. \n\nCementum is only found below the gingival line. \n\nThe occlusal
    surfaces tend to be pointed, well-suited for holding prey and tearing and shredding.\n\n\n===
    Zalambdodont ===\n\nZalambdodont molars have three cusps, one larger on the lingual
    side and two smaller on the labial side, joined by two crests that form a V-
    or \u03BB-shape. \n\nThe larger inner cusp might be homologous with the paracone
    in a tribosphenic molar, but can also be fused with the metacone. \n\nThe protocone
    is typically missing. \n\nThe two smaller labial cusps are located on an expanded
    shelf called the stylar shelf. \n\nZalambdodont molars are found in, for example,
    golden moles and solenodons.\n\n\n=== Dilambdodont ===\n\nLike zalambdodont molars,
    dilambdodont molars have a distinct ectoloph, but are shaped like two lambdas
    or a W. \n\nOn the lingual side, at the bottom of the W, are the metacone and
    paracone, and the stylar shelf is on the labial side. \n\nA protocone is present
    lingual to the ectoloph. \n\nDilambdodont molars are present in shrews, moles,
    and some insectivorous bats.\n\n\n=== Lophodont ===\n\n\nLophodont teeth are
    easily identified by the differentiating patterns of ridges or lophs of enamel
    interconnecting the cusps on the crowns. \n\nPresent in most herbivores, these
    patterns of lophs can be a simple, ring-like edge, as in mole rats, or a complex
    arrangement of series of ridges and cross-ridges, as those in odd-toed ungulates,
    such as equids.Lophodont molars have hard and elongated enamel ridges called
    lophs oriented either along or perpendicular to the dental row. \n\nLophodont
    molars are common in herbivores that grind their food thoroughly. \n\nExamples
    include tapirs, manatees, and many rodents.When two lophs form transverse, often
    ring-shaped, ridges on a tooth, the arrangement is called bilophodont. \n\nThis
    pattern is common in primates, but can also be found in lagomorphs (hares, rabbits,
    and pikas) and some rodents.\n\nExtreme forms of lophodonty in elephants and
    some rodents (such as Otomys) is known as loxodonty. \n\nThe African elephant
    belongs to a genus called Loxodonta because of this feature.\n\n\n=== Selenodont
    ===\n\nIn selenodont molars (so-named after moon goddess Selene), the major cusp
    is elongated into crescent-shaped ridge. \n\nExamples include most even-toed
    ungulates, such as cattle and deer.\n\n\n=== Secodont ===\n\n\nMany carnivorous
    mammals have enlarged and blade-like teeth especially adapted for slicing and
    chopping called carnassials. \n\nA general term for such blade-like teeth is
    secodont or plagiaulacoid.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_(tooth)"

  descriptionText: "\n\nCOSTAL CARTILAGE(S)\n\n\nThe costal cartilages are bars of
    hyaline cartilage that serve to prolong the ribs forward and contribute to the
    elasticity of the walls of the thorax. \n\nCostal cartilage is only found at
    the anterior ends of the ribs, providing medial extension.\n\n\n== Differences
    from Ribs 1-12 ==\n\nThe first seven pairs are connected with the sternum; the
    next three are each articulated with the lower border of the cartilage of the
    preceding rib; the last two have pointed extremities, which end in the wall of
    the abdomen.Like the ribs, the costal cartilages vary in their length, breadth,
    and direction. \n\nThey increase in length from the first to the seventh, then
    gradually decrease to the twelfth.\n\nTheir breadth, as well as that of the intervals
    between them, diminishes from the first to the last. \n\nThey are broad at their
    attachments to the ribs, and taper toward their sternal extremities, excepting
    the first two, which are of the same breadth throughout, and the sixth, seventh,
    and eighth, which are enlarged where their margins are in contact.\n\nThey also
    vary in direction: the first descends a little to the sternum, the second is
    horizontal, the third ascends slightly, while the others are angular, following
    the course of the ribs for a short distance, and then ascending to the sternum
    or preceding cartilage.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nEach costal cartilage presents
    two surfaces, two borders, and two extremities.\n\n\n=== Surfaces ===\n\nThe
    anterior surface is convex, and looks forward and upward: that of the first gives
    attachment to the costoclavicular ligament and the subclavius muscle; those of
    the first six or seven at their sternal ends, to the pectoralis major. \n\nThe
    others are covered by, and give partial attachment to, some of the flat muscles
    of the abdomen.\n\nThe posterior surface is concave, and directed backward and
    downward; that of the first gives attachment to the sternothyroideus, those of
    the third to the sixth inclusive to the transversus thoracis muscle, and the
    six or seven inferior ones to the transversus abdominis muscle and the diaphragm.\n\n\n===
    Borders ===\n\nOf the two borders the superior is concave, the inferior convex;
    they afford attachment to the intercostales interni: the upper border of the
    sixth gives attachment also to the pectoralis major.\n\nThe inferior borders
    of the sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth cartilages present heel-like projections
    at the points of greatest convexity. \n\nThese projections carry smooth oblong
    facets which articulate with facets on slight projections from the upper borders
    of the seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth cartilages, respectively.\n\n\n=== Interchondral
    articulations ===\n\nThe interchondral articulations are the joints formed between
    the costal cartilages of the ribs. \n\nThe contiguous borders of the sixth, seventh,
    and eighth, and sometimes those of the ninth and tenth, costal cartilages articulate
    with each other by small, smooth, oblong facets. \n\nEach articulation is enclosed
    in a thin articular capsule, lined by synovial membrane and strengthened laterally
    and medially by ligamentous fibers (interchondral ligaments) which pass from
    one cartilage to the other. \n\nSometimes the fifth costal cartilages, more rarely
    the ninth and tenth, articulate by their lower borders with the adjoining cartilages
    by small oval facets; more frequently the connection is by a few ligamentous
    fibers.\n\n\n=== Extremities ===\n\nThe lateral end of each cartilage is continuous
    with the osseous tissue of the rib to which it belongs.\n\nThe medial end of
    the first is continuous with the sternum; the medial ends of the six succeeding
    ones are rounded and are received into shallow concavities on the lateral margins
    of the sternum.\n\nThe medial ends of the eighth, ninth, and tenth costal cartilages
    are pointed, and are connected each with the cartilage immediately above.\n\nThose
    of the eleventh and twelfth are pointed and free.\n\n\n== Clinical significance
    ==\n\nIn old age, the costal cartilages are prone to superficial ossification.In
    costochondritis and Tietze syndrome, inflammation of the costal cartilage occurs.
    \n\nThis is a common cause of chest pain.Severe trauma may lead to fracture of
    the costal cartilage. \n\nSuch injuries often go unnoticed during x-ray scans,
    but can be diagnosed with CT scans. \n\nSurgery is typically used to fix the
    costal cartilage back onto either the rib or sternum.Costal cartilage may be
    harvested for reparative use elsewhere in the body. \n\nWhilst this is typically
    conducted using a general anaesthetic, IV sedation can also be used. \n\nThe
    procedure presents a minor risk of pleural tear.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costal_cartilage"

  descriptionText: "\n\nLUMBAR VERTEBRAE\n\n\nThe lumbar vertebrae are, in human
    anatomy, the five vertebrae between the rib cage and the pelvis. \n\nThey are
    the largest segments of the vertebral column and are characterized by the absence
    of the foramen transversarium within the transverse process (since it is only
    found in the cervical region) and by the absence of facets on the sides of the
    body (as found only in the thoracic region). \n\nThey are designated L1 to L5,
    starting at the top. \n\nThe lumbar vertebrae help support the weight of the
    body, and permit movement.\n\n\n== Human anatomy ==\n\n=== General characteristics
    ===\n\nThe figure on the left depicts the general characteristics of the first
    through fourth lumbar vertebrae. \n\nThe fifth vertebra contains certain peculiarities,
    which are detailed below.\n\nAs with other vertebrae, each lumbar vertebra consists
    of a vertebral body and a vertebral arch. \n\nThe vertebral arch, consisting
    of a pair of pedicles and a pair of laminae, encloses the vertebral foramen (opening)
    and supports seven processes.\n\n\n==== Body ====\n\nThe vertebral body of each
    lumbar vertebra is kidney shaped, wider from side to side than from front to
    back, and a little thicker in front than in back. \n\nIt is flattened or slightly
    concave above and below, concave behind, and deeply constricted in front and
    at the sides.\n\n\n==== Arch ====\n\nThe pedicles are very strong, directed backward
    from the upper part of the vertebral body; consequently, the inferior vertebral
    notches are of considerable depth. \n\nThe pedicles change in morphology from
    the upper lumbar to the lower lumbar. \n\nThey increase in sagittal width from
    9 mm to up to 18 mm at L5. \n\nThey increase in angulation in the axial plane
    from 10 degrees to 20 degrees by L5. \n\nThe pedicle is sometimes used as a portal
    of entrance into the vertebral body for fixation with pedicle screws or for placement
    of bone cement as with kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty.\n\nThe laminae are broad,
    short, and strong. \n\nThey form the posterior portion of the vertebral arch.
    \n\nIn the upper lumbar region the lamina are taller than wide but in the lower
    lumbar vertebra the lamina are wider than tall. \n\nThe lamina connects the spinous
    process to the pedicles.\nThe vertebral foramen within the arch is triangular,
    larger than the thoracic vertebrae, but smaller than in the cervical vertebrae.\n\n\n====
    Processes ====\n\nThe spinous process is thick, broad, and somewhat quadrilateral;
    it projects backward and ends in a rough, uneven border, thickest below where
    it is occasionally notched.The superior and inferior articular processes are
    well-defined, projecting respectively upward and downward from the junctions
    of pedicles and laminae. \n\nThe facets on the superior processes are concave,
    and look backward and medialward; those on the inferior are convex, and are directed
    forward and lateralward. \n\nThe former are wider apart than the latter since
    in the articulated column, the inferior articular processes are embraced by the
    superior processes of the subjacent vertebra.The transverse processes are long
    and slender. \n\nThey are horizontal in the upper three lumbar vertebrae and
    incline a little upward in the lower two. \n\nIn the upper three vertebrae they
    arise from the junctions of the pedicles and laminae, but in the lower two they
    are set farther forward and spring from the pedicles and posterior parts of the
    vertebral bodies. \n\nThey are situated in front of the articular processes instead
    of behind them as in the thoracic vertebrae, and are homologous with the ribs.\n\nThree
    portions or tubercles can be noticed in a transverse process of a lower lumbar
    vertebrae: the lateral or costiform process, the mammillary process, and the
    accessory process. \n\nThe costiform is lateral, the mammillary is superior (cranial),
    and the accessory is inferior (caudal). \n\nThe mammillary is connected in the
    lumbar region with the back part of the superior articular process. \n\nThe accessory
    process is situated at the back part of the base of the transverse process. \n\nThe
    tallest and thickest costiform process is usually that of L5.\n\n\n=== First
    and fifth lumbar vertebrae ===\n\n\nThe first lumbar vertebra is level with the
    anterior end of the ninth rib. \n\nThis level is also called the important transpyloric
    plane, since the pylorus of the stomach is at this level. \n\nOther important
    structures are also located at this level, they include; fundus of the gall bladder,
    celiac trunk, superior mesenteric artery, termination of spinal cord, beginning
    of filum terminalis, renal vessels, middle suprarenal arteries, and hila of kidneys.\n\nThe
    fifth lumbar vertebra is characterized by its body being much deeper in front
    than behind, which accords with the prominence of the sacrovertebral articulation;
    by the smaller size of its spinous process; by the wide interval between the
    inferior articular processes, and by the thickness of its transverse processes,
    which spring from the body as well as from the pedicles.\n\nThe fifth lumbar
    vertebra is by far the most common site of spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis.Most
    individuals have five lumbar vertebrae, while some have four or six. \n\nLumbar
    disorders that normally affect L5 will affect L4 or L6 in these latter individuals.\n\n\n===
    Segmental movements ===\n\nThe range of segmental movements in a single segment
    is difficult to measure clinically, not only because of variations between individuals,
    but also because it is age and sex dependent. \n\nFurthermore, flexion and extension
    in the lumbal spine is the product of a combination of rotation and translation
    in the sagittal plane between each vertebra.Ranges of segmental movements in
    the lumbar spine (White and Punjabi, 1990) are (in degrees):\n\n\n=== Congenital
    anomalies ===\n\nCongenital vertebral anomalies can cause compression of the
    spinal cord by deforming the vertebral canal or causing instability.\n\n\n==
    Other animals ==\n\nAfrican apes have three and four lumbar vertebrae, (bonobos
    have longer spines with an additional vertebra) and humans normally five. \n\nThis
    difference, and because the lumbar spines of the extinct Nacholapithecus (a Miocene
    hominoid with six lumbar vertebrae and no tail) are similar to those of early
    Australopithecus and early Homo, it is assumed that the Chimpanzee-human last
    common ancestor also had a long vertebral column with a long lumbar region and
    that the reduction in the number of lumbar vertebrae evolved independently in
    each ape clade.\n\nThe limited number of lumbar vertebrae in chimpanzees and
    gorillas result in an inability to lordose (curve) their lumbar spines, in contrast
    to the spines of Old World monkeys and Nacholapithecus and Proconsul, which suggests
    that the last common ancestor was not \"short-backed\" as previously believed.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumbar_vertebrae"

  descriptionText: "\n\nTRAPEZIUM BONE\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe trapezium is distinguished
    by a deep groove on its anterior surface. \n\nIt is situated at the radial side
    of the carpus, between the scaphoid and the first metacarpal bone (the metacarpal
    bone of the thumb). \n\nIt is homologous with the first distal carpal of reptiles
    and amphibians.\n\n\n=== Surfaces ===\n\nThe trapezium is an irregular-shaped
    carpal bone found within the hand. \n\nThe trapezium is found within the distal
    row of carpal bones, and is directly adjacent to the metacarpal bone of the thumb.
    \n\nOn its ulnar surface are found the trapezoid and scaphoid bones.\n\nThe superior
    surface is directed upward and medialward; medially it is smooth, and articulates
    with the scaphoid; laterally it is rough and continuous with the lateral surface.\n\nThe
    inferior surface is oval, concave from side to side, convex from before backward,
    so as to form a saddle-shaped surface for articulation with the base of the first
    metacarpal bone. \n\nThis saddle-shaped articulation is partially responsible
    for the thumb's opposable motion.\n\nThe dorsal surface is smooth.\nThe palmar
    surface is narrow and rough. \n\nAt its upper part is a deep groove, running
    from above obliquely downward and medialward; it transmits the tendon of the
    Flexor carpi radialis, and is bounded laterally by an oblique ridge. \n\nThis
    surface gives origin to the Opponens pollicis and to the Abductor and Flexor
    pollicis brevis; it also affords attachment to the transverse carpal ligament.\n\nThe
    lateral surface is broad and rough, for the attachment of ligaments.\n\nThe medial
    surface presents two facets; the upper, large and concave, articulates with the
    trapezoid bone; the lower, small and oval, with the base of the second metacarpal.\n\n\n===
    Tubercle of trapezium ===\n\nThe tubercle of trapezium is a tubercle found on
    the anterior surface of the bone. \n\nIt is where sometimes abductor pollicis
    brevis muscle attaches.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\nThe carpal bones function as a
    unit to provide a bony superstructure for the hand. \n\nThe trapezium is the
    most radial of the bones surrounding the carpal tunnel.\n\nIt is important in
    thumb movement.\n\n\n== Clinical relevance ==\n\nThe trapezium is susceptible
    to arthritis at the joint with the metacarpal bone of the thumb, due to overuse.\n\n\n==
    History ==\n\nThe etymology derives from the Greek trapezion which means \"a
    little table\", from trapeza meaning \"table\", itself from (te)tra- \"four\"
    and pod- \"foot\". \n\nThe bone was first documented in 1840.\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapezium_(bone)"

  descriptionText: "\n\nINCISOR\n\n\nIncisors (from Latin incidere, \"to cut\") are
    the front teeth present in most mammals. \n\nThey are located in the premaxilla
    above and on the mandible below. \n\nHumans have a total of eight (two on each
    side, top and bottom). \n\nOpossums have 18, whereas armadillos have none.\n\n\n==
    Structure ==\n\nAdult humans normally have eight incisors, two of each type.
    \n\nThe types of incisor are:\n\nmaxillary central incisor (upper jaw, closest
    to the center of the lips)\nmaxillary lateral incisor (upper jaw, beside the
    maxillary central incisor)\nmandibular central incisor (lower jaw, closest to
    the center of the lips)\nmandibular lateral incisor (lower jaw, beside the mandibular
    central incisor)Children with a full set of deciduous teeth (primary teeth) also
    have eight incisors, named the same way as in permanent teeth. \n\nYoung children
    may have from zero to eight incisors depending on the stage of their tooth eruption
    and tooth development. \n\nTypically, the mandibular central incisors erupt first,
    followed by the maxillary central incisors, the mandibular lateral incisors and
    finally the maxillary laterals. \n\nThe rest of the primary dentition erupts
    after the incisors.Apart from the first molars, the incisors are also the first
    permanent teeth to erupt, following the same order as the primary teeth, among
    themselves.\n\n\n=== Other animals ===\n\nAmong other animals, the number varies
    from species to species. \n\nOpossums have 18, whereas armadillos have none.
    \n\nCats, dogs, foxes, pigs, and horses have twelve. \n\nRodents have four. \n\nRabbits
    and hares (lagomorphs) were once considered rodents, but are distinguished by
    having six\u2014one small pair, called \"peg teeth\", is located directly behind
    the most anterior pair. \n\nIncisors are used to bite off tough foods, such as
    red meat.\nCattle (cows, bulls, etc.) have none on top but a total of six on
    the bottom.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\nIn cats, the incisors are small; biting off
    meat is done with the canines and the carnassials. \n\nIn elephants, the upper
    incisors are modified into curved tusks (unlike with Narwhals, where it is a
    canine that develops into a straight and twisted tusk). \n\nThe incisors of rodents
    grow throughout life and are worn by gnawing. \n\nIn humans, the incisors serve
    to cut off pieces of food, as well as in the grip of other food items.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incisor"

  descriptionText: "\n\nHUMERUS\n\n\nThe humerus (plural: humeri) is a long bone
    in the arm that runs from the shoulder to the elbow. \n\nIt connects the scapula
    and the two bones of the lower arm, the radius and ulna, and consists of three
    sections. \n\nThe humeral upper extremity consists of a rounded head, a narrow
    neck, and two short processes (tubercles, sometimes called tuberosities). \n\nThe
    body is cylindrical in its upper portion, and more prismatic below. The lower
    extremity consists of 2 epicondyles, 2 processes (trochlea & capitulum), and
    3 fossae (radial fossa, coronoid fossa, and olecranon fossa). \n\nAs well as
    its true anatomical neck, the constriction below the greater and lesser tubercles
    of the humerus is referred to as its surgical neck due to its tendency to fracture,
    thus often becoming the focus of surgeons.\n\n\n=== Upper extremity ===\n\nThe
    upper or proximal extremity of the humerus consists of the bone's large rounded
    head joined to the body by a constricted portion called the neck, and two eminences,
    the greater and lesser tubercles.\n\n\n==== Head ====\n\nThe head (caput humeri),
    is nearly hemispherical in form. It is directed upward, medialward, and a little
    backward, and articulates with the glenoid cavity of the scapula to form the
    glenohumeral joint (shoulder joint). \n\nThe circumference of its articular surface
    is slightly constricted and is termed the anatomical neck, in contradistinction
    to a constriction below the tubercles called the surgical neck which is frequently
    the seat of fracture. \n\nFracture of the anatomical neck rarely occurs.\n\nThe
    diameter of the humeral head is generally larger in men than in women.\n\n\n====
    Anatomical neck ====\n\nThe anatomical neck (collum anatomicum) is obliquely
    directed, forming an obtuse angle with the body. \n\nIt is best marked in the
    lower half of its circumference; in the upper half it is represented by a narrow
    groove separating the head from the tubercles. \n\nThe line separating the head
    from the rest of the upper end is called the anatomical neck. \n\nIt affords
    attachment to the articular capsule of the shoulder-joint, and is perforated
    by numerous vascular foramina. Fracture of the anatomical neck rarely occurs.\n\nThe
    anatomical neck of the humerus is an indentation distal to the head of the humerus
    on which the articular capsule attaches.\n\n\n==== Surgical neck ====\n\nThe
    surgical neck is a narrow area distal to the tubercles that is a common site
    of fracture.\n\nIt makes contact with the axillary nerve and the posterior humeral
    circumflex artery.\n\n\n==== Greater tubercle ====\n\nThe greater tubercle (tuberculum
    majus; greater tuberosity) is a large, posteriorly placed projection that is
    placed laterally. \n\nThe greater tubercle is where supraspinatus, infraspinatus
    and teres minor muscles are attached. \n\nThe crest of the greater tubercle forms
    the lateral lip of the bicipital groove and is the site for insertion of pectoralis
    major.\n\nThe greater tubercle is just lateral to the anatomical neck.\n\nIts
    upper surface is rounded and marked by three flat impressions: the highest of
    these gives insertion to the supraspinatus muscle; the middle to the infraspinatus
    muscle; the lowest one, and the body of the bone for about 2.5 cm. below it,
    to the teres minor muscle. \n\nThe lateral surface of the greater tubercle is
    convex, rough, and continuous with the lateral surface of the body.\n\n\n====
    Lesser tubercle ====\n\nThe lesser tubercle (tuberculum minus; lesser tuberosity)
    is smaller, anterolaterally placed to the head of the humerus. \n\nThe lesser
    tubercle provides insertion to subscapularis muscle. \n\nBoth these tubercles
    are found in the proximal part of the shaft. \n\nThe crest of the lesser tubercle
    forms the medial lip of the bicipital groove and is the site for insertion of
    teres major and latissimus dorsi muscles.\n\nThe lesser tuberosity, is more prominent
    than the greater: it is situated in front, and is directed medialward and forward.
    \n\nAbove and in front it presents an impression for the insertion of the tendon
    of the subscapularis muscle.\n\n\n==== Bicipital groove ====\n\nThe tubercles
    are separated from each other by a deep groove, the bicipital groove (intertubercular
    groove; bicipital sulcus), which lodges the long tendon of the biceps brachii
    muscle and transmits a branch of the anterior humeral circumflex artery to the
    shoulder-joint. \n\nIt runs obliquely downward, and ends near the junction of
    the upper with the middle third of the bone. \n\nIn the fresh state its upper
    part is covered with a thin layer of cartilage, lined by a prolongation of the
    synovial membrane of the shoulder-joint; its lower portion gives insertion to
    the tendon of the latissimus dorsi muscle. \n\nIt is deep and narrow above, and
    becomes shallow and a little broader as it descends. \n\nIts lips are called,
    respectively, the crests of the greater and lesser tubercles (bicipital ridges),
    and form the upper parts of the anterior and medial borders of the body of the
    bone.\n\n\n=== Shaft ===\n\nThe body or shaft of the humerus is triangular to
    cylindrical in cut section and is compressed anteroposteriorly. It has 3 surfaces,
    namely:\n\nAnterolateral surface: the area between the lateral border of the
    humerus to the line drawn as a continuation of the crest of the greater tubercle.
    \n\nThe antero-lateral surface is directed lateralward above, where it is smooth,
    rounded, and covered by the deltoid muscle; forward and lateralward below, where
    it is slightly concave from above downward, and gives origin to part of the Brachialis.
    \n\nAbout the middle of this surface is a rough, rectangular elevation, the deltoid
    tuberosity for the insertion of the deltoid muscle; below this is the radial
    sulcus, directed obliquely from behind, forward, and downward, and transmitting
    the radial nerve and profunda artery.\n\n\nAnteromedial surface: the area between
    the medial border of the humerus to the line drawn as a continuation of the crest
    of the greater tubercle. \n\nThe antero-medial surface, less extensive than the
    antero-lateral, is directed medialward above, forward and medialward below; its
    upper part is narrow, and forms the floor of the intertubercular groove which
    gives insertion to the tendon of the latissimus dorsi muscle; its middle part
    is slightly rough for the attachment of some of the fibers of the tendon of insertion
    of the coracobrachialis muscle; its lower part is smooth, concave from above
    downward, and gives origin to the brachialis muscle.\n\nPosterior surface: the
    area between the medial and lateral borders. \n\nThe posterior surface appears
    somewhat twisted, so that its upper part is directed a little medialward, its
    lower part backward and a little lateralward. \n\nNearly the whole of this surface
    is covered by the lateral and medial heads of the Triceps brachii, the former
    arising above, the latter below the radial sulcus.\n\nIts three borders are:\n\nAnterior
    border of humerus: \n    the anterior border runs from the front of the greater
    tubercle above to the coronoid fossa below, separating the antero-medial from
    the antero-lateral surface. \n\nIts upper part is a prominent ridge, the crest
    of the greater tubercle; it serves for the insertion of the tendon of the pectoralis
    major muscle. \n\nAbout its center it forms the anterior boundary of the deltoid
    tuberosity, on which the deltoid muscle attaches; below, it is smooth and rounded,
    affording attachment to the brachialis muscle.\n\nLateral border of humerus:
    \n    the lateral border runs from the back part of the greater tubercle to the
    lateral epicondyle, and separates the anterolateral from the posterior surface.
    \n\nIts upper half is rounded and indistinctly marked, serving for the attachment
    of the lower part of the insertion of the teres minor muscle, and below this
    giving origin to the lateral head of the triceps brachii muscle; its center is
    traversed by a broad but shallow oblique depression, the spiral groove (musculospiral
    groove). \n\nThe radial nerve runs in the spiral groove.  \n\nIts lower part
    forms a prominent, rough margin, a little curved from backward, forward the lateral
    supracondylar ridge, which presents an anterior lip for the origin of the brachioradialis
    muscle above, and extensor carpi radialis longus muscle above, a posterior lip
    for the triceps brachii muscle, and an intermediate ridge for the attachment
    of the lateral intermuscular septum.\n\nMedial border of humerus: \n    the medial
    border extends from the lesser tubercle to the medial epicondyle. \n\nIts upper
    third consists of a prominent ridge, the crest of the lesser tubercle, which
    gives insertion to the tendon of the teres major muscle. \n\nAbout its center
    is a slight impression for the insertion of the coracobrachialis muscle, and
    just below this is the entrance of the nutrient canal, directed downward; sometimes
    there is a second nutrient canal at the commencement of the radial sulcus. \n\nThe
    inferior third of this border is raised into a slight ridge, the medial supracondylar
    ridge, which became very prominent below; it presents an anterior lip for the
    origins of the brachialis muscle and the pronator teres muscle, a posterior lip
    for the medial head of the triceps brachii muscle, and an intermediate ridge
    for the attachment of the medial intermuscular septum.\n\nThe Deltoid tuberosity
    is a roughened surface on the lateral surface of the shaft of the Humerus and
    acts as the site of insertion of deltoideus muscle. \n\nThe posteror superior
    part of the shaft has a crest, beginning just below the surgical neck of the
    humerus and extends till the superior tip of the deltoid tuberosity. This is
    where the lateral head of triceps brachii  is attached.\n\nThe radial sulcus,
    also known as the spiral groove is found on the posterior surface of the shaft
    and is a shallow oblique groove through which the radial nerve passes along with
    deep vessels. \n\nThis is located posteroinferior to the deltoid tuberosity.
    The inferior boundary of the spiral groove is continuous distally with the lateral
    border of the shaft.\n\nThe nutrient foramen of the humerus is located in the
    anteromedial surface of the humerus. The nutrient arteries enter the humerus
    through this foramen.\n\n\n=== Distal humerus ===\n\nThe distal or lower extremity
    of the humerus is flattened from before backward, and curved slightly forward;
    it ends below in a broad, articular surface, which is divided into two parts
    by a slight ridge. \n\nProjecting on either side are the lateral and medial epicondyles.\n\n\n====
    Articular surface ====\n\nThe articular surface extends a little lower than the
    epicondyles, and is curved slightly forward; its medial extremity occupies a
    lower level than the lateral. \n\nThe lateral portion of this surface consists
    of a smooth, rounded eminence, named the capitulum of the humerus; it articulates
    with the cup-shaped depression on the head of the radius, and is limited to the
    front and lower part of the bone.\n\n\n=== Fossae ===\n\nAbove the front part
    of the trochlea is a small depression, the coronoid fossa, which receives the
    coronoid process of the ulna during flexion of the forearm.\n\nAbove the back
    part of the trochlea is a deep triangular depression, the olecranon fossa, in
    which the summit of the olecranon is received in extension of the forearm.\n\nThe
    coronoid fossa is the medial hollow part on the anterior surface of the distal
    humerus. \n\nThe coronoid fossa is smaller than the olecranon fossa and receives
    the coronoid process of the ulna during maximum flexion of the elbow.\n\nAbove
    the front part of the capitulum is a slight depression, the radial fossa, which
    receives the anterior border of the head of the radius, when the forearm is flexed.\n\nThese
    foss\xE6 are separated from one another by a thin, transparent lamina of bone,
    which is sometimes perforated by a supratrochlear foramen; they are lined in
    the fresh state by the synovial membrane of the elbow-joint, and their margins
    afford attachment to the anterior and posterior ligaments of this articulation.\n\nThe
    Capitulum is a rounded eminence forming the lateral part of the distal humerus.
    The head of the radius articulates with the capitulum.\n\nThe trochlea is spool-shaped
    medial portion of the distal humerus and articulates with the ulna.\n\n\n====
    Epicondyles ====\n\nThe epicondyles are continuous above with the supracondylar
    ridges.\n\nThe lateral epicondyle is a small, tuberculated eminence, curved a
    little forward, and giving attachment to the radial collateral ligament of the
    elbow-joint, and to a tendon common to the origin of the Supinator and some of
    the Extensor muscles.\n\nThe medial epicondyle, larger and more prominent than
    the lateral, is directed a little backward; it gives attachment to the ulnar
    collateral ligament of the elbow-joint, to the Pronator teres, and to a common
    tendon of origin of some of the Flexor muscles of the forearm; the ulnar nerve
    runs in a groove on the back of this epicondyle.\n\nThe Medial supracondylar
    crest forms the sharp medial border of the distal humerus continuing superiorly
    from the medial epicondyle. \n\nThe Lateral Supracondylar crest forms the sharp
    lateral border of the distal humerus continuing superiorly from the lateral epicondyle.\n\n\n====
    Borders ====\n\nThe medial portion of the articular surface is named the trochlea,
    and presents a deep depression between two well-marked borders; it is convex
    from before backward, concave from side to side, and occupies the anterior, lower,
    and posterior parts of the extremity.\n\nThe lateral border separates it from
    the groove which articulates with the margin of the head of the radius.\n\nThe
    medial border is thicker, of greater length, and consequently more prominent,
    than the lateral.\n\nThe grooved portion of the articular surface fits accurately
    within the semilunar notch of the ulna; it is broader and deeper on the posterior
    than on the anterior aspect of the bone, and is inclined obliquely downward and
    forward toward the medial side.\n\n\n=== Articulations ===\n\nAt the shoulder,
    the head of the humerus articulates with the glenoid fossa of the scapula. \n\nMore
    distally, at the elbow, the capitulum of the humerus articulates with the head
    of the radius, and the trochlea of the humerus articulates with the trochlear
    notch of the ulna.\n\n\n=== Nerves ===\n\nThe axillary nerve is located at the
    proximal end, against the shoulder girdle. \n\nDislocation of the humerus's glenohumeral
    joint has the potential to injure the axillary nerve or the axillary artery.
    Signs and symptoms of this dislocation include a loss of the normal shoulder
    contour and a palpable depression under the acromion.\n\nThe radial nerve follows
    the humerus closely. \n\nAt the midshaft of the humerus, the radial nerve travels
    from the posterior to the anterior aspect of the bone in the spiral groove. A
    fracture of the humerus in this region can result in radial nerve injury.\n\nThe
    ulnar nerve lies at the distal end of the humerus near the elbow. \n\nWhen struck,
    it can cause a distinct tingling sensation, and sometimes a significant amount
    of pain. \n\nIt is sometimes popularly referred to as 'the funny bone', possibly
    due to this sensation (a \"funny\" feeling), as well as the fact that the bone's
    name is a homophone of 'humorous'. \n\nIt lies posterior to the medial epicondyle,
    and is easily damaged in elbow injuries.\n\n\n=== Muscular attachment ===\n\nThe
    deltoid originates on the lateral third of the clavicle, acromion and the crest
    of the spine of the scapula. \n\nIt is inserted on the deltoid tuberosity of
    the humerus and has several actions including abduction, extension, and circumduction
    of the shoulder. \n\nThe supraspinatus also originates on the spine of the scapula.
    It inserts on the greater tubercle of the humerus, and assists in abduction of
    the shoulder.\n\nThe pectoralis major, teres major, and latissimus dorsi insert
    at the intertubercular groove of the humerus. \n\nThey work to adduct and medially,
    or internally, rotate the humerus.\n\nThe infraspinatus and teres minor insert
    on the greater tubercle, and work to laterally, or externally, rotate the humerus.
    \n\nIn contrast, the subscapularis muscle inserts onto the lesser tubercle and
    works to medially, or internally, rotate the humerus.\n\nThe biceps brachii,
    brachialis, and brachioradialis (which attaches distally) act to flex the elbow.
    \n\n(The biceps do not attach to the humerus.) The triceps brachii and anconeus
    extend the elbow, and attach to the posterior side of the humerus.\n\nThe four
    muscles of supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor and subscapularis form a
    musculo-ligamentous girdle called the rotator cuff. \n\nThis cuff stabilizes
    the very mobile but inherently unstable glenohumeral joint. \n\nThe other muscles
    are used as counterbalances for the actions of lifting/pulling and pressing/pushing.\n\n\n==
    Other animals ==\n\nPrimitive fossils of amphibians had little, if any, shaft
    connecting the upper and lower extremities, making their limbs very short. \n\nIn
    most living tetrapods, however, the humerus has a similar form to that of humans.
    \n\nIn many reptiles and some primitive mammals, the lower extremity includes
    a large foramen, or opening,  which allows nerves and blood vessels pass through.\n\t\n\t\t\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humerus\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n==
    Ossification ==\n\nDuring embryonic development, the humerus is one of the first
    structures to ossify, beginning with the first ossification center in the shaft
    of the bone. Ossification of the humerus occurs predictably in the embryo and
    fetus, and is therefore used as a fetal biometric measurement when determining
    gestational age of a fetus. At birth, the neonatal humerus is only ossified in
    the shaft. The epiphyses are cartilaginous at birth. The medial humeral head
    develops an ossification center around 4 months of age and the greater tuberosity
    around 10 months of age. These ossification centers begin to fuse at 3 years
    of age. The process of ossification is complete by 13 years of age, though the
    epiphyseal plate (growth plate) persists until skeletal maturity, usually around
    17 years of age.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHumerus fracture\n\n\n== References ==\n\n

  descriptionText: "\n\nFEMUR\n\n\nThe femur (, pl. femurs or femora ), or thigh
    bone, is the proximal bone of the hindlimb in tetrapod vertebrates. \n\nThe head
    of the femur articulates with the acetabulum in the pelvic bone forming the hip
    joint, while the distal part of the femur articulates with the tibia (shinbone)
    and patella (kneecap), forming the knee joint. \n\nBy most measures the two (left
    and right) femurs are the strongest bones of the body, and in humans, the largest
    and thickest.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe femur is the only bone in the upper
    leg. The two femurs converge medially toward the knees, where they articulate
    with the proximal ends of the tibiae. \n\nThe angle of convergence of the femora
    is a major factor in determining the femoral-tibial angle. \n\nHuman females
    have thicker pelvic bones, causing their femora to converge more than in males.\n\nIn
    the condition genu valgum (knock knee) the femurs converge so much that the knees
    touch one another. \n\nThe opposite extreme is genu varum (bow-leggedness). \n\nIn
    the general population of people without either genu valgum or genu varum,  the
    femoral-tibial angle is about 175 degrees.\n\nThe femur is the largest and thickest
    bone in the human body. \n\nBy some measures, it is also the strongest bone in
    the human body. \n\nThis depends on the type of measurement taken to calculate
    strength. \n\nSome strength tests show the temporal bone in the skull to be the
    strongest bone. \n\nThe femur length on average is 26.74% of a person's height,
    a ratio found in both men and women and most ethnic groups with only restricted
    variation, and is useful in anthropology because it offers a basis for a reasonable
    estimate of a subject's height from an incomplete skeleton.\n\nThe femur is categorised
    as a long bone and comprises a diaphysis (shaft or body) and two epiphyses (extremities)
    that articulate with adjacent bones in the hip and knee.\n\n\n=== Upper part
    ===\n\nThe upper or proximal extremity (close to the torso) contains the head,
    neck, the two trochanters and adjacent structures.\n\nThe upper extremity is
    the shortest femoral extremity, the lower extremity is the thickest femoral extremity.\n\nThe
    head of the femur, which articulates with the acetabulum of the pelvic bone,
    comprises two-thirds of a sphere. \n\nIt has a small groove, or fovea, connected
    through the round ligament to the sides of the acetabular notch. \n\nThe head
    of the femur is connected to the shaft through the neck or collum. \n\nThe neck
    is 4\u20135 cm. long and the diameter is smallest front to back and compressed
    at its middle. \n\nThe collum forms an angle with the shaft in about 130 degrees.
    This angle is highly variant. \n\nIn the infant it is about 150 degrees and in
    old age reduced to 120 degrees on average. An abnormal increase in the angle
    is known as coxa valga and an abnormal reduction is called coxa vara. \n\nBoth
    the head and neck of the femur is vastly embedded in the hip musculature and
    can not be directly palpated. \n\nIn skinny people with the thigh laterally rotated,
    the head of the femur can be felt deep as a resistance profound (deep) for the
    femoral artery.\n\nThe transition area between the head and neck is quite rough
    due to attachment of muscles and the hip joint capsule. \n\nHere the two trochanters,
    greater and lesser trochanter, are found.\n\nThe greater trochanter is almost
    box-shaped and is the most lateral prominent of the femur. \n\nThe highest point
    of the greater trochanter is located higher than the collum and reaches the midpoint
    of the hip joint. The greater trochanter can easily be felt. \n\nThe trochanteric
    fossa is a deep depression bounded posteriorly by the intertrochanteric crest
    on the medial surface of the greater trochanter.\n\nThe lesser trochanter is
    a cone-shaped extension of the lowest part of the femur neck. \n\nThe two trochanters
    are joined by the intertrochanteric crest on the back side and by the intertrochanteric
    line on the front.\n\nA slight ridge is sometimes seen commencing about the middle
    of the intertrochanteric crest, and reaching vertically downward for about 5
    cm. along the back part of the body: it is called the linea quadrata (or quadrate
    line).\n\nAbout the junction of the upper one-third and lower two-thirds on the
    intertrochanteric crest is the quadrate tubercle located. \n\nThe size of the
    tubercle varies and it is not always located on the intertrochanteric crest and
    that also adjacent areas can be part of the quadrate tubercle, such as the posterior
    surface of the greater trochanter or the neck of the femur. \n\nIn a small anatomical
    study it was shown that the epiphyseal line passes directly through the quadrate
    tubercle.\n\n\n=== Body ===\n\nThe body of the femur (or shaft) is large, thick
    and almost cylindrical in form. \n\nIt is a little broader above than in the
    center, broadest and somewhat flattened from before backward below. \n\nIt is
    slightly arched, so as to be convex in front, and concave behind, where it is
    strengthened by a prominent longitudinal ridge, the linea aspera which diverges
    proximally and distal as the medial and lateral ridge. \n\nProximally the lateral
    ridge of the linea aspera becomes the gluteal tuberosity while the medial ridge
    continues as the pectineal line. \n\nBesides the linea aspera the shaft has two
    other bordes; a lateral and medial border. \n\nThese three bordes separates the
    shaft into three surfaces: One anterior, one medial and one lateral. \n\nDue
    to the vast musculature of the thigh the shaft can not be palpated.\n\nThe third
    trochanter is a bony projection occasionally present on the proximal femur near
    the superior border of the gluteal tuberosity. \n\nWhen present, it is oblong,
    rounded, or conical in shape and sometimes continuous with the gluteal ridge.
    \n\nA structure of minor importance in humans, the incidence of the third trochanter
    varies from 17\u201372% between ethnic groups and it is frequently reported as
    more common in females than in males.\n\n\n=== Lower part ===\n\nThe lower extremity
    of the femur (or distal extremity) is the thickest femoral extremity, the upper
    extremity is the shortest femoral extremity. \n\nIt is somewhat cuboid in form,
    but its transverse diameter is greater than its antero-posterior (front to back).
    \n\nIt consists of two oblong eminences known as the condyles.\n\nAnteriorly,
    the condyles are slightly prominent and are separated by a smooth shallow articular
    depression called the patellar surface. \n\nPosteriorly, they project considerably
    and a deep notch, the Intercondylar fossa of femur, is present between them.
    \n\nThe lateral condyle is the more prominent and is the broader both in its
    antero-posterior and transverse diameters. \n\nThe medial condyle is the longer
    and, when the femur is held with its body perpendicular, projects to a lower
    level. \n\nWhen, however, the femur is in its natural oblique position the lower
    surfaces of the two condyles lie practically in the same horizontal plane. \n\nThe
    condyles are not quite parallel with one another; the long axis of the lateral
    is almost directly antero-posterior, but that of the medial runs backward and
    medialward. \n\nTheir opposed surfaces are small, rough, and concave, and form
    the walls of the intercondyloid fossa. \n\nThis fossa is limited above by a ridge,
    the intercondyloid line, and below by the central part of the posterior margin
    of the patellar surface. \n\nThe posterior cruciate ligament of the knee joint
    is attached to the lower and front part of the medial wall of the fossa and the
    anterior cruciate ligament to an impression on the upper and back part of its
    lateral wall.\n\nThe articular surface of the lower end of the femur occupies
    the anterior, inferior, and posterior surfaces of the condyles. \n\nIts front
    part is named the patellar surface and articulates with the patella; it presents
    a median groove which extends downward to the intercondyloid fossa and two convexities,
    the lateral of which is broader, more prominent, and extends farther upward than
    the medial.\n\nEach condyle is surmounted by an elevation, the epicondyle. The
    medial epicondyle is a large convex eminence to which the tibial collateral ligament
    of the knee-joint is attached. \n\nAt its upper part is the adductor tubercle
    and behind it is a rough impression which gives origin to the medial head of
    the gastrocnemius. \n\nThe lateral epicondyle which is smaller and less prominent
    than the medial, gives attachment to the fibular collateral ligament of the knee-joint.\n\n\n===
    Development ===\n\nThe femur develops from the limb buds as a result of interactions
    between the ectoderm and the underlying mesoderm, formation occurs roughly around
    the fourth week of development.\n\nBy the sixth week of development, the first
    hyaline cartilage model of the femur is formed by chondrocytes. \n\nEndochondral
    ossification begins by the end of the embryonic period and primary ossification
    centers are present in all long bones of the limbs, including the femur, by the
    12th week of development. \n\nThe hindlimb development lags behind forelimb development
    by 1\u20132 days.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\nAs the femur is the only bone in the
    thigh, it serves as an attachment point for all the muscles that exert their
    force over the hip and knee joints. \n\nSome biarticular muscles \u2013 which
    cross two joints, like the gastrocnemius and plantaris muscles \u2013 also originate
    from the femur. \n\nIn all, 23 individual muscles either originate from or insert
    onto the femur.\n\nIn cross-section, the thigh is divided up into three separate
    fascial compartments divided by fascia, each containing muscles. \n\nThese compartments
    use the femur as an axis, and are separated by tough connective tissue membranes
    (or septa). \n\nEach of these compartments has its own blood and nerve supply,
    and contains a different group of muscles. \n\nThese compartments are named the
    anterior, medial and posterior fascial compartments.\n\n\n=== Fractures ===\n\nA
    femoral fracture that involves the femoral head, femoral neck or the shaft of
    the femur immediately below the lesser trochanter may be classified as a hip
    fracture, especially when associated with osteoporosis.  \n\nFemur fractures
    can be managed in a pre-hospital setting with the use of a traction splint.\n\n\n==
    Diversity among animals ==\n\nIn primitive tetrapods, the main points of muscle
    attachment along the femur are the internal trochanter and third trochanter,
    and a ridge along the ventral surface of the femoral shaft referred to as the
    adductor crest. \n\nThe neck of the femur is generally minimal or absent in the
    most primitive forms, reflecting a simple attachment to the acetabulum. \n\nThe
    greater trochanter was present in the extinct archosaurs, as well as in modern
    birds and mammals, being associated with the loss of the primitive sprawling
    gait. \n\nThe lesser trochanter is a unique development of mammals, which lack
    both the internal and fourth trochanters. \n\nThe adductor crest is also often
    absent in mammals or alternatively reduced to a series of creases along the surface
    of the bone. \n\nStructures analogous to the third trochanter are present in
    mammals, including some primates.\n\nSome species of whales, snakes, and other
    non-walking vertebrates have vestigial femurs. \n\nIn some snakes the protruding
    end of a pelvic spur, a vestigial pelvis and femur remnant which is not connected
    to the rest of the skeleton, plays a role in mating. \n\nThis role in mating
    is hypothesized to have possibly occurred in Basilosauridae, an extinct family
    of whales with well-defined femurs, lower legs and feet. \n\nOccasionally, the
    genes that code for longer extremities cause a modern whale to develop miniature
    legs (atavism).\n\nOne of the earliest known vertebrates to have a femur is the
    eusthenopteron, a prehistoric lobe-finned fish from the Late Devonian period.\n\n\n===
    Invertebrates ===\n\nIn invertebrate zoology the name femur appears in arthropodology.
    \n\nThe usage is not homologous with that of vertebrate anatomy; the term \"femur\"
    simply has been adopted by analogy and refers, where applicable, to the most
    proximal of (usually) the two longest jointed segments of the legs of the arthropoda.
    \n\nThe two basal segments preceding the femur are the coxa and trochanter. \n\nThis
    convention is not followed in carcinology but it applies in arachnology and entomology.
    \n\nIn myriapodology another segment, the prefemur, connects the trochanter and
    femur.\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"

  descriptionText: "\n\nSIXTH RIB\n\n\n== Structure of the rib cage ==\n\nRibs are
    described based on their location and connection with the sternum. \n\nAll ribs
    are attached posteriorly to the thoracic vertebrae and are numbered accordingly
    one to twelve. \n\nRibs that articulate directly with the sternum are called
    true ribs, whereas those that do not articulate directly are termed false ribs.
    \n\n\n=== Attachment of the rib cage ===\n\nThe terms true ribs and false ribs
    describe rib pairs that are directly or indirectly attached to the sternum. \n\nThe
    first seven rib pairs known as the fixed or vertebrosternal ribs are the true
    ribs (Latin: costae verae) as they connect directly to the sternum; the next
    five pairs (eighth to twelfth) are the false ribs (Latin: costae spuriae). \n\n\n===
    Parts of rib (general) ===\n\nEach rib consists of a head, neck, and a shaft.
    \n\nAll ribs are attached posteriorly to the thoracic vertebrae. \n\nThey are
    numbered to match the vertebrae they attach to \u2013 one to twelve, from top
    (T1) to bottom. \n\nThe head of the rib is the end part closest to the vertebra
    with which it articulates. \n\nIt is marked by a kidney-shaped articular surface
    which is divided by a horizontal crest into two articulating regions. \n\nThe
    upper region articulates with the inferior costal facet on the vertebra above,
    and the larger region articulates with the superior costal facet on the vertebra
    with the same number. \n\nThe transverse process of a thoracic vertebra also
    articulates at the transverse costal facet with the tubercle of the rib of the
    same number. \n\nThe crest gives attachment to the intra-articular ligament.The
    neck of the rib is the flattened part that extends laterally from the head. \n\nThe
    neck is about 3 cm long. \n\nIts anterior surface is flat and smooth, whilst
    its posterior is perforated by numerous foramina and its surface rough, to give
    attachment to the ligament of the neck. \n\nIts upper border presents a rough
    crest (crista colli costae) for the attachment of the anterior costotransverse
    ligament; its lower border is rounded.\n\nOn the posterior surface at the neck,
    is an eminence\u2014the tubercle that consists of an articular and a non-articular
    portion. \n\nThe articular portion is the lower and more medial of the two and
    presents a small, oval surface for articulation with the transverse costal facet
    on the end of the transverse process of the lower of the two vertebrae to which
    the head is connected. \n\nThe non-articular portion is a rough elevation and
    affords attachment to the ligament of the tubercle. \n\nThe tubercle is much
    more prominent in the upper ribs than in the lower ribs.\n\nThe angle of a rib
    (costal angle) may both refer to the bending part of it, and a prominent line
    in this area, a little in front of the tubercle. \n\nThis line is directed downward
    and laterally; this gives attachment to a tendon of the iliocostalis muscle.
    \n\nAt this point, the rib is bent in two directions, and at the same time twisted
    on its long axis.\n\nThe distance between the angle and the tubercle is progressively
    greater from the second to the tenth ribs. \n\nThe area between the angle and
    the tubercle is rounded, rough, and irregular, and serves for the attachment
    of the longissimus dorsi muscle.\n\n\n==== Ribs and vertebrae ====\n\nThe first
    rib (the topmost one) is the most curved and usually the shortest of all the
    ribs; it is broad and flat, its surfaces looking upward and downward, and its
    borders inward and outward.\n        \nThe head is small and rounded, and possesses
    only a single articular facet, for articulation with the body of the first thoracic
    vertebra. \n\nThe neck is narrow and rounded. \n\nThe tubercle, thick and prominent,
    is placed on the outer border. \n\nIt bears a small facet for articulation with
    the transverse costal facet on the transverse process of T1. \n\nThere is no
    angle, but at the tubercle, the rib is slightly bent, with the convexity upward,
    so that the head of the bone is directed downward. \n\nThe upper surface of the
    body is marked by two shallow grooves, separated from each other by a slight
    ridge prolonged internally into a tubercle, the scalene tubercle, for the attachment
    of the anterior scalene; the anterior groove transmits the subclavian vein, the
    posterior the subclavian artery and the lowest trunk of the brachial plexus.
    \n\nBehind the posterior groove is a rough area for the attachment of the medial
    scalene. \n\nThe under surface is smooth and without a costal groove. \n\nThe
    outer border is convex, thick, and rounded, and at its posterior part gives attachment
    to the first digitation of the serratus anterior. \n\nThe inner border is concave,
    thin, and sharp, and marked about its center by the scalene tubercle. \n\nThe
    anterior extremity is larger and thicker than that of any of the other ribs.\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rib_cage"

  descriptionText: "\n\nLACRIMAL BONE\n\n\nThe lacrimal bone is a small and fragile
    bone of the facial skeleton; it is roughly the size of the little fingernail.
    \n\nIt is situated at the front part of the medial wall of the orbit. \n\nIt
    has two surfaces and four borders. \n\nSeveral bony landmarks of the lacrimal
    bone function in the process of lacrimation or crying. \n\nSpecifically, the
    lacrimal bone helps form the nasolacrimal canal necessary for tear translocation.
    \n\nA depression on the anterior inferior portion of the bone, the lacrimal fossa,
    houses the membranous lacrimal sac. \n\nTears or lacrimal fluid, from the lacrimal
    glands, collect in this sac during excessive lacrimation. \n\nThe fluid then
    flows through the nasolacrimal duct and into the nasopharynx. \n\nThis drainage
    results in what is commonly referred to a runny nose during excessive crying
    or tear production. \n\nInjury or fracture of the lacrimal bone can result in
    posttraumatic obstruction of the lacrimal pathways.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\n===
    Lateral or orbital surface ===\n\nThe lateral or orbital surface is divided by
    a vertical ridge, the posterior lacrimal crest, into two parts.\nIn front of
    this crest is a longitudinal groove, the lacrimal sulcus (sulcus lacrimalis),
    the inner margin of which unites with the frontal process of the maxilla, and
    the lacrimal fossa is thus completed. \n\nThe upper part of this fossa lodges
    the lacrimal sac, the lower part, the nasolacrimal duct.\nThe portion behind
    the crest is smooth, and forms part of the medial wall of the orbit.\nThe crest,
    with a part of the orbital surface immediately behind it, gives origin to the
    lacrimal part of the orbicularis oculi and ends below in a small, hook-like projection,
    the lacrimal hamulus, which articulates with the lacrimal tubercle of the maxilla,
    and completes the upper orifice of the nasolacrimal canal; the hamulus sometimes
    exists as a separate piece, and is then called the lesser lacrimal bone.\n\n\n===
    Medial or nasal surface ===\n\nThe medial or nasal surface presents a longitudinal
    furrow, corresponding to the crest on the lateral surface.\nThe area in front
    of this furrow forms part of the middle meatus of the nose. \n\nThe area behind
    it articulates with the ethmoid, and completes some of the anterior ethmoidal
    cells.\n\n\n=== Borders ===\n\nOf the four borders:\n\nthe anterior articulates
    with the frontal process of the maxilla;\nthe posterior with the lamina papyracea
    of the ethmoid;\nthe superior with the frontal bone.\nThe inferior is divided
    by the lower edge of the posterior lacrimal crest into two parts:\nthe posterior
    part articulates with the orbital plate of the maxilla;\nthe anterior is prolonged
    downward as the descending process, which articulates with the lacrimal process
    of the inferior nasal concha, and assists in forming the canal for the nasolacrimal
    duct.\n\n\n=== Development ===\n\nThe lacrimal is ossified from a single center,
    which appears about the twelfth week in the membrane covering the cartilaginous
    nasal capsule.\n\n\n=== Articulations ===\n\nThe lacrimal articulates with four
    bones: two of the cranium, the frontal and ethmoid, and two of the face, the
    maxilla and the inferior nasal concha.\n\n\n== Other animals ==\n\nIn early lobe-finned
    fishes and ancestral tetrapods, the lacrimal bone is a relatively large and robust
    bone, running from the orbit to the nostrils. \n\nIt forms part of the side of
    the face, between the nasal bones and the maxilla. \n\nIn primitive forms, it
    is often accompanied by a much smaller septomaxilla bone, lying immediately behind
    the nasal opening, but this is lost in most modern species. \n\nThe lacrimal
    bone is often smaller in living vertebrates, and is no longer always directly
    associated with the nasal opening, although it retains its connection with the
    orbit. \n\nThe bone is entirely absent in living amphibians, as well as some
    reptilian species.\n\n\n=== Dinosaurs ===\n\nIn dinosaurs, the lacrimal bone
    usually defines the anterior rim of the orbit (eye socket), and the posterior
    rim of the antorbital fenestra. \n\nIn some theropods (e.g. \n\nAllosaurus, Ceratosaurus,
    Albertosaurus) the upper part of the lacrimal bone grew in such a manner as to
    form a horn on the top of the dinosaur's head, usually situated above, and anterior
    to the eye. \n\nIn many dinosaurs, the lacrimal bone comes into contact with
    the nasal bone, the jugal bone, the prefrontal bone, and the maxillary and premaxillary
    bones. \n\nThe boundaries where some of these bones meet with the others are
    called sutures. \n\nRarely, the lacrimal bones fused with the nasal bones to
    form a pair of \"nasolacrimal\" crests, which are present in dinosaurs such as
    Dilophosaurus, Megapnosaurus and Sinosaurus.\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lacrimal_bone"

  descriptionText: "\n\nMETATARSAL BONES\n\n\nThe metatarsal bones, or metatarsus
    are a group of five long bones in the foot, located between the tarsal bones
    of the hind- and mid-foot and the phalanges of the toes. \n\nLacking individual
    names, the metatarsal bones are numbered from the medial side (the side of the
    great toe): the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth metatarsal (often depicted
    with Roman numerals). \n\nThe metatarsals are analogous to the metacarpal bones
    of the hand. \n\nThe lengths of the metatarsal bones in humans are, in descending
    order: second, third, fourth, fifth and first.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe five
    metatarsals are dorsally convex long bones consisting of a shaft or body, a base
    (proximally), and a head (distally). \n\nThe body is prismoid in form, tapers
    gradually from the tarsal to the phalangeal extremity, and is curved longitudinally,
    so as to be concave below, slightly convex above. \n\nThe base or posterior extremity
    is wedge-shaped, articulating proximally with the tarsal bones, and by its sides
    with the contiguous metatarsal bones: its dorsal and plantar surfaces are rough
    for the attachment of ligaments. \n\nThe head or distal extremity presents a
    convex articular surface, oblong from above downward, and extending farther backward
    below than above. \n\nIts sides are flattened, and on each is a depression, surmounted
    by a tubercle, for ligamentous attachment. \n\nIts plantar surface is grooved
    antero-posteriorly for the passage of the flexor tendons, and marked on either
    side by an articular eminence continuous with the terminal articular surface.\n\nDuring
    growth, the growth plates are located distally on the metatarsals, except on
    the first metatarsal where it is located proximally. \n\nYet it is quite common
    to have an accessory growth plate on the distal first metatarsal.\n\n\n=== Articulations
    ===\n\n\nThe base of each metatarsal bone articulates with one or more of the
    tarsal bones at the tarsometatarsal joints, and the head with one of the first
    row of phalanges at the metatarsophalangeal joints. \n\nTheir bases also articulate
    with each other at the intermetatarsal joints\n\n-The first metatarsal articulates
    with the medial cuneiform, and to a small extent to the intermediate cuneiform.\n-the
    second with all three cuneiforms.\n-the third with the lateral cuneiform.\n-the
    fourth with the lateral cuneiform and the cuboid.\n-The fifth with the cuboid.\n\n\n==
    Clinical significance ==\n\n=== Injuries ===\n\nThe metatarsal bones are often
    broken by association football players. \n\nThese and other recent cases have
    been attributed to the lightweight design of modern football boots, which provide
    less protection to the foot. \n\nIn 2010 some soccer players began testing a
    new sock that incorporated a rubber silicone pad over the foot to provide protection
    to the top of the foot. \n\nStress fractures are thought to account for 16% of
    injuries related to sports participation, and the metatarsals are the bones most
    often involved. \n\nThese fractures are sometimes called march fractures, based
    on their traditional association with military recruits after long marches. \n\nThe
    second and third metatarsals are fixed while walking, thus these metatarsals
    are common sites of injury. \n\nThe fifth metatarsal may be fractured if the
    foot is oversupinated during locomotion.Protection from injuries can be given
    by the use of safety footwear which can use built-in or removable metatarsal
    guards.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metatarsal_bones"

  descriptionText: "\n\nMETACARPAL BONES\n\n\nIn human anatomy, the metacarpal bones
    or metacarpus, form the intermediate part of the skeletal hand located between
    the phalanges of the fingers and the carpal bones of the wrist which forms the
    connection to the forearm. \n\nThe metacarpal bones are analogous to the metatarsal
    bones in the foot.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\n\nThe metacarpals form a transverse
    arch to which the rigid row of distal carpal bones are fixed. \n\nThe peripheral
    metacarpals (those of the thumb and little finger) form the sides of the cup
    of the palmar gutter and as they are brought together they deepen this concavity.
    \n\nThe index metacarpal is the most firmly fixed, while the thumb metacarpal
    articulates with the trapezium and acts independently from the others. \n\nThe
    middle metacarpals are tightly united to the carpus by intrinsic interlocking
    bone elements at their bases. \n\nThe ring metacarpal is somewhat more mobile
    while the fifth metacarpal is semi-independent.Each metacarpal bone consists
    of a body or shaft, and two extremities: the head at the distal or digital end
    (near the fingers), and the base at the proximal or carpal end (close to the
    wrist).\n\n\n=== Body ===\n\nThe body (shaft) is prismoid in form, and curved,
    so as to be convex in the longitudinal direction behind, concave in front. \n\nIt
    presents three surfaces: medial, lateral, and dorsal.\n\nThe medial and lateral
    surfaces are concave, for the attachment of the interosseus muscles, and separated
    from one another by a prominent anterior ridge.\n\nThe dorsal surface presents
    in its distal two-thirds a smooth, triangular, flattened area which is covered
    in by the tendons of the extensor muscles. \n\nThis surface is bounded by two
    lines, which commence in small tubercles situated on either side of the digital
    extremity, and, passing upward, converge and meet some distance above the center
    of the bone and form a ridge which runs along the rest of the dorsal surface
    to the carpal extremity. \n\nThis ridge separates two sloping surfaces for the
    attachment of the interossei dorsales.\n\nTo the tubercles on the digital extremities
    are attached the collateral ligaments of the metacarpophalangeal joints.\n\n\n===
    Base ===\n\nThe base (basis) or carpal extremity is of a cuboidal form, and broader
    behind than in front: it articulates with the carpal bones and with the adjoining
    metacarpal bones; its dorsal and volar surfaces are rough, for the attachment
    of ligaments.\n\n\n=== Head ===\n\nThe head (caput) or digital extremity presents
    an oblong surface markedly convex from before backward, less so transversely,
    and flattened from side to side; it articulates with the proximal phalanx. \n\nIt
    is broader, and extends farther upward, on the volar than on the dorsal aspect,
    and is longer in the antero-posterior than in the transverse diameter. \n\nOn
    either side of the head is a tubercle for the attachment of the collateral ligament
    of the metacarpophalangeal joint.\n\nThe dorsal surface, broad and flat, supports
    the tendons of the extensor muscles.\n\nThe volar surface is grooved in the middle
    line for the passage of the flexor tendons, and marked on either side by an articular
    eminence continuous with the terminal articular surface.\n\n\n=== Neck ===\n\nThe
    neck, or subcapital segment, is the transition zone between the body and the
    head.\n\n\n=== Articulations ===\n\nBesides the metacarpophalangeal joints, the
    metacarpal bones articulate by carpometacarpal joints as follows:\n\n-the first
    with the trapezium;\n-the second with the trapezium, trapezoid, capitate and
    third metacarpal;\n-the third with the capitate and second and fourth metacarpals;\n-the
    fourth with the capitate, hamate, and third and fifth metacarpals;\n-and the
    fifth with the hamate and fourth metacarpal;\n        \n\n\n=== Insertions ===\n\n-Extensor
    Carpi Radialis Longus/Brevis: Both insert on the base of metacarpal II; Assist
    with wrist extension and radial flexion of the wrist\n-Extensor Carpi Ulnaris:
    Inserts on the base of metacarpal V; Extends and fixes wrist when digits are
    being flexed; assists with ulnar flexion of wrist\n-Abductor Pollicis Longus:
    Inserts on the trapezium and base of metacarpal I; Abducts thumb in frontal plane;
    extends thumb at carpometacarpal joint\n-Opponens Pollicis: Inserts on metacarpal
    I; flexes metacarpal I to oppose the thumb to the fingertips\n-Opponens digiti
    minimi: Inserts on the medial surface of metacarpal V; Flexes metacarpal V at
    carpometacarpal joint when little finger is moved into opposition with tip of
    thumb; deepens palm of hand.\n\n        \n\n\n== Clinical significance ==\n\n===
    Congenital disorders ===\n\nThe fourth and fifth metacarpal bones are commonly
    \"blunted\" or shortened, in pseudohypoparathyroidism and pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism.\n\nA
    blunted fourth metacarpal, with normal fifth metacarpal, can signify Turner syndrome.\n\nBlunted
    metacarpals (particularly the fourth metacarpal) are a symptom of Nevoid basal
    cell carcinoma syndrome.\n\n\n=== Fracture ===\n\nThe neck of a metacarpal is
    a common location for a boxer's fracture. \n\nHowever, all parts of the metacarpal
    bone (including head, body and base) are susceptible to fracture. \n\nFor these
    fractures several types of treatment exist ranging from non-operative techniques
    with or without immobilization to operative techniques using closed or open reduction
    and internal fixation (ORIF). \n\nGenerally speaking most fractures showing little
    or no displacement can be treated successfully without surgery. \n\nIntraarticular
    fracture-dislocations of the metacarpal head or base may require surgical fixation,
    as fragment displacement affecting the joint surface is rarely tolerated well.\n\n\n==
    Other animals ==\n\nIn four-legged animals, the metacarpals form part of the
    forefeet, and are frequently reduced in number, appropriate to the number of
    toes. \n\nIn digitigrade and unguligrade animals, the metacarpals are greatly
    extended and strengthened, forming an additional segment to the limb, a feature
    that typically enhances the animal's speed. \n\nIn both birds and bats, the metacarpals
    form part of the wing.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Etymology ===\n\nThe Greek physician
    Galen used to refer to the metacarpus as \u03BC\u03B5\u03C4\u03B1\u03BA\u03AC\u03C1\u03C0\u03B9\u03BF\u03BD.
    \n\nThe Latin form metacarpium more truly resembles its Ancient Greek predecessor
    \u03BC\u03B5\u03C4\u03B1\u03BA\u03AC\u03C1\u03C0\u03B9\u03BF\u03BD than metacarpus.
    \n\nMeta\u2013 is Greek for beyond and carpal from Ancient Greek \u03BA\u03B1\u03C1\u03C0\u03CC\u03C2
    (karp\xF3s, \u201Cwrist\u201D).\n\nIn anatomic Latin, adjectives like metacarpius,
    metacarpicus, metacarpiaeus, metacarpeus, metacarpianus and metacarpalis can
    be found. \n\nThe form metacarpius is more true to the later Greek form \u03BC\u03B5\u03C4\u03B1\u03BA\u03AC\u03C1\u03C0\u03B9\u03BF\u03C2.
    \n\nMetacarpalis, as in ossa metacarpalia in the current official Latin nomenclature,
    Terminologia Anatomica is a compound consisting of Latin and Greek parts. \n\nThe
    usage of such hybrids in anatomic Latin is disapproved by some.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacarpal_bones"

  descriptionText: "\n\nPREMOLAR\n\n\nThe premolars, also called premolar teeth,
    or bicuspids, are transitional teeth located between the canine and molar teeth.
    \n\nIn humans, there are two premolars per quadrant in the permanent set of teeth,
    making eight premolars total in the mouth. \n\nThey have at least two cusps.
    \n\nPremolars can be considered transitional teeth during chewing, or mastication.
    \n\nThey have properties of both the canines, that lay anterior and molars that
    lay posterior, and so food can be transferred from the canines to the premolars
    and finally to the molars for grinding, instead of directly from the canines
    to the molars.\n\n\n== Human anatomy ==\n\nThe premolars in humans are the maxillary
    first premolar, maxillary second premolar, mandibular first premolar, and the
    mandibular second premolar. \n\nPremolar teeth by definition are permanent teeth
    distal to the canines, preceded by deciduous molars.\n\n\n=== Morphology ===\n\nThere
    is always one large buccal cusp, especially so in the mandibular first premolar.
    \n\nThe lower second premolar almost always presents with two lingual cusps.The
    lower premolars and the upper second premolar usually have one root. \n\nThe
    upper first usually has two roots, but can have just one root, notably in Sinodonts,
    and can sometimes have three roots.Premolars are unique to the permanent dentition.
    \n\nPremolars are referred to as bicuspid (has two main cusps), a buccal and
    a palatal/lingual cusp which are separated by a mesiodistal occlusal fissure.\nThe
    maxillary premolars are trapezoidal in shape. \n\nWhilst the mandibular premolars
    are rhomboidal in shape.\n\n\n==== Maxillary first premolar ====\nThe crown of
    the tooth appears ovoid, wider buccally than palatally\nFrom a buccal view, the
    first premolar is similar to the adjacent canine\nRoots: Two roots buccal and
    palatal. \n\nSometimes (40%) there is only one root.\n\n\n==== Maxillary second
    premolar ====\nSimilar to maxillary first premolar but the mesio-buccal and disto-buccal
    corners are rounder\nThe two cusps are smaller and more equal in size\nShorter
    occlusal fissure\nUsually one root\n\n\n==== Mandibular first premolar ====\n\n-The
    smallest premolar out of all four\n-Dominant buccal cusp and a very small lingual
    cusp\n-The buccal cusp is broad and the lingual cusp is less than half the size
    of the buccal cusp.\n-Two-thirds of the buccal surface can be seen from the occlusal
    aspect\n-A single conical root with an oval/round cross section. \n-The root
    is grooved longitudinally both mesially and distally.\n\n\n==== Mandibular second
    premolar ====\n\nThe crown is larger than the mandibular first premolar\nLingual
    cusp is smaller than the buccal cusp but better developed.\n\nThe lingual and
    buccal cusp is separated by a well defined mesiodistal occlusal fissure\n\nThe
    lingual cusp is divided into two; the mesiolingual and distolingual cusps with
    the mesiolingual cusp being higher and wider than the distolingual.\n\nRoot:
    Single conical root, oval/round in cross section.\n\n\n== Orthodontics ==\n\nThe
    four first premolars are the most commonly removed teeth, in 48.8% of cases,
    when teeth are removed for orthodontic treatment (which is in 45.8% of orthodontic
    patients). \n\nThe removal of only the maxillary first premolars is the second
    likeliest option, in 14.5% of cases.\n\n\n== Other mammals ==\n\nIn primitive
    placental mammals there are four premolars per quadrant, but the most mesial
    two (closer to the front of the mouth) have been lost in catarrhines (Old World
    monkeys and apes, including humans). \n\nPaleontologists therefore refer to human
    premolars as Pm3 and Pm4.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premolar"

    premolar ====\n\nThe crown is larger than the mandibular first premolar\nLingual
    cusp is smaller than the buccal cusp but better developed.\n\nThe lingual and
    buccal cusp is separated by a well defined mesiodistal occlusal fissure\n\nThe
    lingual cusp is divided into two; the mesiolingual and distolingual cusps with
    the mesiolingual cusp being higher and wider than the distolingual.\n\nRoot:
    Single conical root, oval/round in cross section.\n\n\n== Orthodontics ==\n\nThe
    four first premolars are the most commonly removed teeth, in 48.8% of cases,
    when teeth are removed for orthodontic treatment (which is in 45.8% of orthodontic
    patients). \n\nThe removal of only the maxillary first premolars is the second
    likeliest option, in 14.5% of cases.\n\n\n== Other mammals ==\n\nIn primitive
    placental mammals there are four premolars per quadrant, but the most mesial
    two (closer to the front of the mouth) have been lost in catarrhines (Old World
    monkeys and apes, including humans). \n\nPaleontologists therefore refer to human
    premolars as Pm3 and Pm4.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premolar"

    is the upper fixed (not fixed in Neopterygii) bone of the jaw formed from the
    fusion of two maxillary bones. \n\nIn humans, the upper jaw includes the hard
    palate in the front of the mouth.\n\nThe two maxillary bones are fused at the
    intermaxillary suture, forming the anterior nasal spine. \n\nThis is similar
    to the mandible (lower jaw), which is also a fusion of two mandibular bones at
    the mandibular symphysis. \n\nThe mandible is the movable part of the jaw.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxilla"

  descriptionText: "\n\nCLAVICLE\n\n\nThe clavicle, or collarbone, is a slender,
    S-shaped long bone approximately 6 inches (15 cm) long that serves as a strut
    between the shoulder blade and the sternum (breastbone).\n\nThere are two clavicles,
    one on the left and one on the right.\n\nThe clavicle is the only long bone in
    the body that lies horizontally.\nTogether with the shoulder blade, it makes
    up the shoulder girdle.\n\nIt is a touchable bone, and in people who have less
    fat in this region, the location of the bone is clearly visible, as it creates
    a bulge in the skin.\n\nIt receives its name from the Latin clavicula (\"little
    key\"), because the bone rotates along its axis like a key when the shoulder
    is abducted.\n\nThe clavicle is the most commonly fractured bone.\n\nIt can easily
    be fractured by impacts to the shoulder from the force of falling on outstretched
    arms or by a direct hit.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe collarbone is a thin doubly
    curved long bone that connects the arm to the trunk of the body.\n\nLocated directly
    above the first rib, it acts as a strut to keep the scapula in place so that
    the arm can hang freely.\n\nAt its rounded medial end (sternal end), it articulates
    with the manubrium of the sternum (breastbone) at the sternoclavicular joint.\n\nAt
    its flattened lateral end (acromial end), it articulates with the acromion, a
    process of the scapula (shoulder blade), at the acromioclavicular joint.\n\nThe
    rounded medial region (sternal region) of the shaft has a long curve laterally
    and anteriorly along two-thirds of the entire shaft.\n\nThe flattened lateral
    region (acromial region) of the shaft has an even larger posterior curve to articulate
    with the acromion of the scapula.\n\nThe medial region is the longest clavicular
    region as it takes up two-thirds of the entire shaft.\n\nThe lateral region is
    both the widest clavicular region and thinnest clavicular region.\n\nThe lateral
    end has a rough inferior surface that bears a ridge, the trapezoid line, and
    a slight rounded projection, the conoid tubercle (above the coracoid process).\n\nThese
    surface features are attachment sites for muscles and ligaments of the shoulder.\n\nIt
    can be divided into three parts: medial end, lateral end, and shaft.\n\n\n===
    Medial end ===\n\nThe medial end is also known as the sternal end.\n\nIt is quadrangular
    and articulates with the clavicular notch of the manubrium of the sternum to
    form the sternoclavicular joint.\n\nThe articular surface extends to the inferior
    aspect for articulation with the first costal cartilage.\n\n\n=== Lateral end
    ===\n\nThe lateral end is also known as the acromial end.\n\nIt is flat from
    above downward.\n\nIt bears a facet that articulates with the shoulder to form
    the acromioclavicular joint.\n\nThe area surrounding the joint gives an attachment
    to the joint capsule.\n\nThe anterior border is concave forward and the posterior
    border is convex backward.\n\n\n=== Shaft ===\n\nThe shaft is divided into two
    main regions, the medial region, and the lateral region.\n\nThe medial region
    is also known as the sternal region, it is the longest clavicular region as it
    takes up two-thirds of the entire shaft.\n\nThe lateral region is also known
    as the acromial region, it is both the widest clavicular region and thinnest
    clavicular region.\n\n\n==== Lateral region of the shaft ====\n\nThe lateral
    region of the shaft has two borders and two surfaces.\n\n-the anterior border
    is concave forward and gives origin to the deltoid muscle.\n-the posterior border
    is convex and gives attachment to the trapezius muscle.\n-the inferior surface
    has a ridge called the trapezoid line and a tubercle; the conoid tubercle for
    attachment with the trapezoid and the conoid ligament, part of the coracoclavicular
    ligament that serves to connect the collarbone with the coracoid process of the
    scapula.\n\n\n=== Development ===\n\nThe collarbone is the first bone to begin
    the process of ossification (laying down of minerals onto a preformed matrix)
    during development of the embryo, during the fifth and sixth weeks of gestation.\n\nHowever,
    it is one of the last bones to finish ossification at about 21\u201325 years
    of age.\n\nIts lateral end is formed by intramembranous ossification while medially
    it is formed by endochondral ossification.\n\nIt consists of a mass of cancellous
    bone surrounded by a compact bone shell.\n\nThe cancellous bone forms via two
    ossification centres, one medial and one lateral, which fuse later on.\n\nThe
    compact forms as the layer of fascia covering the bone stimulate the ossification
    of adjacent tissue.\n\nThe resulting compact bone is known as a periosteal collar.\n\nEven
    though it is classified as a long bone, the collarbone has no medullary cavity 
    (marrow cavity) like other long bones, though this is not always true.\n\nIt
    is made up of spongy cancellous bone with a shell of compact bone.\n\nIt is a
    dermal bone derived from elements originally attached to the skull.\n\n\n===
    Variation ===\n\nThe shape of the clavicle varies more than most other long bones.\n\nIt
    is occasionally pierced by a branch of the supraclavicular nerve.\n\nIn males
    the clavicle is usually longer and larger than in females.\n\nA study measuring
    748 males and 252 females saw a difference in collarbone length between age groups
    18\u201320 and 21\u201325 of about 6 and 5 mm (0.24 and 0.20 in) for males and
    females respectively.\n\nThe left clavicle is usually longer and weaker than
    the right clavicle.\n\nThe collarbones are sometimes partly or completely absent
    in cleidocranial dysostosis.\n\nThe levator claviculae muscle, present in 2\u20133%
    of people, originates on the transverse processes of the upper cervical vertebrae
    and is inserted in the lateral half of the clavicle.\n\n\n== Functions ==\n\nThe
    collarbone serves several functions:\n    \nIt serves as a rigid support from
    which the scapula and free limb suspended; an arrangement that keeps the upper
    limb away from the thorax so that the arm has maximum range of movement.\n\nActing
    as a flexible, crane-like strut, it allows the scapula to move freely on the
    thoracic wall.\n\nCovering the cervicoaxillary canal, it protects the neurovascular
    bundle that supplies the upper limb.\n\nTransmits physical impacts from the upper
    limb to the axial skeleton.\n\n\n=== Muscle ===\n\nMuscles and ligaments that
    attach to the collarbone include:\n\n\n== Clinical significance ==\n\n-Acromioclavicular
    dislocation (\"AC Separation\")\n-Degeneration of the clavicle\n-Osteolysis\n-Sternoclavicular
    dislocationsA vertical line drawn from the mid-clavicle called the mid-clavicular
    line is used as a reference in describing cardiac apex beat during medical examination.\n-It
    is also useful for evaluating an enlarged liver, and for locating the gallbladder
    which is between the mid-clavicular line and the transpyloric plane.\n\n\n===
    Collarbone fracture ===\n\nClavicle fractures (colloquially, a broken collarbone)
    occur as a result of injury or trauma.\n\nThe most common type of fractures occur
    when a person falls horizontally on the shoulder or with an outstretched hand.\n\nA
    direct hit to the collarbone will also cause a break.\n\nIn most cases, the direct
    hit occurs from the lateral side towards the medial side of the bone.\n\nThe
    most common site of fracture is the junction between the two curvatures of the
    bone, which is the weakest point.\n\nThis results in the sternocleidomastoid
    muscle lifting the medial aspect superiorly, which can result in perforation
    of the overlying skin.\n\n\n== Other animals ==\n\nThe clavicle first appears
    as part of the skeleton in primitive bony fish, where it is associated with the
    pectoral fin; they also have a bone called the cleithrum.\n\nIn such fish, the
    paired clavicles run behind and below the gills on each side, and are joined
    by a solid symphysis on the fish's underside.\n\nThey are, however, absent in
    cartilaginous fish and in the vast majority of living bony fish, including all
    of the teleosts.\n\nThe earliest tetrapods retained this arrangement, with the
    addition of a diamond-shaped interclavicle between the base of the clavicles,
    although this is not found in living amphibians.\n\nThe cleithrum disappeared
    early in the evolution of reptiles, and is not found in any living amniotes,
    but the interclavicle is present in most modern reptiles, and also in monotremes.\n\nIn
    modern forms, however, there are a number of variations from the primitive pattern.\n\nFor
    example, crocodilians and salamanders lack clavicles altogether (although crocodilians
    do retain the interclavicle), while in turtles, they form part of the armoured
    plastron.The interclavicle is absent in marsupials and placental mammals.\n\nIn
    many mammals, the clavicles are also reduced, or even absent, to allow the scapula
    greater freedom of motion, which may be useful in fast-running animals.\n\nThough
    a number of fossil hominin (humans and chimpanzees) clavicles have been found,
    most of these are mere segments offering limited information on the form and
    function of the pectoral girdle.\n\nOne exception is the clavicle of AL 333x6/9
    attributed to Australopithecus afarensis which has a well-preserved sternal end.\n\nOne
    interpretation of this specimen, based on the orientation of its lateral end
    and the position of the deltoid attachment area, suggests that this clavicle
    is distinct from those found in extant apes (including humans), and thus that
    the shape of the human shoulder dates back to less than 3 to 4 million years
    ago.\n\nHowever, analyses of the clavicle in extant primates suggest that the
    low position of the scapula in humans is reflected mostly in the curvature of
    the medial portion of the clavicle rather than the lateral portion.\n\nThis part
    of the bone is similar in A.afarensis and it is thus possible that this species
    had a high shoulder position similar to that in modern humans.\n\n\n=== In dinosaurs
    ===\n\nIn dinosaurs the main bones of the pectoral girdle were the scapula (shoulder
    blade) and the coracoid, both of which directly articulated with the clavicle.\n\nThe
    clavicle was present in saurischian dinosaurs but largely absent in ornithischian
    dinosaurs.\n\nThe place on the scapula where it articulated with the humerus
    (upper bone of the forelimb) is the called the glenoid.\n\nThe clavicles fused
    in some theropod dinosaurs to form a furcula, which is the equivalent to a wishbone.In
    birds, the clavicles and interclavicle have fused to form a single Y-shaped bone,
    the furcula or \"wishbone\" which evolved from the clavicles found in coelurosaurian
    theropods.\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clavicle"

  descriptionText: "\n\nSTAPES\n\n\nThe stapes or stirrup is a bone in the middle
    ear of humans and other animals which is involved in the conduction of sound
    vibrations to the inner ear. \n\nThis bone is connected to the oval window by
    its annular ligament, which allows the footplate to transmit sound energy through
    the oval window into the inner ear. \n\nThe stapes is the smallest and lightest
    bone in the human body, and is so-called because of its resemblance to a stirrup
    (Latin: Stapes).\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\n\nThe stapes is the third bone of the
    three ossicles in the middle ear and the smallest in the human body. \n\nIt measures
    roughly 2 to 3 mm, greater along the head-base span. \n\nIt rests on the oval
    window, to which it is connected by an annular ligament and articulates with
    the incus, or anvil through the incudostapedial joint. \n\nThey are connected
    by anterior and posterior limbs (Latin: crura).:\u200A862\u200A\n\n\n=== Development
    ===\n\nThe stapes develops from the second pharyngeal arch during the sixth to
    eighth week of embryological life. \n\nThe central cavity of the stapes, the
    obturator foramen, is due to the presence embryologically of the stapedial artery,
    which usually regresses in humans during normal development.\n\n\n=== Animals
    ===\n\n\nThe stapes is one of three ossicles in mammals. \n\nIn non-mammalian
    four-legged animals, the bone homologous to the stapes is usually called the
    columella; however, in reptiles, either term may be used. \n\nIn fish, the homologous
    bone is called the hyomandibular, and is part of the gill arch supporting either
    the spiracle or the jaw, depending on the species. \n\nThe equivalent term in
    amphibians is the pars media plectra.:\u200A481\u2013482\u200A\n\n\n=== Variation
    ===\n\nThe stapes appears to be relatively constant in size in different ethnic
    groups. \n\nIn 0.01\u20130.02% of people, the stapedial artery does not regress,
    and persists in the central foramen. \n\nIn this case, a pulsatile sound may
    be heard in the affected ear, or there may be no symptoms at all. \n\nRarely,
    the stapes may be completely absent.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\n\nSituated between
    the incus and the inner ear, the stapes transmits sound vibrations from the incus
    to the oval window, a membrane-covered opening to the inner ear. \n\nThe stapes
    is also stabilized by the stapedius muscle, which is innervated by the facial
    nerve.:\u200A861\u2013863\u200A\n\n\n== Clinical relevance ==\n\nOtosclerosis
    is a congenital or spontaneous-onset disease characterized by abnormal bone remodeling
    in the inner ear. \n\nOften this causes the stapes to adhere to the oval window,
    which impedes its ability to conduct sound, and is a cause of conductive hearing
    loss. \n\nClinical otosclerosis is found in about 1% of people, although it is
    more common in forms that do not cause noticeable hearing loss. \n\nOtosclerosis
    is more likely in young age groups, and females. \n\nTwo common treatments are
    stapedectomy, the surgical removal of the stapes and replacement with an artificial
    prosthesis, and stapedotomy, the creation of a small hole in the base of the
    stapes followed by the insertion of an artificial prosthesis into that hole.\u200A
    \n\nSurgery may be complicated by a persistent stapedial artery, fibrosis-related
    damage to the base of the bone, or obliterative otosclerosis, resulting in obliteration
    of the base. :\u200A254\u2013262\u200A\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\nThe stapes is
    commonly described as having been discovered by the professor Giovanni Filippo
    Ingrassia in 1546 at the University of Naples, although this remains the nature
    of some controversy, as Ingrassia's description was published posthumously in
    his 1603 anatomical commentary In Galeni librum de ossibus doctissima et expectatissima
    commentaria. \n\nSpanish anatomist Pedro Jimeno is first to have been credited
    with a published description, in Dialogus de re medica (1549). \n\nThe bone is
    so-named because of its resemblance to a stirrup (Latin: stapes), an example
    of a late Latin word, probably created in mediaeval times from \"to stand\" (Latin:
    stapia), as stirrups did not exist in the early Latin-speaking world.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stapes"

  descriptionText: "\n\nPHALANX\n\n\nThe phalanx (Ancient Greek: \u03C6\u03AC\u03BB\u03B1\u03B3\u03BE;
    plural phalanxes or phalanges, \u03C6\u03AC\u03BB\u03B1\u03B3\u03B3\u03B5\u03C2,
    phalanges) was a rectangular mass military formation, usually composed entirely
    of heavy infantry armed with spears, pikes, sarissas, or similar pole weapons.
    \n\nThe term is particularly used to describe the use of this formation in Ancient
    Greek warfare, although the ancient Greek writers used it to also describe any
    massed infantry formation, regardless of its equipment. \n\nArrian uses the term
    in his Array against the Alans when he refers to his legions. \n\nIn Greek texts,
    the phalanx may be deployed for battle, on the march, or even camped, thus describing
    the mass of infantry or cavalry that would deploy in line during battle. \n\nThey
    marched forward as one entity. \nThe term itself, as used today, does not refer
    to a distinctive military unit or division (e.g., the Roman legion or the contemporary
    Western-type battalion), but to the type of formation of an army's troops. \n\nTherefore,
    this term does not indicate a standard combat strength or composition but includes
    the total number of infantry, which is deployed in a single formation known as
    a \"phalanx\".\nMany spear-armed troops historically fought in what might be
    termed phalanx-like formations. \n\nThis article focuses on the use of the military
    phalanx formation in Ancient Greece, the Hellenistic world, and other ancient
    states heavily influenced by Greek civilization.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe earliest
    known depiction of a phalanx-like formation occurs in a Sumerian stele from the
    25th century BC. \n\nHere the troops seem to have been equipped with spears,
    helmets, and large shields covering the whole body. \n\nAncient Egyptian infantry
    were known to have employed similar formations. \n\nThe first usage of the term
    phalanx comes from Homer's \"\u03C6\u03B1\u03BB\u03B1\u03B3\u03BE\", used to
    describe hoplites fighting in an organized battle line. \n\nHomer used the term
    to differentiate the formation-based combat from the individual duels so often
    found in his poems.Historians have not arrived at a consensus about the relationship
    between the Greek formation and these predecessors of the hoplites. \n\nThe principles
    of shield wall and spear hedge were almost universally known among the armies
    of major civilizations throughout history, and so the similarities may be related
    to convergent evolution instead of diffusion.\nTraditionally, historians date
    the origin of the hoplite phalanx of ancient Greece to the 8th century BC in
    Sparta, but this is under revision. \n\nIt is perhaps more likely that the formation
    was devised in the 7th century BC after the introduction of the aspis by the
    city of Argos, which would have made the formation possible. \n\nThis is further
    evidenced by the Chigi vase, dated to 650 BC, identifying hoplites armed with
    aspis, spear and panoply.Another possible theory as to the birth of Greek phalanx
    warfare stems from the idea that some of the basic aspects of the phalanx were
    present in earlier times yet were not fully developed due to the lack of appropriate
    technology. \n\nTwo of the basic tactics seen in earlier warfare include the
    principle of cohesion and the use of large groups of soldiers. \n\nThis would
    suggest that the Greek phalanx was rather the culmination and perfection of a
    slowly developed idea that originated many years earlier. \n\nAs weaponry and
    armour advanced through the years in different city-states, the phalanx became
    complex and effective.\n\n\n== Overview ==\n\nThe hoplite phalanx of the Archaic
    and Classical periods in Greece (c. 800\u2013350 BC) was the formation in which
    the hoplites would line up in ranks in close order. \n\nThe hoplites would lock
    their shields together, and the first few ranks of soldiers would project their
    spears out over the first rank of shields. \n\nThe phalanx therefore presented
    a shield wall and a mass of spear points to the enemy, making frontal assaults
    against it very difficult. \n\nIt also allowed a higher proportion of the soldiers
    to be actively engaged in combat at a given time (rather than just those in the
    front rank).\nBattles between two phalanxes usually took place in open, flat
    plains where it was easier to advance and stay in formation. \n\nRough terrain
    or hilly regions would have made it difficult to maintain a steady line and would
    have defeated the purpose of a phalanx. \n\nAs a result, battles between Greek
    city-states would not take place in just any location, nor would they be limited
    to sometimes obvious strategic points. \n\nRather, many times, the two opposing
    sides would find the most suitable piece of land where the conflict could be
    settled. \n\nTypically, the battle ended with one of the two fighting forces
    fleeing to safety.The phalanx usually advanced at a walking pace, although it
    is possible that they picked up speed during the last several yards. \n\nOne
    of the main reasons for this slow approach was to maintain formation. \n\nThe
    formation would be rendered useless if the phalanx was lost as the unit approached
    the enemy and could even become detrimental to the advancing unit, resulting
    in a weaker formation that was easier for an enemy force to break through. \n\nIf
    the hoplites of the phalanx were to pick up speed toward the latter part of the
    advance, it would have been for the purpose of gaining momentum against the enemy
    in the initial collision. \n\nHerodotus states of the Greeks at the Battle of
    Marathon, that \"They were the first Greeks we know of to charge their enemy
    at a run\". \n\nMany historians believe that this innovation was precipitated
    by their desire to minimize their losses from Persian archery. \n\nThe opposing
    sides would collide, possibly severing many of the spears of the row in front
    and killing the front part of the enemy army due to the bone-breaking collision.\nThe
    spears of a phalanx had spiked butts. \n\nIn battle, the back ranks used the
    spikes to finish fallen enemy soldiers.\n\n\n=== Pushing ===\n\nThe \"physical
    pushing match\" theory is one where the battle would rely on the valour of the
    men in the front line, whilst those in the rear maintained forward pressure on
    the front ranks with their shields, and the whole formation would consistently
    press forward trying to break the enemy formation. \n\nThis is the most widely
    accepted interpretation of the ancient sources thus when two phalanx formations
    engaged, the struggle essentially became a pushing match. \n\nHistorians such
    as Victor Davis Hanson point out that it is difficult to account for exceptionally
    deep phalanx formations unless they were necessary to facilitate the physical
    pushing depicted by this theory, as those behind the first two ranks could not
    take part in the actual spear thrusting.No Greek art ever depicts anything like
    a phalanx pushing match, so this hypothesis is a product of educated speculation
    rather than explicit testimony from contemporary sources and is far from being
    academically resolved. \n\nThe Greek term for \"push\" was used in the same metaphorical
    manner as the English word is (for example it was also used to describe the process
    of rhetorical arguments) and so does not necessarily describe a literal physical
    push, although it is possible that it did.\nFor instance, if Othismos were to
    accurately describe a physical pushing match, it would be logical to state that
    the deeper phalanx would always win an engagement since the physical strength
    of individuals would not compensate for even one additional rank on the enemy
    side. \n\nHowever, there are numerous examples of shallow phalanxes holding off
    an opponent. \n\nFor instance, at Delium in 424 BC, the Athenian left flank,
    a formation eight men deep, held off a formation of Thebans 25 deep without immediate
    collapse. \n\nIt is difficult with the physical pushing model to imagine eight
    men withstanding the pushing force of 25 opponents for a matter of seconds, let
    alone half the battle.\nSuch arguments have led to a wave of counter-criticism
    to physical shoving theorists. \n\nAdrian Goldsworthy, in his article \"The Othismos,
    Myths and Heresies: The nature of Hoplite Battle\", argues that the physical
    pushing match model does not fit with the average casualty figures of hoplite
    warfare nor the practical realities of moving large formations of men in battle.
    \n\nThis debate has yet to be resolved amongst scholars.\nPractical difficulties
    with this theory also include the fact that, in a shoving match, an eight-foot
    spear is too long to fight effectively or even parry attacks. \n\nSpears enable
    a formation of men to keep their enemies at a distance, parry attacks aimed at
    them and their comrades, and give the necessary reach to strike multiple men
    in the opposite formation. \n\nA pushing match would put enemies so close together
    that a quick stabbing with a knife would kill the front row almost instantly.
    \n\nThe crush of men would also prevent the formation from withdrawing or retreating,
    which would result in much higher casualties than is recorded. \n\nThe speed
    at which this would occur would also end the battle very quickly, instead of
    prolonging it for hours.\n\n\n=== Shields ===\n\nEach individual hoplite carried
    his shield on his left arm, protecting not only himself but also the soldier
    to the left. \n\nThis meant that the men at the extreme right of the phalanx
    were only half-protected. \n\nIn battle, opposing phalanxes would try to exploit
    this weakness by attempting to overlap the enemy's right flank. \n\nIt also meant
    that, in battle, a phalanx would tend to drift to the right (as hoplites sought
    to remain behind the shield of their neighbor). \n\nSome groups, such as the
    Spartans at Nemea, tried to use this phenomenon to their advantage. \n\nIn this
    case, the phalanx would sacrifice its left side, which typically consisted of
    allied troops, in an effort to overtake the enemy from the flank. \n\nIt is unlikely
    that this strategy worked very often, as it is not mentioned frequently in ancient
    Greek literature.There was a leader in each row of a phalanx, and a rear rank
    officer, the ouragos (meaning tail-leader), who kept order in the rear. \n\nThe
    hoplites had to trust their neighbors to protect them and in turn be willing
    to protect their neighbors; a phalanx was thus only as strong as its weakest
    elements. \n\nThe effectiveness of the phalanx therefore depended on how well
    the hoplites could maintain this formation in combat and how well they could
    stand their ground, especially when engaged against another phalanx. \n\nFor
    this reason, the formation was deliberately organized to group friends and family
    close together, thus providing a psychological incentive to support one's fellows,
    and a disincentive, through shame, to panic or attempt to flee. \n\nThe more
    disciplined and courageous the army, the more likely it was to win \u2013 often
    engagements between the various city-states of Greece would be resolved by one
    side fleeing before the battle. \n\nThe Greek word dynamis, the 'will to fight',
    expresses the drive that kept hoplites in formation.\n\nNow of those, who dare,
    abiding one beside another, to advance to the close fray, and the foremost champions,
    fewer die, and they save the people in the rear; but in men that fear, all excellence
    is lost. \n\nNo one could ever in words go through those several ills, which
    befall a man, if he has been actuated by cowardice. \n\nFor 'tis grievous to
    wound in the rear the back of a flying man in hostile war. \n\nShameful too is
    a corpse lying low in the dust, wounded behind in the back by the point of a
    spear.\n\n\n=== Hoplite armament ===\n\nEach hoplite provided his own equipment.
    \n\nThe primary hoplite weapon was a spear around 2.4 metres (7.9 ft) in length
    called a dory. \n\nAlthough accounts of its length vary, it is usually now believed
    to have been seven to nine feet long (~2.1\u20132.7 m). \n\nIt was held one-handed,
    with the other hand holding the hoplite's shield (aspis). \n\nThe spearhead was
    usually a curved leaf shape, while the rear of the spear had a spike called a
    sauroter ('lizard-killer') which was used to stand the spear in the ground (hence
    the name). \n\nIt was also used as a secondary weapon if the main shaft snapped
    or to kill enemies lying on the ground. \n\nThis was a common problem, especially
    for soldiers who were involved in the initial clash with the enemy. \n\nDespite
    the snapping of the spear, hoplites could easily switch to the sauroter without
    great consequence. \n\nThe rear ranks used the secondary end to finish off fallen
    opponents as the phalanx advanced over them.\nThroughout the hoplite era, the
    standard hoplite armour went through many cyclical changes. \n\nAn Archaic hoplite
    typically wore a bronze breastplate, a bronze helmet with cheekplates, as well
    as greaves and other armour. \n\nLater, in the classical period, the breastplate
    became less common, replaced instead with a corselet that some claim was made
    of linothorax (layers of linen glued together), or perhaps of leather, sometimes
    covered in whole or in part with overlapping metal scales. \n\nEventually, even
    greaves became less commonly used, although degrees of heavier armour remained,
    as attested by Xenophon as late as 401 BC.These changes reflected the balancing
    of mobility with protection, especially as cavalry became more prominent in the
    Peloponnesian War and the need to combat light troops, which were increasingly
    used to negate the hoplite's role as the primary force in battle. \n\nYet bronze
    armour remained in some form until the end of the hoplite era. \n\nSome archaeologists
    have pointed out that bronze armour does not actually provide as much protection
    from direct blows as more extensive corselet padding, and have suggested its
    continued use was a matter of status for those who could afford it. \n\nIn the
    classical Greek dialect, there is no word for swordsmen; yet hoplites also carried
    a short sword called the xiphos, used as a secondary weapon if the dory was broken
    or lost. \n\nSamples of the xiphos recovered at excavation sites were typically
    around 60 cm (24 in) in length. \n\nThese swords were double-edged and could
    therefore be used as a cutting and thrusting weapon. \n\nThese short swords were
    often used to stab or cut at the enemy's neck during close combat.Hoplites carried
    a circular shield called a hoplon (often referred to as an aspis) made from wood
    and covered in bronze, measuring roughly 1 metre (3.3 ft) in diameter. \n\nIt
    spanned from chin to knee and was very heavy (8\u201315 kg (18\u201333 lb)).
    \n\nThis medium-sized shield (fairly large for the period considering the average
    male height) was made possible partly by its dish-like shape, which allowed it
    to be supported with the rim on the shoulder. \n\nThis was quite an important
    feature of the shield, especially for the hoplites that remained in the latter
    ranks. \n\nWhile these soldiers continued to help press forward, they did not
    have the added burden of holding up their shield. \n\nBut the circular shield
    was not without its disadvantages. \n\nDespite its mobility, protective curve,
    and double straps the circular shape created gaps in the shield wall at both
    its top and bottom. (Top gaps were somewhat reduced by the one or two spears
    jutting out of the gap. \n\nIn order to minimize the bottom gaps, thick leather
    'curtains' were used but only by an [unknown] percentage of the hoplites, possibly
    mostly in the first row only since there were disadvantages as well: considerable
    added weight on an already heavy shield and a certain additional cost.) These
    gaps left parts of the hoplite exposed to potentially lethal spear thrusts and
    were a persistent vulnerability for hoplites controlling the front lines.\n\n\n===
    Phalangite armament ===\n\nThe phalanx of the Ancient Macedonian kingdom and
    the later Hellenistic successor states was a development of the hoplite phalanx.
    \n\nThe 'phalangites' were armed with a much longer spear, the sarissa, and less
    heavily armoured. \n\nThe sarissa was the pike used by the ancient Macedonian
    army. \n\nIts actual length is unknown, but apparently it was twice as long as
    the dory. \n\nThis makes it at least 14 feet (4.3 m), but 18 feet (5.5 m) appears
    more likely. (The cavalry xyston was 12.5 feet (3.8 m) by comparison.) The great
    length of the pike was balanced by a counterweight at the rear end, which also
    functioned as a butt-spike, allowing the sarissa to be planted into the ground.
    \n\nBecause of its great length, weight and different balance, a sarissa was
    wielded two-handed. \n\nThis meant that the aspis was no longer a practical defence.
    \n\nInstead, the phalangites strapped a smaller pelte shield (usually reserved
    for peltasts, light skirmishers) to their left forearm. \n\nRecent theories,
    including examination of ancient frescoes depicting full sets of weapons and
    armor, claim that the shields used were actually larger than the pelte but smaller
    than the aspis, hanging by leather strap(s) from the left shoulder or from both
    shoulders. \n\nThe shield would retain handling straps in the inner curve, to
    be handled like a (smaller) aspis if the fight progressed to sword-wielding.
    \n\nAlthough in both shield size assumptions this reduced the shield wall, the
    extreme length of the spear kept the enemy at a greater distance, as the pikes
    of the first three to five ranks could all be brought to bear in front of the
    front row. \n\nThis pike had to be held underhand, as the shield would have obscured
    the soldier's vision had it been held overhead. \n\nIt would also be very hard
    to remove a sarissa from anything it stuck in (the earth, shields, and soldiers
    of the opposition) if it were thrust downwards, due to its length. \n\nThe Macedonian
    phalanx was much less able to form a shield wall, but the lengthened spears would
    have compensated for this. \n\nSuch a phalanx formation also reduced the likelihood
    that battles would degenerate into a pushing match.\n\n\n== Deployment and combat
    ==\n\n=== Phalanx composition and strength ===\n\nThe basic combat element of
    the Greek armies was either the stichos (meaning 'file'; usually 8\u201316 men
    strong) or the enomotia (meaning 'sworn' and made up by 2\u20134 stich\u0153,
    totaling up to 32 men), both led by a dim\u0153rites who was assisted by a decadarchos
    and two decaster\u0153 (sing. decasteros). \n\nFour to a maximum of 32 enomoti\xE6
    (depending on the era in question or the city) were forming a lochos led by a
    lochagos, who in this way was in command of initially 100 hoplites to a maximum
    of c. 500 in the late Hellenistic armies. \n\nHere, it has to be noted that the
    military manuals of Asclepiodotus and Aelian use the term lochos to denote a
    file in the phalanx. \n\nA taxis (mora for the Spartans) was the greatest standard
    hoplitic formation of 500 to 1500 men, led by a strategos (general). \n\nThe
    entire army, a total of several taxeis or mor\xE6 was led by a generals' council.
    \n\nThe commander-in-chief was usually called a polemarchos or a strategos autocrator.\n\n\n===
    Phalanx front and depth ===\n\nHoplite phalanxes usually deployed in ranks of
    eight men or more deep; the Macedonian phalanxes were usually 16 men deep, sometimes
    reported to have been arrayed 32 men deep. \n\nThere are some notable extremes;
    at the battles of Leuctra and Mantinea, the Theban general Epaminondas arranged
    the left wing of the phalanx into a \"hammerhead\" of 50 ranks of elite hoplites
    deep (see below) and when depth was less important, phalanxes just four deep
    are recorded, as at the battle of Marathon.The phalanx depth could vary depending
    on the needs of the moment and plans of the general. \n\nWhile the phalanx was
    in march, an eis bathos formation (loose, meaning literally 'in depth') was adopted
    in order to move more freely and maintain order. \n\nThis was also the initial
    battle formation as, in addition, it permitted friendly units to pass through
    whether assaulting or retreating. \n\nIn this status, the phalanx had twice the
    normal depth and each hoplite had to occupy about 1.8\u20132 metres (5 ft 11
    in\u20136 ft 7 in) in width. \n\nWhen enemy infantry was approaching, a rapid
    switch to the pycne (spelled also pucne) formation (dense or tight formation)
    was necessary. \n\nIn that case, each man's space was halved (0.9\u20131 metre
    or 2 feet 11 inches\u20133 feet 3 inches in width) and the formation depth returned
    to normal. \n\nAn even denser formation, the synaspismos or sunaspismos (ultra-tight
    or locked shields formation), was used when the phalanx was expected to experience
    extra pressure, intense missile volleys or frontal cavalry charges. \n\nIn synaspismos,
    the rank depth was half that of a normal phalanx and the width each man occupied
    was as small as 0.45 metres (1.5 ft).\n\n\n=== Stages of combat ===\n\nSeveral
    stages in hoplite combat can be defined:\nEphodos: The hoplites stop singing
    their p\xE6anes (battle hymns) and move towards the enemy, gradually picking
    up pace and momentum. \n\nIn the instants before impact, war cries (alalagm\u0153,
    sing. alalagmos) would be made. \n\nNotable war cries were the Athenian (eleleleleu!
    eleleleleu!) and the Macedonian (alalalalai! alalalalai!) alalagm\u0153.\nKrousis:
    The opposing phalanxes meet each other almost simultaneously along their front.
    \nDoratismos: Repeated, rapid spear thrusts in order to disrupt the enemy formation.
    \n\nThe use of long spears would keep enemies apart as well as allow men in a
    row to assist their comrades next to them. \n\nThe prodding could also open up
    a man to allow a comrade to spear him. \n\nToo hard prodding could get a spear
    stuck in a shield, which would necessitate someone in the back to lend his to
    the now-disarmed man.\nOthismos: Literally 'pushing' after most spears have been
    broken, the hoplites begin to push with their spears and spear shafts against
    their opponents' shields. \n\nThis could be the longest phase.Pararrhexis: 'Breaching'
    the opposing phalanx, the enemy formation shatters and the battle ends. \n\nCavalry
    would be used at this point to mop up the scattered enemy.\n\n\n== Tactics ==\n\nThe
    early history of the phalanx is largely one of combat between hoplite armies
    from competing Greek city-states. \n\nThe usual result was rather identical,
    inflexible formations pushing against each other until one broke. \n\nThe potential
    of the phalanx to achieve something more was demonstrated at Battle of Marathon
    (490 BC). \n\nFacing the much larger army of Darius I, the Athenians thinned
    out their phalanx and consequently lengthened their front, to avoid being outflanked.
    \n\nHowever, even a reduced-depth phalanx proved unstoppable to the lightly armed
    Persian infantry. \n\nAfter routing the Persian wings, the hoplites on the Athenian
    wings wheeled inwards, destroying the elite troop at the Persian centre, resulting
    in a crushing victory for Athens. \n\nThroughout the Greco-Persian Wars the hoplite
    phalanx was to prove superior to the Persian infantry (e.g. the battles of Thermopylae
    and Plataea).\nPerhaps the most prominent example of the phalanx's evolution
    was the oblique order, made famous in the Battle of Leuctra. \n\nThere, the Theban
    general Epaminondas thinned out the right flank and centre of his phalanx, and
    deepened his left flank to an unheard-of 50 men deep. \n\nIn doing so, Epaminondas
    reversed the convention by which the right flank of the phalanx was strongest.
    \n\nThis allowed the Thebans to assault in strength the elite Spartan troops
    on the right flank of the opposing phalanx. \n\nMeanwhile, the centre and right
    flank of the Theban line were echeloned back, from the opposing phalanx, keeping
    the weakened parts of the formation from being engaged. \n\nOnce the Spartan
    right had been routed by the Theban left, the remainder of the Spartan line also
    broke. \n\nThus, by localising the attacking power of the hoplites, Epaminondas
    was able to defeat an enemy previously thought invincible.\nPhilip II of Macedon
    spent several years in Thebes as a hostage, and paid attention to Epaminondas'
    innovations. \n\nOn return to his homeland, he raised a revolutionary new infantry
    force, which was to change the face of the Greek world. \n\nPhilip's phalangites
    were the first force of professional soldiers seen in Ancient Greece apart from
    Sparta. \n\nThey were armed with longer spears (the sarissa) and were drilled
    more thoroughly in more evolved, complicated tactics and manoeuvres. \n\nMore
    importantly, though, Philip's phalanx was part of a multi-faceted, combined force
    that included a variety of skirmishers and cavalry, most notably the famous Companion
    cavalry. \n\nThe Macedonian phalanx now was used to pin the centre of the enemy
    line, while cavalry and more mobile infantry struck at the foe's flanks. \n\nIts
    supremacy over the more static armies fielded by the Greek city-states was shown
    at the Battle of Chaeronea, where Philip II's army crushed the allied Theban
    and Athenian phalanxes.\n\n\n== Weaknesses ==\n\nThe hoplite phalanx was weakest
    when facing an enemy fielding lighter and more flexible troops without its own
    such supporting troops. \n\nAn example of this would be the Battle of Lechaeum,
    where an Athenian contingent led by Iphicrates routed an entire Spartan mora
    (a unit of anywhere from 500 to 900 hoplites). \n\nThe Athenian force had a considerable
    proportion of light missile troops armed with javelins and bows that wore down
    the Spartans with repeated attacks, causing disarray in the Spartan ranks and
    an eventual rout when they spotted Athenian heavy infantry reinforcements trying
    to flank them by boat.\nThe Macedonian phalanx had weaknesses similar to its
    hoplitic predecessor. \n\nTheoretically indestructible from the front, its flanks
    and rear were very vulnerable, and once engaged it may not easily disengage or
    redeploy to face a threat from those directions. \n\nThus, a phalanx facing non-phalangite
    formations required some sort of protection on its flanks\u2014lighter or at
    least more mobile infantry, cavalry, etc. \n\nThis was shown at the Battle of
    Magnesia, where, once the Seleucid supporting cavalry elements were driven off,
    the phalanx was static and unable to go on the offensive against its Roman opponents
    (although they continued to resist stoutly and attempted a fighting withdrawal
    under a hail of Roman missiles, until the elephants posted on their flanks panicked
    and disrupted their formation).\nThe Macedonian phalanx could also lose its cohesion
    without proper coordination or while moving through broken terrain; doing so
    could create gaps between individual blocks/syntagmata, or could prevent a solid
    front within those sub-units as well, causing other sections of the line to bunch
    up. \n\nIn this event, as in the battles of Cynoscephalae and Pydna, the phalanx
    became vulnerable to attacks by more flexible units\u2014such as Roman legionary
    centuries, which were able to avoid the sarissae and engage in hand-to-hand combat
    with the phalangites.\nAnother important area that must be considered concerns
    the psychological tendencies of the hoplites. \n\nBecause the strength of a phalanx
    depended on the ability of the hoplites to maintain their frontline, it was crucial
    that a phalanx be able to quickly and efficiently replace fallen soldiers in
    the front ranks. \n\nIf a phalanx failed to do this in a structured manner, the
    opposing phalanx would have an opportunity to breach the line which, many times,
    would lead to a quick defeat. \n\nThis then implies that the hoplites ranks closer
    to the front must be mentally prepared to replace their fallen comrade and adapt
    to his new position without disrupting the structure of the frontline.Finally,
    most of the phalanx-centric armies tended to lack supporting echelons behind
    the main line of battle. \n\nThis meant that breaking through the line of battle
    or compromising one of its flanks often ensured victory.\n\n\n== Classical decline
    and post-classical use ==\n\nAfter reaching its zenith in the conquests of Alexander
    the Great, the phalanx began a slow decline, as Macedonian successor states declined.
    \n\nThe combined arms tactics used by Alexander and his father were gradually
    replaced by a return to the simpler frontal charge tactics of the hoplite phalanx.
    \n\nThe expense of the supporting arms and cavalry, and the widespread use of
    mercenaries, caused the Diadochi to rely on phalanx vs. phalanx tactics during
    the Wars of the Diadochi.\nThe decline of the Diadochi and the phalanx was linked
    with the rise of Rome and the Roman legions from the 3rd century BC. \n\nThe
    Battle of the Caudine Forks showed the clumsiness of the Roman phalanx against
    the Samnites. \n\nThe Romans had originally employed the phalanx themselves but
    gradually evolved more flexible tactics. \n\nThe result was the three-line Roman
    legion of the middle period of the Roman Republic, the Manipular System. \n\nRomans
    used a phalanx for their third military line, the triarii. \n\nThese were veteran
    reserve troops armed with the hastae or spear. \n\nRome conquered most of the
    Macedonian successor states. \n\nAlso the various Greek city-states and leagues.
    \n\nAs these states ceased to exist, so did the armies which used the traditional
    phalanx. \n\nSubsequently, troops from these regions were equipped, trained and
    fought using the Roman model.\nA phalanx formation called the phoulkon appeared
    in the late Roman army and Byzantine army. \n\nIt had characteristics of the
    classical Greek and Hellenistic phalanxes, but was more flexible. \n\nIt was
    used against cavalry more than infantry.\nHowever, the phalanx did not totally
    disappear. \n\nIn some battles between the Roman army and Hellenistic phalanxes,
    such as Pydna (168 BC), Cynoscephalae (197 BC) and Magnesia (190 BC), the phalanx
    performed well. \n\nIt even drove back the Roman infantry. \n\nHowever, at Cynoscephalae
    and Magnesia, failure to defend the flanks of the phalanx led to defeat. \n\nAt
    Pydna, the phalanx lost cohesion when pursuing retreating Roman soldiers. \n\nThis
    allowed the Romans to penetrate the formation. \n\nThen, Roman close combat skills
    proved decisive. \n\nThe historian Polybius details the effectiveness of the
    Roman legion against the phalanx. \n\nHe deduces that the Romans refused to fight
    the phalanx where the phalanx was effective, Romans offered battle only when
    a legion could exploit the clumsiness and immobility of a phalanx.\n\nSpear-armed
    troops continued to be important elements in many armies until reliable firearms
    became available. \n\nThese did not necessarily fight as a phalanx. \n\nFor example,
    compare the classical phalanx and late medieval pike formations.Military historians
    have suggested that the Scots under William Wallace and Robert the Bruce consciously
    imitated the Hellenistic phalanx to produce the Scots 'hedgehog' or schiltron.
    \n\nHowever, long spears might have been used by Picts and others in Scotlands'
    Early Middle Ages. \n\nPrior to 1066, long spear tactics (also found in North
    Wales) might have been part of irregular warfare in Britain. \n\nThe Scots used
    imported French pikes and dynamic tactics at the Battle of Flodden. \n\nHowever,
    Flodden found the Scots pitted against effective light artillery, while advancing
    over bad ground. \n\nThe combination disorganised the Scotts phalanxes and permitted
    effective attacks by English longbowmen, and soldiers wielding shorter, handier
    polearms called bills. \n\nSome contemporary sources might say that the bills
    cut off the heads of Scots pikes.\nThe pike was briefly reconsidered as a weapon
    by European armies in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. \n\nIt could protect
    riflemen, whose slower rate of fire made them vulnerable. \n\nA collapsible pike
    was invented but never issued. \n\nThe Confederate Army considered these for
    the American Civil War. \n\nSome were even manufactured but probably were never
    issued. \n\nPikes were manufactured during World War II as \"Croft's Pikes\".\nWhile
    obsolete in military practice, the phalanx remained in use as a metaphor of warriors
    moving forward as a single united block. \n\nThis metaphor inspired several 20th-century
    political movements, notably the Spanish Falange and its ideology of Falangism.\nThe
    Byzantines continued and improved the use of the classical Greek phalanx alongside
    the Macedonian-style phalanx. \n\nThe latter was based on a model that Alexander
    himself had created and had tried to give more importance to the skirmishers
    and cavalry, yet it never saw action until the Byzantines adopted the model that
    rely in a mixture of many units sometimes. \n\nMany writers of the age describe
    the spear as being a sarissa yet it was a meter short than the original sarissa
    and had being modified by the time, yet the term for the long spear remained
    alongside with its other names.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phalanx"

    its distal and medial surface with the hamate bone.:\u200A708\u200AThe lunate
    is stabilised by a medial ligament to the scaphoid and a lateral ligament to
    the triquetrum. \n\nLigaments between the radius and carpal bone also stabilise
    the position of the lunate, as does its position in the lunate fossa of the radius.\n\n\n===
    Bone ===\n\nThe proximal surface of the lunate bone is smooth and convex, articulating
    with the radius. \n\nThe lateral surface is flat and narrow, with a crescentic
    facet for articulation with the scaphoid. \n\nThe medial surface possesses a
    smooth and quadrilateral facet for articulation with the triquetral. \n\nThe
    palmar surface is rough, as is the dorsal surface. \n\nThe dorsal surface is
    broad and rounded. \n\nThe distal surface of the bone is deep and concave.\n\n\n===
    Blood supply ===\n\nThe lunate receives its blood supply from dorsal and palmar
    branches.\n\n\n=== Variation ===\n\nThe lunate has a variable shape. \n\nAbout
    one-third of lunate bones do not possess a medial facet, meaning they do not
    articulate with the hamate bone. \n\nAdditionally, in about 20% of people, blood
    supply may arise from palmar vessels alone.\n\n\n=== Ossification ===\n\nThe
    ossification of the lunate bone commences between 18 months and 4 years and 3
    months.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\nThe carpal bones function as a unit to provide
    a bony superstructure for the hand.:\u200A708\u200A As a proximal carpal bone,
    the lunate is also involved in movement of the wrist.\n\n\n== Clinical relevance
    ==\n\n\nThe lunate bone is the most frequently dislocated carpal bone. \n\nCarpal
    coalition\nKienbock's disease\nTeisen classification\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe
    name of the lunate bone derives from the \"crescent-shaped\" (Latin: lunatus),
    from Latin luna (\"moon\"), from the bone's resemblance to a crescent moon. \n\nIn
    amphibians and reptiles, the bone is instead referred to as the intermedium,
    because of its position between the other two proximal carpals.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunate_bone"

  descriptionText: "\n\nFIRST RIB\n\n\n== Structure of the rib cage ==\n\nRibs are
    described based on their location and connection with the sternum. \n\nAll ribs
    are attached posteriorly to the thoracic vertebrae and are numbered accordingly
    one to twelve. \n\nRibs that articulate directly with the sternum are called
    true ribs, whereas those that do not articulate directly are termed false ribs.
    \n\n\n=== Attachment of the rib cage ===\n\nThe terms true ribs and false ribs
    describe rib pairs that are directly or indirectly attached to the sternum. \n\nThe
    first seven rib pairs known as the fixed or vertebrosternal ribs are the true
    ribs (Latin: costae verae) as they connect directly to the sternum; the next
    five pairs (eighth to twelfth) are the false ribs (Latin: costae spuriae). \n\n\n===
    Parts of rib (general) ===\n\nEach rib consists of a head, neck, and a shaft.
    \n\nAll ribs are attached posteriorly to the thoracic vertebrae. \n\nThey are
    numbered to match the vertebrae they attach to \u2013 one to twelve, from top
    (T1) to bottom. \n\nThe head of the rib is the end part closest to the vertebra
    with which it articulates. \n\nIt is marked by a kidney-shaped articular surface
    which is divided by a horizontal crest into two articulating regions. \n\nThe
    upper region articulates with the inferior costal facet on the vertebra above,
    and the larger region articulates with the superior costal facet on the vertebra
    with the same number. \n\nThe transverse process of a thoracic vertebra also
    articulates at the transverse costal facet with the tubercle of the rib of the
    same number. \n\nThe crest gives attachment to the intra-articular ligament.The
    neck of the rib is the flattened part that extends laterally from the head. \n\nThe
    neck is about 3 cm long. \n\nIts anterior surface is flat and smooth, whilst
    its posterior is perforated by numerous foramina and its surface rough, to give
    attachment to the ligament of the neck. \n\nIts upper border presents a rough
    crest (crista colli costae) for the attachment of the anterior costotransverse
    ligament; its lower border is rounded.\n\nOn the posterior surface at the neck,
    is an eminence\u2014the tubercle that consists of an articular and a non-articular
    portion. \n\nThe articular portion is the lower and more medial of the two and
    presents a small, oval surface for articulation with the transverse costal facet
    on the end of the transverse process of the lower of the two vertebrae to which
    the head is connected. \n\nThe non-articular portion is a rough elevation and
    affords attachment to the ligament of the tubercle. \n\nThe tubercle is much
    more prominent in the upper ribs than in the lower ribs.\n\nThe angle of a rib
    (costal angle) may both refer to the bending part of it, and a prominent line
    in this area, a little in front of the tubercle. \n\nThis line is directed downward
    and laterally; this gives attachment to a tendon of the iliocostalis muscle.
    \n\nAt this point, the rib is bent in two directions, and at the same time twisted
    on its long axis.\n\nThe distance between the angle and the tubercle is progressively
    greater from the second to the tenth ribs. \n\nThe area between the angle and
    the tubercle is rounded, rough, and irregular, and serves for the attachment
    of the longissimus dorsi muscle.\n\n\n==== Ribs and vertebrae ====\n\nThe first
    rib (the topmost one) is the most curved and usually the shortest of all the
    ribs; it is broad and flat, its surfaces looking upward and downward, and its
    borders inward and outward.\n        \nThe head is small and rounded, and possesses
    only a single articular facet, for articulation with the body of the first thoracic
    vertebra. \n\nThe neck is narrow and rounded. \n\nThe tubercle, thick and prominent,
    is placed on the outer border. \n\nIt bears a small facet for articulation with
    the transverse costal facet on the transverse process of T1. \n\nThere is no
    angle, but at the tubercle, the rib is slightly bent, with the convexity upward,
    so that the head of the bone is directed downward. \n\nThe upper surface of the
    body is marked by two shallow grooves, separated from each other by a slight
    ridge prolonged internally into a tubercle, the scalene tubercle, for the attachment
    of the anterior scalene; the anterior groove transmits the subclavian vein, the
    posterior the subclavian artery and the lowest trunk of the brachial plexus.
    \n\nBehind the posterior groove is a rough area for the attachment of the medial
    scalene. \n\nThe under surface is smooth and without a costal groove. \n\nThe
    outer border is convex, thick, and rounded, and at its posterior part gives attachment
    to the first digitation of the serratus anterior. \n\nThe inner border is concave,
    thin, and sharp, and marked about its center by the scalene tubercle. \n\nThe
    anterior extremity is larger and thicker than that of any of the other ribs.\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rib_cage"

  descriptionText: "\n\nLUMBAR VERTEBRAE\n\n\nThe lumbar vertebrae are, in human
    anatomy, the five vertebrae between the rib cage and the pelvis. \n\nThey are
    the largest segments of the vertebral column and are characterized by the absence
    of the foramen transversarium within the transverse process (since it is only
    found in the cervical region) and by the absence of facets on the sides of the
    body (as found only in the thoracic region). \n\nThey are designated L1 to L5,
    starting at the top. \n\nThe lumbar vertebrae help support the weight of the
    body, and permit movement.\n\n\n== Human anatomy ==\n\n=== General characteristics
    ===\n\nThe figure on the left depicts the general characteristics of the first
    through fourth lumbar vertebrae. \n\nThe fifth vertebra contains certain peculiarities,
    which are detailed below.\n\nAs with other vertebrae, each lumbar vertebra consists
    of a vertebral body and a vertebral arch. \n\nThe vertebral arch, consisting
    of a pair of pedicles and a pair of laminae, encloses the vertebral foramen (opening)
    and supports seven processes.\n\n\n==== Body ====\n\nThe vertebral body of each
    lumbar vertebra is kidney shaped, wider from side to side than from front to
    back, and a little thicker in front than in back. \n\nIt is flattened or slightly
    concave above and below, concave behind, and deeply constricted in front and
    at the sides.\n\n\n==== Arch ====\n\nThe pedicles are very strong, directed backward
    from the upper part of the vertebral body; consequently, the inferior vertebral
    notches are of considerable depth. \n\nThe pedicles change in morphology from
    the upper lumbar to the lower lumbar. \n\nThey increase in sagittal width from
    9 mm to up to 18 mm at L5. \n\nThey increase in angulation in the axial plane
    from 10 degrees to 20 degrees by L5. \n\nThe pedicle is sometimes used as a portal
    of entrance into the vertebral body for fixation with pedicle screws or for placement
    of bone cement as with kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty.\n\nThe laminae are broad,
    short, and strong. \n\nThey form the posterior portion of the vertebral arch.
    \n\nIn the upper lumbar region the lamina are taller than wide but in the lower
    lumbar vertebra the lamina are wider than tall. \n\nThe lamina connects the spinous
    process to the pedicles.\nThe vertebral foramen within the arch is triangular,
    larger than the thoracic vertebrae, but smaller than in the cervical vertebrae.\n\n\n====
    Processes ====\n\nThe spinous process is thick, broad, and somewhat quadrilateral;
    it projects backward and ends in a rough, uneven border, thickest below where
    it is occasionally notched.The superior and inferior articular processes are
    well-defined, projecting respectively upward and downward from the junctions
    of pedicles and laminae. \n\nThe facets on the superior processes are concave,
    and look backward and medialward; those on the inferior are convex, and are directed
    forward and lateralward. \n\nThe former are wider apart than the latter since
    in the articulated column, the inferior articular processes are embraced by the
    superior processes of the subjacent vertebra.The transverse processes are long
    and slender. \n\nThey are horizontal in the upper three lumbar vertebrae and
    incline a little upward in the lower two. \n\nIn the upper three vertebrae they
    arise from the junctions of the pedicles and laminae, but in the lower two they
    are set farther forward and spring from the pedicles and posterior parts of the
    vertebral bodies. \n\nThey are situated in front of the articular processes instead
    of behind them as in the thoracic vertebrae, and are homologous with the ribs.\n\nThree
    portions or tubercles can be noticed in a transverse process of a lower lumbar
    vertebrae: the lateral or costiform process, the mammillary process, and the
    accessory process. \n\nThe costiform is lateral, the mammillary is superior (cranial),
    and the accessory is inferior (caudal). \n\nThe mammillary is connected in the
    lumbar region with the back part of the superior articular process. \n\nThe accessory
    process is situated at the back part of the base of the transverse process. \n\nThe
    tallest and thickest costiform process is usually that of L5.\n\n\n=== First
    and fifth lumbar vertebrae ===\n\n\nThe first lumbar vertebra is level with the
    anterior end of the ninth rib. \n\nThis level is also called the important transpyloric
    plane, since the pylorus of the stomach is at this level. \n\nOther important
    structures are also located at this level, they include; fundus of the gall bladder,
    celiac trunk, superior mesenteric artery, termination of spinal cord, beginning
    of filum terminalis, renal vessels, middle suprarenal arteries, and hila of kidneys.\n\nThe
    fifth lumbar vertebra is characterized by its body being much deeper in front
    than behind, which accords with the prominence of the sacrovertebral articulation;
    by the smaller size of its spinous process; by the wide interval between the
    inferior articular processes, and by the thickness of its transverse processes,
    which spring from the body as well as from the pedicles.\n\nThe fifth lumbar
    vertebra is by far the most common site of spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis.Most
    individuals have five lumbar vertebrae, while some have four or six. \n\nLumbar
    disorders that normally affect L5 will affect L4 or L6 in these latter individuals.\n\n\n===
    Segmental movements ===\n\nThe range of segmental movements in a single segment
    is difficult to measure clinically, not only because of variations between individuals,
    but also because it is age and sex dependent. \n\nFurthermore, flexion and extension
    in the lumbal spine is the product of a combination of rotation and translation
    in the sagittal plane between each vertebra.Ranges of segmental movements in
    the lumbar spine (White and Punjabi, 1990) are (in degrees):\n\n\n=== Congenital
    anomalies ===\n\nCongenital vertebral anomalies can cause compression of the
    spinal cord by deforming the vertebral canal or causing instability.\n\n\n==
    Other animals ==\n\nAfrican apes have three and four lumbar vertebrae, (bonobos
    have longer spines with an additional vertebra) and humans normally five. \n\nThis
    difference, and because the lumbar spines of the extinct Nacholapithecus (a Miocene
    hominoid with six lumbar vertebrae and no tail) are similar to those of early
    Australopithecus and early Homo, it is assumed that the Chimpanzee-human last
    common ancestor also had a long vertebral column with a long lumbar region and
    that the reduction in the number of lumbar vertebrae evolved independently in
    each ape clade.\n\nThe limited number of lumbar vertebrae in chimpanzees and
    gorillas result in an inability to lordose (curve) their lumbar spines, in contrast
    to the spines of Old World monkeys and Nacholapithecus and Proconsul, which suggests
    that the last common ancestor was not \"short-backed\" as previously believed.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumbar_vertebrae"

  descriptionText: "\n\nCUBOID BONE\n\n\nIn the human body, the cuboid bone is one
    of the seven tarsal bones of the foot.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe cuboid bone
    is the most lateral of the bones in the distal row of the tarsus. \n\nIt is roughly
    cubical in shape, and presents a prominence in its inferior (or plantar) surface,
    the tuberosity of the cuboid. \n\nThe bone provides a groove where the tendon
    of the peroneus longus muscle passes to reach its insertion in the first metatarsal
    and medial cuneiform bones.\n\n\n=== Surfaces ===\n\nThe dorsal surface, directed
    upward and lateralward, is rough, for the attachment of ligaments.\n\nThe plantar
    surface presents in front a deep groove, the peroneal sulcus, which runs obliquely
    forward and medialward; it lodges the tendon of the peroneus longus, and is bounded
    behind by a prominent ridge, to which the long plantar ligament is attached.\n\nThe
    ridge ends laterally in an eminence, the tuberosity, the surface of which presents
    an oval facet; on this facet glides the sesamoid bone or cartilage frequently
    found in the tendon of the peroneus longus. \n\nThe surface of bone behind the
    groove is rough, for the attachment of the plantar calcaneocuboid ligament, a
    few fibers of the flexor hallucis brevis, and a fasciculus from the tendon of
    the tibialis posterior.\n\nThe lateral surface presents a deep notch formed by
    the commencement of the peroneal sulcus.\n\nThe posterior surface is smooth,
    triangular, and concavo-convex, for articulation with the anterior surface of
    the calcaneus (the calcaneocuboid joint); its infero-medial angle projects backward
    as a process which underlies and supports the anterior end of the calcaneus.\n\nThe
    anterior surface, of smaller size, but also irregularly triangular, is divided
    by a vertical ridge into two facets, forming the fourth and fifth tarsometatarsal
    joints: the medial facet, quadrilateral in form, articulates with the fourth
    metatarsal; the lateral, larger and more triangular, articulates with the fifth.\n\nThe
    medial surface is broad, irregularly quadrilateral, and presents at its middle
    and upper part a smooth oval facet, for articulation with the third cuneiform;
    and behind this (occasionally) a smaller facet, for articulation with the navicular
    bone; it is rough in the rest of its extent, for the attachment of strong interosseous
    ligaments.\n\n\n=== Muscle attachments ===\n\nOnly one muscle is attached to
    the cuboid bone; the tibialis posterior. \n\nThe tibialis posterior inserts to
    the under surface of the cuboid bone. \n\nWhile the flexor hallucis brevis arises,
    by a pointed tendinous process, from the medial part of the under surface of
    the cuboid bone, from the contiguous portion of the lateral cuneiform bone, and
    from the prolongation of the tendon of the tibialis posterior.\n\n\n== Clinical
    significance ==\n\nIn a condition known as cuboid syndrome, the cuboid can be
    subluxated downward causing a swollen kind of ache along the central portion
    of the lateral border of the foot.\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuboid_bone"

  descriptionText: "\n\nTRAPEZIUM BONE\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe trapezium is distinguished
    by a deep groove on its anterior surface. \n\nIt is situated at the radial side
    of the carpus, between the scaphoid and the first metacarpal bone (the metacarpal
    bone of the thumb). \n\nIt is homologous with the first distal carpal of reptiles
    and amphibians.\n\n\n=== Surfaces ===\n\nThe trapezium is an irregular-shaped
    carpal bone found within the hand. \n\nThe trapezium is found within the distal
    row of carpal bones, and is directly adjacent to the metacarpal bone of the thumb.
    \n\nOn its ulnar surface are found the trapezoid and scaphoid bones.\n\nThe superior
    surface is directed upward and medialward; medially it is smooth, and articulates
    with the scaphoid; laterally it is rough and continuous with the lateral surface.\n\nThe
    inferior surface is oval, concave from side to side, convex from before backward,
    so as to form a saddle-shaped surface for articulation with the base of the first
    metacarpal bone. \n\nThis saddle-shaped articulation is partially responsible
    for the thumb's opposable motion.\n\nThe dorsal surface is smooth.\nThe palmar
    surface is narrow and rough. \n\nAt its upper part is a deep groove, running
    from above obliquely downward and medialward; it transmits the tendon of the
    Flexor carpi radialis, and is bounded laterally by an oblique ridge. \n\nThis
    surface gives origin to the Opponens pollicis and to the Abductor and Flexor
    pollicis brevis; it also affords attachment to the transverse carpal ligament.\n\nThe
    lateral surface is broad and rough, for the attachment of ligaments.\n\nThe medial
    surface presents two facets; the upper, large and concave, articulates with the
    trapezoid bone; the lower, small and oval, with the base of the second metacarpal.\n\n\n===
    Tubercle of trapezium ===\n\nThe tubercle of trapezium is a tubercle found on
    the anterior surface of the bone. \n\nIt is where sometimes abductor pollicis
    brevis muscle attaches.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\nThe carpal bones function as a
    unit to provide a bony superstructure for the hand. \n\nThe trapezium is the
    most radial of the bones surrounding the carpal tunnel.\n\nIt is important in
    thumb movement.\n\n\n== Clinical relevance ==\n\nThe trapezium is susceptible
    to arthritis at the joint with the metacarpal bone of the thumb, due to overuse.\n\n\n==
    History ==\n\nThe etymology derives from the Greek trapezion which means \"a
    little table\", from trapeza meaning \"table\", itself from (te)tra- \"four\"
    and pod- \"foot\". \n\nThe bone was first documented in 1840.\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapezium_(bone)"

  descriptionText: "\n\nSCAPHOID BONE\n\n\nThe scaphoid bone is one of the carpal
    bones of the wrist. \n\nIt is situated between the hand and forearm on the thumb
    side of the wrist (also called the lateral or radial side). \n\nIt forms the
    radial border of the carpal tunnel. \n\nThe scaphoid bone is the largest bone
    of the proximal row of wrist bones, its long axis being from above downward,
    lateralward, and forward. \n\nIt is approximately the size and shape of a medium
    cashew.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe scaphoid is situated between the proximal
    and distal rows of carpal bones. \n\nIt is located on the radial side of the
    wrist, and articulates with the radius, lunate, trapezoid, trapezium and capitate.:\u200A176\u200A
    Over 80% of the bone is covered in articular cartilage.\n\n\n=== Bone ===\n\nThe
    palmar surface of the scaphoid is concave, and forming a tubercle, giving attachment
    to the transverse carpal ligament. \n\nThe proximal surface is triangular, smooth
    and convex, and articulates with the radius and adjacent carpal bones, namely
    the lunate, capitate, trapezium and trapezoid. \n\nThe lateral surface is narrow
    and gives attachment to the radial collateral ligament. \n\nThe medial surface
    has two facets, a flattened semi-lunar facet articulating with the lunate bone,
    and an inferior concave facet, articulating alongside the lunate with the head
    of the capitate bone.The dorsal surface of the bone is narrow, with a groove
    running the length of the bone and allowing ligaments to attach, and the surface
    facing the fingers (anatomically inferior) is smooth and convex, also triangular,
    and divided into two parts by a slight ridge.\n\n\n=== Blood supply ===\n\nIt
    receives its blood supply primarily from lateral and distal branches of the radial
    artery, via palmar and dorsal branches. \n\nThese provide an \"abundant\" supply
    to middle and distal portions of the bone, but neglect the proximal portion,
    which relies on retrograde flow.:\u200A189\u200A The dorsal branch supplies the
    majority of the middle and distal portions, with the palmar branch supplying
    only the distal third of the bone.\n\n\n=== Variation ===\n\nThe dorsal blood
    supply, particularly of the proximal portion, is highly variable.:\u200A189\u200A
    Sometimes the fibers of the abductor pollicis brevis emerge from the tubercle.\n\n\n===
    In animals ===\n\nIn reptiles, birds, and amphibians, this bone is instead commonly
    referred to as the radiale because of its articulation with the radius.\n\n\n==
    Function ==\n\nThe carpal bones function as a unit to provide a bony superstructure
    for the hand.:\u200A708\u200A The scaphoid is also involved in movement of the
    wrist.:\u200A6\u200A It, along with the lunate, articulates with the radius and
    ulna to form the major bones involved in movement of the wrist. \n\nThe scaphoid
    serves as a link between the two rows of carpal bones. \n\nWith wrist movement,
    the scaphoid may flex from its position in the same plane as the forearm to perpendicular.:\u200A176\u2013177\u200A\n\n\n==
    Clinical significance ==\n\n\n\n=== Fracture ===\n\n\nFractures of the scaphoid
    are the most common of the carpal bone injuries, because of its connections with
    the two rows of carpal bones.:\u200A177\u200AThe scaphoid can be slow to heal
    because of the limited circulation to the bone. \n\nFractures of the scaphoid
    must be recognized and treated quickly, as prompt treatment by immobilization
    or surgical fixation increases the likelihood of the bone healing in anatomic
    alignment, thus avoiding mal-union or non-union. \n\nDelays may compromise healing.
    \n\nFailure of the fracture to heal (\"non-union\") will lead to post-traumatic
    osteoarthritis of the carpus.:\u200A189\u200A One reason for this is because
    of the \"tenuous\" blood supply to the proximal segment. \n\nEven rapidly immobilized
    fractures may require surgical treatment, including use of a headless compression
    screw such as the Herbert screw to bind the two halves together.\nHealing of
    the fracture with a non-anatomic deformity (frequently, a volar flexed \"humpback\")
    can also lead to post-traumatic arthritis. \n\nNon-unions can result in loss
    of blood supply to the proximal pole, which can result in avascular necrosis
    of the proximal segment.\nScaphoid fractures may be difficult to diagnose via
    plain x-ray, so repeat x-ray may be used at a later date, or cross-sectional
    imaging via MRI or CT scan.\n\n\n=== Other diseases ===\n\nA condition called
    scapholunate instability can occur when the scapholunate ligament (connecting
    the scaphoid to the lunate bone) and other surrounding ligaments are disrupted.
    \n\nIn this state, the distance between the scaphoid and lunate bones is increased.:\u200A180\u200AThere
    is a rare disease of this bone called Preiser's Disease.\n\n\n=== Palpation ===\n\nThe
    scaphoid can be palpated at the base of the anatomical snuff box. \n\nIt can
    also be palpated in the volar (palmar) hand/wrist. \n\nIts position is the intersections
    of the long axes of the four fingers while in a fist, or the base of the thenar
    eminence. \n\nWhen palpated in this position, the bone will be felt to slide
    forward during radial deviation (wrist abduction) and flexion.\nClicking of the
    scaphoid or no anterior translation can indicate scapholunate instability.\n\n\n==
    Etymology ==\n\nThe etymology of the scaphoid bone (Greek: \u03C3\u03BA\u03B1\u03C6\u03BF\u03B5\u03B9\u03B4\u03AD\u03C2)
    is derived from the Greek skaphos, which means \"a boat,\" and the Greek eidos,
    which means \"kind\". \n\nThe name refers to the shape of the bone, supposedly
    reminiscent of a boat. \n\nIn older literature about human anatomy, the scaphoid
    is referred to as the navicular bone of the hand (this time from the Latin word
    \u201Cnavis\u201D = boat), since there is also a bone in a similar position in
    the foot which is called the navicular. \n\nThe medical term for the bone is
    the scaphoid, as the term \"navicular\" is solely reserved for the bone located
    in the tarsals of the human body.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaphoid_bone"

  descriptionText: "\n\nPREMOLAR\n\n\nThe premolars, also called premolar teeth,
    or bicuspids, are transitional teeth located between the canine and molar teeth.
    \n\nIn humans, there are two premolars per quadrant in the permanent set of teeth,
    making eight premolars total in the mouth. \n\nThey have at least two cusps.
    \n\nPremolars can be considered transitional teeth during chewing, or mastication.
    \n\nThey have properties of both the canines, that lay anterior and molars that
    lay posterior, and so food can be transferred from the canines to the premolars
    and finally to the molars for grinding, instead of directly from the canines
    to the molars.\n\n\n== Human anatomy ==\n\nThe premolars in humans are the maxillary
    first premolar, maxillary second premolar, mandibular first premolar, and the
    mandibular second premolar. \n\nPremolar teeth by definition are permanent teeth
    distal to the canines, preceded by deciduous molars.\n\n\n=== Morphology ===\n\nThere
    is always one large buccal cusp, especially so in the mandibular first premolar.
    \n\nThe lower second premolar almost always presents with two lingual cusps.The
    lower premolars and the upper second premolar usually have one root. \n\nThe
    upper first usually has two roots, but can have just one root, notably in Sinodonts,
    and can sometimes have three roots.Premolars are unique to the permanent dentition.
    \n\nPremolars are referred to as bicuspid (has two main cusps), a buccal and
    a palatal/lingual cusp which are separated by a mesiodistal occlusal fissure.\nThe
    maxillary premolars are trapezoidal in shape. \n\nWhilst the mandibular premolars
    are rhomboidal in shape.\n\n\n==== Maxillary first premolar ====\nThe crown of
    the tooth appears ovoid, wider buccally than palatally\nFrom a buccal view, the
    first premolar is similar to the adjacent canine\nRoots: Two roots buccal and
    palatal. \n\nSometimes (40%) there is only one root.\n\n\n==== Maxillary second
    premolar ====\nSimilar to maxillary first premolar but the mesio-buccal and disto-buccal
    corners are rounder\nThe two cusps are smaller and more equal in size\nShorter
    occlusal fissure\nUsually one root\n\n\n==== Mandibular first premolar ====\n\n-The
    smallest premolar out of all four\n-Dominant buccal cusp and a very small lingual
    cusp\n-The buccal cusp is broad and the lingual cusp is less than half the size
    of the buccal cusp.\n-Two-thirds of the buccal surface can be seen from the occlusal
    aspect\n-A single conical root with an oval/round cross section. \n-The root
    is grooved longitudinally both mesially and distally.\n\n\n==== Mandibular second
    premolar ====\n\nThe crown is larger than the mandibular first premolar\nLingual
    cusp is smaller than the buccal cusp but better developed.\n\nThe lingual and
    buccal cusp is separated by a well defined mesiodistal occlusal fissure\n\nThe
    lingual cusp is divided into two; the mesiolingual and distolingual cusps with
    the mesiolingual cusp being higher and wider than the distolingual.\n\nRoot:
    Single conical root, oval/round in cross section.\n\n\n== Orthodontics ==\n\nThe
    four first premolars are the most commonly removed teeth, in 48.8% of cases,
    when teeth are removed for orthodontic treatment (which is in 45.8% of orthodontic
    patients). \n\nThe removal of only the maxillary first premolars is the second
    likeliest option, in 14.5% of cases.\n\n\n== Other mammals ==\n\nIn primitive
    placental mammals there are four premolars per quadrant, but the most mesial
    two (closer to the front of the mouth) have been lost in catarrhines (Old World
    monkeys and apes, including humans). \n\nPaleontologists therefore refer to human
    premolars as Pm3 and Pm4.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premolar"

  descriptionText: "\n\nCOSTAL CARTILAGE(S)\n\n\nThe costal cartilages are bars of
    hyaline cartilage that serve to prolong the ribs forward and contribute to the
    elasticity of the walls of the thorax. \n\nCostal cartilage is only found at
    the anterior ends of the ribs, providing medial extension.\n\n\n== Differences
    from Ribs 1-12 ==\n\nThe first seven pairs are connected with the sternum; the
    next three are each articulated with the lower border of the cartilage of the
    preceding rib; the last two have pointed extremities, which end in the wall of
    the abdomen.Like the ribs, the costal cartilages vary in their length, breadth,
    and direction. \n\nThey increase in length from the first to the seventh, then
    gradually decrease to the twelfth.\n\nTheir breadth, as well as that of the intervals
    between them, diminishes from the first to the last. \n\nThey are broad at their
    attachments to the ribs, and taper toward their sternal extremities, excepting
    the first two, which are of the same breadth throughout, and the sixth, seventh,
    and eighth, which are enlarged where their margins are in contact.\n\nThey also
    vary in direction: the first descends a little to the sternum, the second is
    horizontal, the third ascends slightly, while the others are angular, following
    the course of the ribs for a short distance, and then ascending to the sternum
    or preceding cartilage.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nEach costal cartilage presents
    two surfaces, two borders, and two extremities.\n\n\n=== Surfaces ===\n\nThe
    anterior surface is convex, and looks forward and upward: that of the first gives
    attachment to the costoclavicular ligament and the subclavius muscle; those of
    the first six or seven at their sternal ends, to the pectoralis major. \n\nThe
    others are covered by, and give partial attachment to, some of the flat muscles
    of the abdomen.\n\nThe posterior surface is concave, and directed backward and
    downward; that of the first gives attachment to the sternothyroideus, those of
    the third to the sixth inclusive to the transversus thoracis muscle, and the
    six or seven inferior ones to the transversus abdominis muscle and the diaphragm.\n\n\n===
    Borders ===\n\nOf the two borders the superior is concave, the inferior convex;
    they afford attachment to the intercostales interni: the upper border of the
    sixth gives attachment also to the pectoralis major.\n\nThe inferior borders
    of the sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth cartilages present heel-like projections
    at the points of greatest convexity. \n\nThese projections carry smooth oblong
    facets which articulate with facets on slight projections from the upper borders
    of the seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth cartilages, respectively.\n\n\n=== Interchondral
    articulations ===\n\nThe interchondral articulations are the joints formed between
    the costal cartilages of the ribs. \n\nThe contiguous borders of the sixth, seventh,
    and eighth, and sometimes those of the ninth and tenth, costal cartilages articulate
    with each other by small, smooth, oblong facets. \n\nEach articulation is enclosed
    in a thin articular capsule, lined by synovial membrane and strengthened laterally
    and medially by ligamentous fibers (interchondral ligaments) which pass from
    one cartilage to the other. \n\nSometimes the fifth costal cartilages, more rarely
    the ninth and tenth, articulate by their lower borders with the adjoining cartilages
    by small oval facets; more frequently the connection is by a few ligamentous
    fibers.\n\n\n=== Extremities ===\n\nThe lateral end of each cartilage is continuous
    with the osseous tissue of the rib to which it belongs.\n\nThe medial end of
    the first is continuous with the sternum; the medial ends of the six succeeding
    ones are rounded and are received into shallow concavities on the lateral margins
    of the sternum.\n\nThe medial ends of the eighth, ninth, and tenth costal cartilages
    are pointed, and are connected each with the cartilage immediately above.\n\nThose
    of the eleventh and twelfth are pointed and free.\n\n\n== Clinical significance
    ==\n\nIn old age, the costal cartilages are prone to superficial ossification.In
    costochondritis and Tietze syndrome, inflammation of the costal cartilage occurs.
    \n\nThis is a common cause of chest pain.Severe trauma may lead to fracture of
    the costal cartilage. \n\nSuch injuries often go unnoticed during x-ray scans,
    but can be diagnosed with CT scans. \n\nSurgery is typically used to fix the
    costal cartilage back onto either the rib or sternum.Costal cartilage may be
    harvested for reparative use elsewhere in the body. \n\nWhilst this is typically
    conducted using a general anaesthetic, IV sedation can also be used. \n\nThe
    procedure presents a minor risk of pleural tear.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costal_cartilage"

  descriptionText: "\n\nMETACARPAL BONES\n\n\nIn human anatomy, the metacarpal bones
    or metacarpus, form the intermediate part of the skeletal hand located between
    the phalanges of the fingers and the carpal bones of the wrist which forms the
    connection to the forearm. \n\nThe metacarpal bones are analogous to the metatarsal
    bones in the foot.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\n\nThe metacarpals form a transverse
    arch to which the rigid row of distal carpal bones are fixed. \n\nThe peripheral
    metacarpals (those of the thumb and little finger) form the sides of the cup
    of the palmar gutter and as they are brought together they deepen this concavity.
    \n\nThe index metacarpal is the most firmly fixed, while the thumb metacarpal
    articulates with the trapezium and acts independently from the others. \n\nThe
    middle metacarpals are tightly united to the carpus by intrinsic interlocking
    bone elements at their bases. \n\nThe ring metacarpal is somewhat more mobile
    while the fifth metacarpal is semi-independent.Each metacarpal bone consists
    of a body or shaft, and two extremities: the head at the distal or digital end
    (near the fingers), and the base at the proximal or carpal end (close to the
    wrist).\n\n\n=== Body ===\n\nThe body (shaft) is prismoid in form, and curved,
    so as to be convex in the longitudinal direction behind, concave in front. \n\nIt
    presents three surfaces: medial, lateral, and dorsal.\n\nThe medial and lateral
    surfaces are concave, for the attachment of the interosseus muscles, and separated
    from one another by a prominent anterior ridge.\n\nThe dorsal surface presents
    in its distal two-thirds a smooth, triangular, flattened area which is covered
    in by the tendons of the extensor muscles. \n\nThis surface is bounded by two
    lines, which commence in small tubercles situated on either side of the digital
    extremity, and, passing upward, converge and meet some distance above the center
    of the bone and form a ridge which runs along the rest of the dorsal surface
    to the carpal extremity. \n\nThis ridge separates two sloping surfaces for the
    attachment of the interossei dorsales.\n\nTo the tubercles on the digital extremities
    are attached the collateral ligaments of the metacarpophalangeal joints.\n\n\n===
    Base ===\n\nThe base (basis) or carpal extremity is of a cuboidal form, and broader
    behind than in front: it articulates with the carpal bones and with the adjoining
    metacarpal bones; its dorsal and volar surfaces are rough, for the attachment
    of ligaments.\n\n\n=== Head ===\n\nThe head (caput) or digital extremity presents
    an oblong surface markedly convex from before backward, less so transversely,
    and flattened from side to side; it articulates with the proximal phalanx. \n\nIt
    is broader, and extends farther upward, on the volar than on the dorsal aspect,
    and is longer in the antero-posterior than in the transverse diameter. \n\nOn
    either side of the head is a tubercle for the attachment of the collateral ligament
    of the metacarpophalangeal joint.\n\nThe dorsal surface, broad and flat, supports
    the tendons of the extensor muscles.\n\nThe volar surface is grooved in the middle
    line for the passage of the flexor tendons, and marked on either side by an articular
    eminence continuous with the terminal articular surface.\n\n\n=== Neck ===\n\nThe
    neck, or subcapital segment, is the transition zone between the body and the
    head.\n\n\n=== Articulations ===\n\nBesides the metacarpophalangeal joints, the
    metacarpal bones articulate by carpometacarpal joints as follows:\n\n-the first
    with the trapezium;\n-the second with the trapezium, trapezoid, capitate and
    third metacarpal;\n-the third with the capitate and second and fourth metacarpals;\n-the
    fourth with the capitate, hamate, and third and fifth metacarpals;\n-and the
    fifth with the hamate and fourth metacarpal;\n        \n\n\n=== Insertions ===\n\n-Extensor
    Carpi Radialis Longus/Brevis: Both insert on the base of metacarpal II; Assist
    with wrist extension and radial flexion of the wrist\n-Extensor Carpi Ulnaris:
    Inserts on the base of metacarpal V; Extends and fixes wrist when digits are
    being flexed; assists with ulnar flexion of wrist\n-Abductor Pollicis Longus:
    Inserts on the trapezium and base of metacarpal I; Abducts thumb in frontal plane;
    extends thumb at carpometacarpal joint\n-Opponens Pollicis: Inserts on metacarpal
    I; flexes metacarpal I to oppose the thumb to the fingertips\n-Opponens digiti
    minimi: Inserts on the medial surface of metacarpal V; Flexes metacarpal V at
    carpometacarpal joint when little finger is moved into opposition with tip of
    thumb; deepens palm of hand.\n\n        \n\n\n== Clinical significance ==\n\n===
    Congenital disorders ===\n\nThe fourth and fifth metacarpal bones are commonly
    \"blunted\" or shortened, in pseudohypoparathyroidism and pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism.\n\nA
    blunted fourth metacarpal, with normal fifth metacarpal, can signify Turner syndrome.\n\nBlunted
    metacarpals (particularly the fourth metacarpal) are a symptom of Nevoid basal
    cell carcinoma syndrome.\n\n\n=== Fracture ===\n\nThe neck of a metacarpal is
    a common location for a boxer's fracture. \n\nHowever, all parts of the metacarpal
    bone (including head, body and base) are susceptible to fracture. \n\nFor these
    fractures several types of treatment exist ranging from non-operative techniques
    with or without immobilization to operative techniques using closed or open reduction
    and internal fixation (ORIF). \n\nGenerally speaking most fractures showing little
    or no displacement can be treated successfully without surgery. \n\nIntraarticular
    fracture-dislocations of the metacarpal head or base may require surgical fixation,
    as fragment displacement affecting the joint surface is rarely tolerated well.\n\n\n==
    Other animals ==\n\nIn four-legged animals, the metacarpals form part of the
    forefeet, and are frequently reduced in number, appropriate to the number of
    toes. \n\nIn digitigrade and unguligrade animals, the metacarpals are greatly
    extended and strengthened, forming an additional segment to the limb, a feature
    that typically enhances the animal's speed. \n\nIn both birds and bats, the metacarpals
    form part of the wing.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Etymology ===\n\nThe Greek physician
    Galen used to refer to the metacarpus as \u03BC\u03B5\u03C4\u03B1\u03BA\u03AC\u03C1\u03C0\u03B9\u03BF\u03BD.
    \n\nThe Latin form metacarpium more truly resembles its Ancient Greek predecessor
    \u03BC\u03B5\u03C4\u03B1\u03BA\u03AC\u03C1\u03C0\u03B9\u03BF\u03BD than metacarpus.
    \n\nMeta\u2013 is Greek for beyond and carpal from Ancient Greek \u03BA\u03B1\u03C1\u03C0\u03CC\u03C2
    (karp\xF3s, \u201Cwrist\u201D).\n\nIn anatomic Latin, adjectives like metacarpius,
    metacarpicus, metacarpiaeus, metacarpeus, metacarpianus and metacarpalis can
    be found. \n\nThe form metacarpius is more true to the later Greek form \u03BC\u03B5\u03C4\u03B1\u03BA\u03AC\u03C1\u03C0\u03B9\u03BF\u03C2.
    \n\nMetacarpalis, as in ossa metacarpalia in the current official Latin nomenclature,
    Terminologia Anatomica is a compound consisting of Latin and Greek parts. \n\nThe
    usage of such hybrids in anatomic Latin is disapproved by some.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacarpal_bones"

  descriptionText: "\n\nFRONTAL SINUS/\nSINUS OF FRONTAL BONE\n\n\nThe frontal sinuses
    are one of the four pairs of paranasal sinuses that are situated behind the brow
    ridges. \n\nSinuses are mucosa-lined airspaces within the bones of the face and
    skull. \n\nEach opens into the anterior part of the corresponding middle nasal
    meatus of the nose through the frontonasal duct which traverses the anterior
    part of the labyrinth of the ethmoid. \n\nThese structures then open into the
    semilunar hiatus in the middle meatus.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\n\nFrontal sinuses
    are rarely symmetrical and the septum between them frequently deviates to one
    or other side of the middle line. \n\nTheir average measurements are as follows:
    height 28 mm, breadth 24 mm, depth 20 mm, creating a space of 6-7 ml.\n\nThe
    mucous membrane in this sinus is innervated by the supraorbital nerve, which
    carries the postganglionic parasympathetic nerve fibers for mucous secretion
    from the ophthalmic nerve and supplied by the supraorbital artery and anterior
    ethmoidal artery.\n\n\n=== Development ===\n\nThe frontal sinuses are absent
    at birth, but are generally well developed, and functional between the sixth
    and eighth years, though they continue to grow slower until reaching their maximum
    size after puberty. \n\nThis is why many children experience suddenly increased
    mucus production at this age and learn to react accordingly. \n\nThe frontal
    bone is membranous at birth and the sinus region is occupied by a developing
    recess until bodily development hastens and bones begin to ossify at age two.
    \n\nConsequently, this structure does not show on radiographs before that time. 
    Sinus development begins in the womb, the maxillary and ethmoid sinuses are present
    at birth. \n\nSphenoidal sinuses are present at birth as well but are very small.
    \n\nApproximately 5% of people have absent frontal sinuses.\n\n\n== Function
    ==\n\nThrough its copious mucus production, the sinus is an essential part of
    the immune defense/air filtration carried out by the nose. \n\nNasal and sinal
    mucosae are ciliated and move mucus to the choanae and finally to the stomach.
    \n\nThe thick upper layers of nasal mucus trap bacteria and small particles in
    tissue abundantly provided with immune cells, antibodies, and antibacterial proteins.
    \n\nThe layers beneath are thinner and provide a substrate in which the cilia
    are able to beat and move the upper layer with its debris through the ostia toward
    the choanae.\n\n\n== Clinical significance ==\n\nInfection of the frontal sinus
    causing sinusitis can give rise to serious complications, as it is in close proximity
    to the orbit and cranial cavity (orbital cellulitis, epidural and subdural abscess,
    meningitis).\n\nEndonasal approach into the frontal sinus in children with acute
    and chronic frontal sinusitis without the usage of surgical optics is not successful,
    because in this case the operation is performed almost blindly and technically
    difficult even in adults.\n\n\n=== Fractures ===\n\nFrontal sinus fractures occur
    from trauma to the part of the frontal bone that overlies the sinus, often from
    motor vehicle accidents and falls. \n\nThe hallmarks of a frontal sinus fracture
    is a frontal depression in the anterior table of the bone. \n\nAdditionally,
    clear fluid leaking from the nose may indicate that fractures to the posterior
    table have torn into the dura mater, creating a cerebrospinal fluid leak.\n\nGoals
    in management are to protect the intracranial structure, control any existing
    CSF leakage, prevent late complications, and aesthetically correct the deformity
    caused, if any. \n\nIn anterior table fractures, if the table is minimally displaced,
    there will be no treatment necessary, only observation. \n\nIf largely displaced,
    the correction is open reduction and internal fixation. \n\nIf inhibiting the
    nasofrontal outflow tract, procedure is to undergo open reduction and internal
    fixation of the anterior table and osteoplastic flap with obliteration.\n\nIn
    posterior table fractures, a nondiplaced fracture with no CSF leak will only
    be observed. \n\nThose with a CSF leak will undergo sinus exploration if the
    CSF leak is not internally resolved within 4 to 7 days. \n\nWith more dramatic
    displacements, sinus exploration will be required to determine the required level
    of cranialization, obliteration, and reparation to the dura.\n\n\n=== Aesthetic
    reconstruction ===\n\nIn the case of facial feminization surgery, modifications
    to the frontal sinus can be made to make the face more feminine, alongside softening
    the orbital rims. \n\nThe forehead operations for feminization were first described
    by Dr. \n\nDouglas Ousterhout in the 1980s. \n\nThose operations consisted of
    four different techniques based on the anatomy of the patient. \n\nThey were
    named arbitrarily by number (Type 1, Type 2, Type 3 and Type 4), with no particular
    relevance to their level of difficulty or frequency.\n\nType 1The Type I forehead
    describes a forehead with an absent frontal sinus or alternatively with sufficiently
    thick bone overlaying the frontal sinus so that burring alone is enough to correct
    the forehead. \n\nThis type of forehead tends to occur in approximately 3% to
    5% of the population. \n\nIn these situations, the operation consists of using
    rotary instruments to shape and contour the bone to the desired level, while
    observing the thickness of the bone to avoid penetrating the intracranial space.
    \n\nThe main risks associated with this operation tend to be bleeding. \n\nThere
    are often venous lakes present throughout the frontal bone.\n\nType 2The Type
    II forehead describes another uncommon situation. \n\nThis describes a patient
    with brow bossing; however, the bossing is at the correction position in terms
    of prominence. \n\nTherefore, the problem lies primarily above the bossing. \n\nWe
    see this forehead type at about the same frequency as we see the Type I forehead.
    \n\nThe Type II forehead is corrected by using a filling material such as methyl
    methacrylate.7 Other materials may be more ideal at this point; however, none
    are superior in terms of cost to methyl methacrylate. \n\nAlthough many surgeons
    do not consider the cost of the materials they are using, hydroxyapatite and
    calcium phos-phate bone cements cost approximately 1000 times that of methyl
    methacrylate. \n\nThe advantage of bone cement is its adherence to the underlying
    bone, and the more analogous nature to native bone substrate. \n\nThe material
    is applied to fill in the area above the bossing, and then gently contoured to
    blend with the transverse forehead bossing thereby-creating a uniformly round
    forehead\n\nType 3The Type III forehead is the most common situation and occurs
    in more than 90% of patients. \n\nThe forehead, in this situation, has a prominent
    bossing across the top of the brows, and that bossing is overly projected. \n\nA
    frontal sinus is present. \n\nThe thinness of the sinus precludes using exclusively
    rotary instruments to thin the bone. \n\nAn osteotomy and reconstruction are
    the only operations to provide the proper round shape to the forehead with the
    decreased prominence that is necessary for a soft forehead, which involves a
    setback of the anterior table of the frontal sinus. \n\nThis procedure is described
    as Type 3 Forehead Cranioplasty.\n\nType 4This operation can be described as
    an extended Type II operation. \n\nIn this situation, the entire forehead is
    diminutive, including the area underlying the brows, and the entire forehead
    requires augmentation. \n\nRegardless of the material type, care should be taken
    to avoid having the implant sit directly underneath the incision as this leads
    to a higher rate of infection and removal.\n\nTreatment of the orbital rim is
    almost always necessary in all these various forehead operations, regardless
    of what is done with the frontal bossing.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontal_sinus"

  descriptionText: "\n\nHAMATE BONE\n\n\nThe hamate bone (from Latin hamatus, \"hooked\"),
    or unciform bone (from Latin uncus, \"hook\") is a bone in the human wrist readily
    distinguishable by its wedge shape and a hook-like process (\"hamulus\") projecting
    from its palmar surface.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe hamate is an irregularly
    shaped carpal bone found within the hand. \n\nThe hamate is found within the
    distal row of carpal bones, and abuts the metacarpals of the little finger and
    ring finger.\n\nAdjacent to the hamate on the ulnar side, and slightly above
    it, is the pisiform bone. \n\nAdjacent on the radial side is the capitate, and
    proximal is the lunate bone.\n\n\n=== Surfaces ===\n\nThe hamate bone has six
    surfaces:\n\nThe superior, the apex of the wedge, is narrow, convex, smooth,
    and articulates with the lunate.\n\nThe inferior articulates with the fourth
    and fifth metacarpal bones, by concave facets which are separated by a ridge.\n\nThe
    dorsal is triangular and rough for ligamentous attachment.\n\nThe palmar presents,
    at its lower and ulnar side, a curved, hook-like process, the hamulus, directed
    forward and laterally.\n\nThe medial articulates with the triangular bone by
    an oblong facet, cut obliquely from above, downward and medialward.\n\nThe lateral
    articulates with the capitate by its upper and posterior part, the remaining
    portion being rough, for the attachment of ligaments.\n\n\n=== Hook ===\n\nThe
    hook of hamate (Latin: hamulus) is found at the proximal, ulnar side of the hamate
    bone. \n\nThe hook is a curved, hook-like process that projects 1\u20132 mm distally
    and radially. \n\nThe ulnar nerve hooks around the hook of hamate as it crosses
    towards the medial side of hand. \n\nThe hook forms the ulnar border of the carpal
    tunnel, and the radial border for Guyon's canal. \n\nNumerous structures attach
    to it, including ligaments from the pisiform, the transverse carpal ligament,
    and the tendon of Flexor carpi ulnaris.\n\nIts medial surface to the flexor digiti
    minimi brevis and opponens digiti minimi; its lateral side is grooved for the
    passage of the flexor tendons into the palm of the hand.\n\n\n=== Development
    ===\n\nThe ossification of the hamate starts between 1 and 12 months. \n\nThe
    hamate does not fully ossify until about the 15th year of life.\n\n\n=== In animals
    ===\n\nThe bone is also found in many other mammals, and is homologous with the
    \"fourth distal carpal\" of reptiles and amphibians.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\nThe
    carpal bones function as a unit to provide a bony superstructure for the hand.:\u200A708\u200A\n\n\n==
    Clinical significance ==\n\nThe hamate bone is the bone most commonly fractured
    when a golfer hits the ground hard with a golf club on the downswing or a hockey
    player hits the ice with a slap shot. \n\nThe fracture is usually a hairline
    fracture, commonly missed on normal X-rays. \n\nSymptoms are pain aggravated
    by gripping, tenderness over the hamate and symptoms of irritation of the ulnar
    nerve. \n\nThis is characterized by numbness and weakness of the pinkie finger
    with partial involvement of the ring finger as well, the \"ulnar 1\xBD fingers\".\n\nThe
    hook of hamate is particularly prone to fracture-related complications such as
    non-union due to its tenuous blood supply.\n\nIt is also a common injury in baseball
    players. \n\nSeveral professional baseball players have had the bone removed
    during the course of their careers. \n\nThis condition has been called \"Wilson's
    Wrist\".\n\nThe calcification of the unciform bone is seen on X-rays during puberty
    and is sometimes used in orthodontics to determine if an adolescent patient is
    suitable for orthognathic intervention (i.e. before or at their growth spurt).\n\n\n==
    Etymology ==\n\nThe etymology derives from the Latin hamatus \"hooked,\" from
    hamus which means \"hook\".\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamate_bone"

  descriptionText: "\n\nMOLAR (TOOTH)\n\n\nThe molars or molar teeth are large, flat
    teeth at the back of the mouth. \n\nThey are more developed in mammals. \n\nThey
    are used primarily to grind food during chewing. \n\nThe name molar derives from
    Latin, molaris dens, meaning \"millstone tooth\", from mola, millstone and dens,
    tooth. \n\nMolars show a great deal of diversity in size and shape across mammal
    groups. \n\nThe third molar of humans is sometimes vestigial.\n\n\n== Human anatomy
    ==\n\n\nIn humans, the molar teeth have either four or five cusps. \n\nAdult
    humans have 12 molars, in four groups of three at the back of the mouth. \n\nThe
    third, rearmost molar in each group is called a wisdom tooth. \n\nIt is the last
    tooth to appear, breaking through the front of the gum at about the age of 20,
    although this varies from individual to individual. \n\nRace can also affect
    the age at which this occurs, with statistical variations between groups. \n\nIn
    some cases, it may not even erupt at all.\nThe human mouth contains upper (maxillary)
    and lower (mandibular) molars. \n\nThey are: maxillary first molar, maxillary
    second molar, maxillary third molar, mandibular first molar, mandibular second
    molar, and mandibular third molar.\n\n\n== Mammal evolution ==\n\n\nIn mammals,
    the crown of the molars and premolars is folded into a wide range of complex
    shapes. \n\nThe basic elements of the crown are the more or less conical projections
    called cusps and the valleys that separate them. \n\nThe cusps contain both dentine
    and enamel, whereas minor projections on the crown, called crenulations, are
    the result of different enamel thickness. \n\nCusps are occasionally joined to
    form ridges and expanded to form crests. \n\nCingula are often incomplete ridges
    that pass around the base of the crown.Mammalian, multicusped cheek teeth probably
    evolved from single-cusped teeth in synapsids, although the diversity of therapsid
    molar patterns and the complexity in the molars of the earliest mammals make
    determining how this happened impossible. \n\nAccording to the widely accepted
    \"differentiation theory\", additional cusps have arisen by budding or outgrowth
    from the crown, while the rivalling \"concrescence theory\" instead proposes
    that complex teeth evolved by the clustering of originally separate conical teeth.
    \n\nTherian mammals (placentals and marsupials) are generally agreed to have
    evolved from an ancestor with tribosphenic cheek teeth, with three main cusps
    arranged in a triangle.\n\n\n== Morphology ==\n\n\nEach major cusp on an upper
    molar is called a cone and is identified by a prefix dependent on its relative
    location on the tooth: proto-, para-, meta-, hypo-, and ento-. \n\nSuffixes are
    added to these names: -id is added to cusps on a lower molar (e.g., protoconid);
    -ule to a minor cusp (e.g., protoconulid). \n\nA shelf-like ridge on the lower
    part of the crown (on an upper molar) is called a cingulum; the same feature
    on the lower molar a cingulid, and a minor cusp on these, for example, a cingular
    cuspule or conulid.\n\n\n=== Tribosphenic ===\n\n\nThe design that is considered
    one of the most important characteristics of mammals is a three-cusped shape
    called a tribosphenic molar. \n\nThis molar design has two important features:
    the trigonid, or shearing end, and the talonid, or crushing heel. \n\nIn modern
    tribosphenic molars, the trigonid is towards the front of the jaw and the talonid
    is towards the rear.\n\nThe tribosphenic tooth is found in insectivores and young
    platypuses (adults have no teeth). \n\nUpper molars look like three-pointed mountain
    ranges; lowers look like two peaks and a third off to the side.\nThe tribosphenic
    design appears primitively in all groups of mammals. \n\nSome paleontologists
    believe that it developed independently in monotremes (or australosphenidans),
    rather than being inherited from an ancestor that they share with marsupials
    and placentals (or boreosphenidans); but this idea has critics and the debate
    is still going on. \n\nFor example, the dentition of the Early Cretaceous monotreme
    Steropodon is similar to those of Peramus and dryolestoids, which suggests that
    monotremes are related to some pre-tribosphenic therian mammals, but, on the
    other hand, the status of neither of these two groups is well-established.\n\nSome
    Jurassic mammals, such as Shuotherium and Pseudotribos, have \"reversed tribosphenic\"
    molars, in which the talonid is towards the front. \n\nThis variant is regarded
    as an example of convergent evolution.From the primitive tribosphenic tooth,
    molars have diversified into several unique morphologies. \n\nIn many groups,
    a fourth cusp, the hypocone (hypoconid), subsequently evolved (see below).\n\n\n===
    Quadrate ===\n\n\nQuadrate (also called quadritubercular or euthemorphic) molars
    have an additional fourth cusp on the lingual (tongue) side called the hypocone,
    located posterior to the protocone. \n\nQuadrate molars appeared early in mammal
    evolution and are present in many species, including hedgehogs, raccoons, and
    many primates, including humans.\n\nThere may be a fifth cusp.\n\nIn many mammals,
    additional smaller cusps called conules appear between the larger cusps. \n\nThey
    are named after their locations, e.g. a paraconule is located between a paracone
    and a metacone, a hypoconulid is located between a hypoconid and an entoconid.\n\n\n===
    Bunodont ===\n\n\nIn bunodont molars, the cusps are low and rounded hills rather
    than sharp peaks. \n\nThey are most common among omnivores such as pigs, bears,
    and humans. \n\nBunodont molars are effective crushing devices and often basically
    quadrate in shape.\n\n\n=== Hypsodont ===\n\nHypsodont dentition is characterized
    by high-crowned teeth and enamel that extends far past the gum line, which provides
    extra material for wear and tear. \n\nSome examples of animals with hypsodont
    dentition are cattle and horses, all animals that feed on gritty, fibrous material.
    \n\nHypsodont molars can continue to grow throughout life, for example in some
    species of Arvicolinae (herbivorous rodents).Hypsodont molars lack both a crown
    and a neck. \n\nThe occlusal surface is rough and mostly flat, adapted for crushing
    and grinding plant material. \n\nThe body is covered with cementum both above
    and below the gingival line, below which is a layer of enamel covering the entire
    length of the body. \n\nThe cementum and the enamel invaginate into the thick
    layer of dentin.\n\n\n=== Brachydont ===\n\nThe opposite condition to hypsodont
    is called brachydont or brachyodont (from brachys 'short'). \n\nIt is a type
    of dentition characterized by low-crowned teeth. \n\nHuman teeth are brachydont.A
    brachydont tooth has a crown above the gingival line and a neck just below it,
    and at least one root. \n\nA cap of enamel covers the crown and extends down
    to the neck. \n\nCementum is only found below the gingival line. \n\nThe occlusal
    surfaces tend to be pointed, well-suited for holding prey and tearing and shredding.\n\n\n===
    Zalambdodont ===\n\nZalambdodont molars have three cusps, one larger on the lingual
    side and two smaller on the labial side, joined by two crests that form a V-
    or \u03BB-shape. \n\nThe larger inner cusp might be homologous with the paracone
    in a tribosphenic molar, but can also be fused with the metacone. \n\nThe protocone
    is typically missing. \n\nThe two smaller labial cusps are located on an expanded
    shelf called the stylar shelf. \n\nZalambdodont molars are found in, for example,
    golden moles and solenodons.\n\n\n=== Dilambdodont ===\n\nLike zalambdodont molars,
    dilambdodont molars have a distinct ectoloph, but are shaped like two lambdas
    or a W. \n\nOn the lingual side, at the bottom of the W, are the metacone and
    paracone, and the stylar shelf is on the labial side. \n\nA protocone is present
    lingual to the ectoloph. \n\nDilambdodont molars are present in shrews, moles,
    and some insectivorous bats.\n\n\n=== Lophodont ===\n\n\nLophodont teeth are
    easily identified by the differentiating patterns of ridges or lophs of enamel
    interconnecting the cusps on the crowns. \n\nPresent in most herbivores, these
    patterns of lophs can be a simple, ring-like edge, as in mole rats, or a complex
    arrangement of series of ridges and cross-ridges, as those in odd-toed ungulates,
    such as equids.Lophodont molars have hard and elongated enamel ridges called
    lophs oriented either along or perpendicular to the dental row. \n\nLophodont
    molars are common in herbivores that grind their food thoroughly. \n\nExamples
    include tapirs, manatees, and many rodents.When two lophs form transverse, often
    ring-shaped, ridges on a tooth, the arrangement is called bilophodont. \n\nThis
    pattern is common in primates, but can also be found in lagomorphs (hares, rabbits,
    and pikas) and some rodents.\n\nExtreme forms of lophodonty in elephants and
    some rodents (such as Otomys) is known as loxodonty. \n\nThe African elephant
    belongs to a genus called Loxodonta because of this feature.\n\n\n=== Selenodont
    ===\n\nIn selenodont molars (so-named after moon goddess Selene), the major cusp
    is elongated into crescent-shaped ridge. \n\nExamples include most even-toed
    ungulates, such as cattle and deer.\n\n\n=== Secodont ===\n\n\nMany carnivorous
    mammals have enlarged and blade-like teeth especially adapted for slicing and
    chopping called carnassials. \n\nA general term for such blade-like teeth is
    secodont or plagiaulacoid.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_(tooth)"

  descriptionText: "\n\nSCAPULA\n\n\nIn anatomy, the scapula (plural scapulae or
    scapulas), also known as the shoulder bone, shoulder blade, wing bone, speal
    bone or blade bone, is the bone that connects the humerus (upper arm bone) with
    the clavicle (collar bone). \n\nLike their connected bones, the scapulae are
    paired, with each scapula on either side of the body being roughly a mirror image
    of the other. \n\nThe name derives from the Classical Latin word for trowel or
    small shovel, which it was thought to resemble.\n\nIn compound terms, the prefix
    omo- is used for the shoulder blade in medical terminology. \n\nThis prefix is
    derived from \u1F66\u03BC\u03BF\u03C2 (\u014Dmos), the Ancient Greek word for
    shoulder, and is cognate with the Latin (h)umerus, which in Latin signifies either
    the shoulder or the upper arm bone.\n\nThe scapula forms the back of the shoulder
    girdle. In humans, it is a flat bone, roughly triangular in shape, placed on
    a posterolateral aspect of the thoracic cage.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe scapula
    is a wide, flat bone lying on the thoracic wall that provides an attachment for
    three groups of muscles: intrinsic, extrinsic, and stabilising and rotating muscles.
    \n\nThe intrinsic muscles of the scapula include the muscles of the rotator cuff\u2014the
    subscapularis, teres minor, supraspinatus, and infraspinatus. \n\nThese muscles
    attach to the surface of the scapula and are responsible for the internal and
    external rotation of the shoulder joint, along with humeral abduction.\n\nThe
    extrinsic muscles include the biceps, triceps, and deltoid muscles and attach
    to the coracoid process and supraglenoid tubercle of the scapula, infraglenoid
    tubercle of the scapula, and spine of the scapula. \n\nThese muscles are responsible
    for several actions of the glenohumeral joint.\n\nThe third group, which is mainly
    responsible for stabilization and rotation of the scapula, consists of the trapezius,
    serratus anterior, levator scapulae, and rhomboid muscles. \n\nThese attach to
    the medial, superior, and inferior borders of the scapula.\n\nThe head, processes,
    and the thickened parts of the bone contain cancellous tissue; the rest consists
    of a thin layer of compact tissue.\n\nThe central part of the supraspinatus fossa
    and the upper part of the infraspinatous fossa, but especially the former, are
    usually so thin in humans as to be semitransparent; occasionally the bone is
    found wanting in this situation, and the adjacent muscles are separated only
    by fibrous tissue. \n\nThe scapula has two surfaces, three borders, three angles,
    and three processes.\n\n\n=== Surfaces ===\n\n===Front or subscapular fossa===\n\nThe
    front of the scapula (also known as the costal or ventral surface) has a broad
    concavity called the subscapular fossa, to which the subscapularis muscle attaches.
    \n\nThe medial two-thirds of the fossa have 3 longitudinal oblique ridges, and
    another thick ridge adjoins the lateral border; they run outward and upward.
    \n\nThe ridges give attachment to the tendinous insertions, and the surfaces
    between them to the fleshy fibers, of the subscapularis muscle. \n\nThe lateral
    third of the fossa is smooth and covered by the fibers of this muscle.\n\nAt
    the upper part of the fossa is a transverse depression, where the bone appears
    to be bent on itself along a line at right angles to and passing through the
    center of the glenoid cavity, forming a considerable angle, called the subscapular
    angle; this gives greater strength to the body of the bone by its arched form,
    while the summit of the arch serves to support the spine and acromion.\n\nThe
    costal surface superior of the scapula is the origin of 1st digitation for the
    serratus anterior origin.\n\n===Back===\n\nThe back of the scapula (also called
    the dorsal or posterior surface) is arched from above downward, and is subdivided
    into two unequal parts by the spine of the scapula. \n\nThe portion above the
    spine is called the supraspinous fossa, and that below it the infraspinous fossa.
    \n\nThe two fossae are connected by the spinoglenoid notch, situated lateral
    to the root of the spine.\n\nThe supraspinous fossa, above the spine of scapula,
    is concave, smooth, and broader at its vertebral than at its humeral end; its
    medial two-thirds give origin to the Supraspinatus. \n\nAt its lateral surface
    resides the spinoglenoid fossa which is situated by the medial margin of the
    glenoid. \n\nThe spinoglenoid fossa houses the suprascpular canal which forms
    a connecting passage between the suprascapular notch and the spinoglenoid notch
    conveying the suprascapular nerve and vessels.\n\nThe infraspinous fossa is much
    larger than the preceding; toward its vertebral margin a shallow concavity is
    seen at its upper part; its center presents a prominent convexity, while near
    the axillary border is a deep groove which runs from the upper toward the lower
    part. \n\nThe medial two-thirds of the fossa give origin to the Infraspinatus;
    the lateral third is covered by this muscle.\n\nThere is a ridge on the outer
    part of the back of the scapula. This runs from the lower part of the glenoid
    cavity, downward and backward to the vertebral border, about 2.5 cm above the
    inferior angle. \n\nAttached to the ridge is a fibrous septum, which separates
    the infraspinatus muscle from the Teres major and Teres minor muscles. \n\nThe
    upper two-thirds of the surface between the ridge and the axillary border is
    narrow, and is crossed near its center by a groove for the scapular circumflex
    vessels; the Teres minor attaches here.\n\nThe broad and narrow portions above
    alluded to are separated by an oblique line, which runs from the axillary border,
    downward and backward, to meet the elevated ridge: \n    to it is attached a
    fibrous septum which separates the Teres muscles from each other.\n\nIts lower
    third presents a broader, somewhat triangular surface, the inferior angle of
    the scapula, which gives origin to the Teres major, and over which the Latissimus
    dorsi glides; frequently the latter muscle takes origin by a few fibers from
    this part.\n\n===Side===\n\nThe acromion forms the summit of the shoulder, and
    is a large, somewhat triangular or oblong process, flattened from behind forward,
    projecting at first laterally, and then curving forward and upward, so as to
    overhang the glenoid cavity.\n\n\n=== Angles ===\n\nThere are 3 angles:\n\n   
    -The superior angle of the scapula or medial angle, is covered by the trapezius
    muscle. \n\nThis angle is formed by the junction of the superior and medial borders
    of the scapula. \n\nThe superior angle is located at the approximate level of
    the second thoracic vertebra. \n\nThe superior angle of the scapula is thin,
    smooth, rounded, and inclined somewhat lateralward, and gives attachment to a
    few fibers of the levator scapulae muscle.\n\n    -The inferior angle of the
    scapula is the lowest part of the scapula and is covered by the latissimus dorsi
    muscle. \n\nIt moves forwards round the chest when the arm is abducted. \n\nThe
    inferior angle is formed by the union of the medial and lateral borders of the
    scapula. \n\nIt is thick and rough and its posterior or back surface affords
    attachment to the teres major and often to a few fibers of the latissimus dorsi.
    \n\nThe anatomical plane that passes vertically through the inferior angle is
    named the scapular line.\n\n    -The lateral angle of the scapula or glenoid
    angle also known as the head of the scapula is the thickest part of the scapula.
    \n    \nIt is broad and bears the glenoid cavity on its articular surface which
    is directed forward, laterally and slightly upwards, and articulates with the
    head of the humerus. \n\nThe inferior angle is broader below than above and its
    vertical diameter is the longest. \n\nThe surface is covered with cartilage in
    the fresh state; and its margins, slightly raised, give attachment to a fibrocartilaginous
    structure, the glenoidal labrum, which deepens the cavity. \n\nAt its apex is
    a slight elevation, the supraglenoid tuberosity, to which the long head of the
    biceps brachii is attached.\n\nThe anatomic neck of the scapula is the slightly
    constricted portion which surrounds the head and is more distinct below and behind
    than above and in front. \n\nThe surgical neck of the scapula passes directly
    medial to the base of the coracoid process.\n\n\n=== Borders ===\n\nThere are
    three borders of the scapula:\n\n    -The superior border is the shortest and
    thinnest; it is concave, and extends from the superior angle to the base of the
    coracoid process. \n\nIt is referred to as the cranial border in animals.\n\nAt
    its lateral part is a deep, semicircular notch, the scapular notch, formed partly
    by the base of the coracoid process. \n\nThis notch is converted into a foramen
    by the superior transverse scapular ligament, and serves for the passage of the
    suprascapular nerve; sometimes the ligament is ossified.\n\nThe adjacent part
    of the superior border affords attachment to the omohyoideus.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n   
    -The axillary border (or \"lateral border\") is the thickest of the three. \n   
    \nIt begins above at the lower margin of the glenoid cavity, and inclines obliquely
    downward and backward to the inferior angle. \n\nIt is referred to as the caudal
    border in animals.\n\nIt begins above at the lower margin of the glenoid cavity,
    and inclines obliquely downward and backward to the inferior angle.\n\nImmediately
    below the glenoid cavity is a rough impression, the infraglenoid tuberosity,
    about 2.5 cm (1 in). in length, which gives origin to the long head of the triceps
    brachii; in front of this is a longitudinal groove, which extends as far as the
    lower third of this border, and affords origin to part of the subscapularis.\n\nThe
    inferior third is thin and sharp, and serves for the attachment of a few fibers
    of the teres major behind, and of the subscapularis in front.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n   
    -The medial border (also called the vertebral border or medial margin) is the
    longest of the three borders, and extends from the superior angle to the inferior
    angle. \n\nIn animals it is referred to as the dorsal border.Four muscles attach
    to the medial border. Serratus anterior has a long attachment on the anterior
    lip. \n\nThree muscles insert along the posterior lip: \n    the levator scapulae
    (uppermost), rhomboid minor (middle), and to the rhomboid major (lower middle).\t\t\n\n\n===
    Development ===\n\nThe scapula is ossified from 7 or more centers: one for the
    body, two for the coracoid process, two for the acromion, one for the vertebral
    border, and one for the inferior angle. \n\nOssification of the body begins about
    the second month of fetal life, by an irregular quadrilateral plate of bone forming,
    immediately behind the glenoid cavity. \n\nThis plate extends to form the chief
    part of the bone, the scapular spine growing up from its dorsal surface about
    the third month. \n\nOssification starts as membranous ossification before birth.
    After birth, the cartilaginous components would undergo endochondral ossification.
    \n\nThe larger part of the scapula undergoes membranous ossification. Some of
    the outer parts of the scapula are cartilaginous at birth, and would therefore
    undergo endochondral ossification.\n\nAt birth, a large part of the scapula is
    osseous, but the glenoid cavity, the coracoid process, the acromion, the vertebral
    border and the inferior angle are cartilaginous. \n\nFrom the 15th to the 18th
    month after birth, ossification takes place in the middle of the coracoid process,
    which as a rule becomes joined with the rest of the bone about the 15th year.\n\nBetween
    the 14th and 20th years, the remaining parts ossify in quick succession, and
    usually in the following order: first, in the root of the coracoid process, in
    the form of a broad scale; secondly, near the base of the acromion; thirdly,
    in the inferior angle and contiguous part of the vertebral border; fourthly,
    near the outer end of the acromion; fifthly, in the vertebral border.\n\nThe
    base of the acromion is formed by an extension from the spine; the two nuclei
    of the acromion unite, and then join with the extension from the spine. \n\nThe
    upper third of the glenoid cavity is ossified from a separate center (sub coracoid),
    which appears between the 10th and 11th years and joins between the 16th and
    the 18th years. \n\nFurther, an epiphysial plate appears for the lower part of
    the glenoid cavity, and the tip of the coracoid process frequently has a separate
    nucleus. \n\nThese various epiphyses are joined to the bone by the 25th year.\n\nFailure
    of bony union between the acromion and spine sometimes occurs (see os acromiale),
    the junction being effected by fibrous tissue, or by an imperfect articulation;
    in some cases of supposed fracture of the acromion with ligamentous union, it
    is probable that the detached segment was never united to the rest of the bone.\n\n\"In
    terms of comparative anatomy the human scapula represents two bones that have
    become fused together; the (dorsal) scapula proper and the (ventral) coracoid.
    \n\nThe epiphyseal line across the glenoid cavity is the line of fusion. They
    are the counterparts of the ilium and ischium of the pelvic girdle.\"\n\n\n==
    Function ==\n\nThe following muscles attach to the scapula:\n\n\n=== Movements
    ===\n\nMovements of the scapula are brought about by the scapular muscles. \n\nThe
    scapula can perform six actions:\n\nElevation: upper trapezius and levator scapulae\nDepression:
    lower trapezius\nRetraction (adduction): rhomboids and middle trapezius\nProtraction
    (abduction): serratus anterior\nUpward rotation: upper and lower trapezius, serratus
    anterior\nDownward rotation: rhomboids, Levator Scapulae, and Pec Minor\n\n\n==
    Clinical significance ==\n\n\n=== Scapular fractures ===\n\nBecause of its sturdy
    structure and protected location, fractures of the scapula are uncommon. When
    they do occur, they are an indication that severe chest trauma has occurred.\nScapular
    fractures involving the neck of the scapula have two patterns. \n\nOne (rare)
    type of fracture is through the anatomical neck of the scapula. The other more
    common type of fracture is through the surgical neck of the scapula. \n\nThe
    surgical neck exits medial to the coracoid process.An abnormally protruding inferior
    angle of the scapula is known as a winged scapula and can be caused by paralysis
    of the serratus anterior muscle. \n\nIn this condition the sides of the scapula
    nearest the spine are positioned outward and backward. \n\nThe appearance of
    the upper back is said to be wing-like. \n\nIn addition, any condition causing
    weakness of the serratus anterior muscle may cause scapular \"winging\".\n\n\n===
    Impingement syndrome ===\n\nThe scapula plays an important role in shoulder impingement
    syndrome.Abnormal scapular function is called scapular dyskinesis. \n\nOne action
    the scapula performs during a throwing or serving motion is elevation of the
    acromion process in order to avoid impingement of the rotator cuff tendons. \n\nIf
    the scapula fails to properly elevate the acromion, impingement may occur during
    the cocking and acceleration phase of an overhead activity. \n\nThe two muscles
    most commonly inhibited during this first part of an overhead motion are the
    serratus anterior and the lower trapezius. \n\nThese two muscles act as a force
    couple within the glenohumeral joint to properly elevate the acromion process,
    and if a muscle imbalance exists, shoulder impingement may develop.\n\n\n===
    Etymology ===\n\n==== Scapula/Scapulae ====\n\nThe name scapula as synonym of
    shoulder blade is of Latin origin. \n\nIt is commonly used in medical English
    and is part of the current official Latin nomenclature, Terminologia Anatomica.\n\nIn
    classical Latin scapula is only used in its plural scapulae. \n\nAlthough some
    sources mention that scapulae is used to refer during Roman antiquity to the
    shoulders  or to the shoulder blades, others persist in that the Romans used
    scapulae only to refer to the back, in contrast to the pectus, the Latin name
    for breast  or chest.\n\n\n==== Os latum scapularum and related ====\n\nThe Roman
    encyclopedist Aulus Cornelius Celsus who lived during the beginning of the era,
    also used scapulae to refer to the back. He used os latum scapularum to refer
    to the shoulder blade. \n\nThis expressions can be translated as broad (Latin:
    latum) bone (Latin: os) of the back (Latin: scapularum).\n\nA similar expression
    in ancient Greek can be seen in the writings of the Greek philosopher Aristoteles
    and in the writings of the Greek physician Galen. \n\nThey both use the name
    \u1F60\u03BC\u03BF\u03C0\u03BB\u03AC\u03C4\u03B7 to refer to the shoulder blade.
    \n\nThis compound consists of ancient Greek \u1F66\u03BC\u03BF\u03C2, shoulder 
    and \u03C0\u03BB\u03AC\u03C4\u03B7, blade  or flat or broad object. \u03A0\u03BB\u03AC\u03C4\u03B7
    in its plural \u03C0\u03BB\u03AC\u03C4\u03B1\u03B9 without \u1F66\u03BC\u03BF-
    was also used in ancient Greek to refer to the shoulder blades. \n\nIn anatomic
    Latin, \u1F60\u03BC\u03BF\u03C0\u03BB\u03AC\u03C4\u03B7 is Latinized as omoplata.The
    Latin word umerus is related to \u1F66\u03BC\u03BF\u03C2. \n\nThe Romans referred
    with umerus to what is now commonly known in English as the following 3 bones:
    humerus or the upper bone of the arm, the clavicle or the collarbone and the
    scapula or the shoulder blade. \n\nThe spelling humerus is actually incorrect
    in classical Latin.Those three bones were referred to as the ossa (Latin: bones)
    umeri (Latin: of the umerus). \n\nUmerus was also used to refer specifically
    to the shoulder. \n\nThis mirrors the use of \u1F66\u03BC\u03BF\u03C2 in ancient
    Greek as that could refer to the shoulder with the upper arm  or to the shoulder 
    alone.\nSince Celsus, the os umeri could refer specifically to the upper bone
    of the arm. \n\nThe 16th century anatomist Andreas Vesalius used humerus to refer
    to the clavicle. \n\nBesides the aforementioned os latum scapularum, Celsus used
    os latum umeri to refer to the shoulder blade. Similarly, Laurentius used the
    expression latitudo umeri (Latitudo = breadth, width ) to refer to the shoulder
    blade.\n\n\n==== Pala ====\n\nThe Roman physician Caelius Aurelianus (5th century)
    used pala to refer to the shoulder blade. \n\nThe name pala is normally used
    to refer to a spade in Latin and was therefore probably used by Caelius Aurelianus
    to describe the shoulder blade, as both exhibit a flat curvature.\n\n\n==== Spathula/\u03A3\u03C0\u03AC\u03B8\u03B7
    ====\n\nDuring the Middle Ages spathula was used to refer to the shoulder blade.
    \n\nSpathula is a diminutive of spatha, with the latter originally meaning broad,
    two-edged sword without a point, broad, flat, wooden instrument for stirring
    any liquid, a spattle, spatula  or spathe of the palm tree  and its diminutive
    used in classical and late Latin for referring to a leg of pork  or a little
    palmbranch.\n\nThe English word spatula is actually derived from Latin spatula,
    an orthographic variant of spathula. Oddly enough, classical Latin non-diminutive
    spatha can be translated as English spatula, while its Latin diminutive spatula
    is not translated as English spatula.\n\nLatin spatha is derived from ancient
    Greek \u03C3\u03C0\u03AC\u03B8\u03B7. Therefore, the form spathula is more akin
    to its origin than spatula. \n\nAncient Greek \u03C3\u03C0\u03AC\u03B8\u03B7
    has a similar meaning as Latin spatha, as any broad blade, and can also refer
    to a spatula or to the broad blade of a sword., but also to the blade of an oar.
    \n\nThe aforementioned \u03C0\u03BB\u03AC\u03C4\u03B1\u03B9 for shoulder blades
    was also used for blades of an oar. Concordantly \u03C3\u03C0\u03AC\u03B8\u03B7
    was also used to refer to the shoulder blade.\n\nThe English word spade, as well
    as the Dutch equivalent spade  is cognate with \u03C3\u03C0\u03AC\u03B8\u03B7.
    Please notice, that the aforementioned term pala as applied by Roman physician
    Caelius Aurelianus, also means spade. \n\nPala is probably related to the Latin
    verb pandere, to spread out, and to extend. \n\nThis verb is thought to be derived
    from an earlier form spandere, with the root spa-. \u03A3\u03C0\u03AC\u03B8\u03B7
    is actually derived from the similar root sp\u0113(i), that means to extend.\n\nIt
    seems that os latum scapularum, \u1F60\u03BC\u03BF\u03C0\u03BB\u03AC\u03C4\u03B7,
    \u03C0\u03BB\u03AC\u03C4\u03B1\u03B9, pala, spathula and \u03C3\u03C0\u03AC\u03B8\u03B7
    all refer to the same aspect of the shoulder blade, i.e. being a flat, broad
    blade, with the latter three words etymological related to each other.\n\n\n====
    Scapula after the Middle Ages ====\n\nAfter the Middle Ages, the name scapula
    for shoulder blade became dominant. \n\nThe word scapula can etymologically be
    explained by its relatedness to the ancient Greek verb \u03C3\u03BA\u03AC\u03C0\u03C4\u03B5\u03B9\u03BD,
    to dig. \n\nThis relatedness gives rise to several possible explanations.\nFirst,
    the noun \u03C3\u03BA\u03AC\u03C0\u03B5\u03C4\u03BF\u03C2, trench, and the scapula
    related noun \u03C3\u03BA\u03B1\u03C6\u03B7, are both derived from this verb
    and might connect scapula to the notion of concavity. The name scapula then may
    be related to the concavity of the bone that exists due to its spine. The designation
    scapulae is additionally seen as synonym of ancient Greek \u03C3\u03C5\u03BD\u03C9\u03BC\u03AF\u03B1,
    the space between the shoulder blades, that is obviously concave. \u03A3\u03C5\u03BD\u03C9\u03BC\u03AF\u03B1
    consists of \u03C3\u03CD\u03BD, together with, and \u1F66\u03BC\u03BF\u03C2,
    shoulder.Second, scapula, due to its relatedness to \u03C3\u03BA\u03AC\u03C0\u03C4\u03B5\u03B9\u03BD
    might have originally meant shovel. Similarly to the Latin use of pala (spade),
    a resemblance might be felt between the shape of a shovel and the shoulder blade.
    Alternatively, the shoulder blade might have been used originally for digging
    and shoveling.\n\n\n==== Shoulder blade ====\nShoulder blade is colloquial name
    for this bone. Shoulder is cognate to German and Dutch equivalents Schulter and
    schouder. There are a few etymological explanations for shoulder. The first supposes
    that shoulder can be literally translated as that which shields or protects,
    as its possibly related to Icelandic skioldr, shield and skyla, to cover, to
    defend. The second explanation relates shoulder to ancient Greek \u03C3\u03BA\u03AD\u03BB\u03BF\u03C2,
    leg. The latter spots the possible root skel-, meaning to bend, to curve. The
    third explanation links the root skel- to to cleave. This meaning could refer
    to the shape of the shoulder blade.\n\n\n== In other animals ==\n\nIn fish, the
    scapular blade is a structure attached to the upper surface of the articulation
    of the pectoral fin, and is accompanied by a similar coracoid plate on the lower
    surface. \n\nAlthough sturdy in cartilagenous fish, both plates are generally
    small in most other fish, and may be partially cartilagenous, or consist of multiple
    bony elements.\n\nIn the early tetrapods, these two structures respectively became
    the scapula and a bone referred to as the procoracoid (commonly called simply
    the \"coracoid\", but not homologous with the mammalian structure of that name).
    \n\nIn amphibians and reptiles (birds included), these two bones are distinct,
    but together form a single structure bearing many of the muscle attachments for
    the forelimb. \n\nIn such animals, the scapula is usually a relatively simple
    plate, lacking the projections and spine that it possesses in mammals. \n\nHowever,
    the detailed structure of these bones varies considerably in living groups. \n\nFor
    example, in frogs, the procoracoid bones may be braced together at the animal's
    underside to absorb the shock of landing, while in turtles, the combined structure
    forms a Y-shape in order to allow the scapula to retain a connection to the clavicle
    (which is part of the shell). \n\nIn birds, the procoracoids help to brace the
    wing against the top of the sternum.In the fossil therapsids, a third bone, the
    true coracoid, formed just behind the procoracoid. \n\nThe resulting three-boned
    structure is still seen in modern monotremes, but in all other living mammals,
    the procoracoid has disappeared, and the coracoid bone has fused with the scapula,
    to become the coracoid process. \n\nThese changes are associated with the upright
    gait of mammals, compared with the more sprawling limb arrangement of reptiles
    and amphibians; the muscles formerly attached to the procoracoid are no longer
    required. \n\nThe altered musculature is also responsible for the alteration
    in the shape of the rest of the scapula; the forward margin of the original bone
    became the spine and acromion, from which the main shelf of the shoulder blade
    arises as a new structure.\n\n\n=== In dinosaurs ===\n\nIn dinosaurs the main
    bones of the pectoral girdle were the scapula (shoulder blade) and the coracoid,
    both of which directly articulated with the clavicle. \n\nThe clavicle was present
    in saurischian dinosaurs but largely absent in ornithischian dinosaurs. \n\nThe
    place on the scapula where it articulated with the humerus (upper bone of the
    forelimb) is called the glenoid. \n\nThe scapula serves as the attachment site
    for a dinosaur's back and forelimb muscles.\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scapula"

  descriptionText: "\n\nRADIUS (BONE)\n\n\nThe radius or radial bone is one of the
    two large bones of the forearm, the other being the ulna. \n\nIt extends from
    the lateral side of the elbow to the thumb side of the wrist and runs parallel
    to the ulna. \n\nThe ulna is usually slightly longer than the radius, but the
    radius is thicker. \n\nTherefore the radius is considered to be the larger of
    the two.  \n\nIt is a long bone, prism-shaped and slightly curved longitudinally.\n\nThe
    radius is part of two joints: the elbow and the wrist. \n\nAt the elbow, it joins
    with the capitulum of the humerus, and in a separate region, with the ulna at
    the radial notch. At the wrist, the radius forms a joint with the ulna bone.\n\nThe
    corresponding bone in the lower leg is the fibula.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe
    long narrow medullary cavity is enclosed in a strong wall of compact bone. \n\nIt
    is thickest along the interosseous border and thinnest at the extremities, same
    over the cup-shaped articular surface (fovea) of the head.\n\nThe trabeculae
    of the spongy tissue are somewhat arched at the upper end and pass upward from
    the compact layer of the shaft to the fovea capituli (the humerus's cup-shaped
    articulatory notch); they are crossed by others parallel to the surface of the
    fovea. \n\nThe arrangement at the lower end is somewhat similar. \n\nIt is missing
    in radial aplasia.\nThe radius has a body and two extremities. \n\nThe upper
    extremity of the radius consists of a somewhat cylindrical head articulating
    with the ulna and the humerus, a neck, and a radial tuberosity. \n\nThe body
    of the radius is self-explanatory, and the lower extremity of the radius is roughly
    quadrilateral in shape, with articular surfaces for the ulna, scaphoid and lunate
    bones. \n\nThe distal end of the radius forms two palpable points, radially the
    styloid process and Lister's tubercle on the ulnar side. \n\nAlong with the proximal
    and distal radioulnar articulations, an interosseous membrane originates medially
    along the length of the body of the radius to attach the radius to the ulna.\n\n\n===
    Near the wrist ===\n\nThe distal end of the radius is large and of quadrilateral
    form.\n\n===Joint surfaces===\n\nIt is provided with two articular surfaces \u2013
    one below, for the carpus, and another at the medial side, for the ulna.\n\nThe
    carpal articular surface is triangular, concave, smooth, and divided by a slight
    antero-posterior ridge into two parts. \n\nOf these, the lateral, triangular,
    articulates with the scaphoid bone; the medial, quadrilateral, with the lunate
    bone.\n\nThe articular surface for the ulna is called the ulnar notch (sigmoid
    cavity) of the radius; it is narrow, concave, smooth, and articulates with the
    head of the ulna.\n\nThese two articular surfaces are separated by a prominent
    ridge, to which the base of the triangular articular disk is attached; this disk
    separates the wrist-joint from the distal radioulnar articulation.\n\nOther surfacesThis
    end of the bone has three non-articular surfaces \u2013 volar, dorsal, and lateral.\n\nThe
    volar surface, rough and irregular, affords attachment to the volar radiocarpal
    ligament.\nThe dorsal surface is convex, affords attachment to the dorsal radiocarpal
    ligament, and is marked by three grooves. Enumerated from the lateral side:\n\nThe
    first groove is broad, but shallow, and subdivided into two by a slight ridge:
    the lateral of these two, transmits the tendon of the extensor carpi radialis
    longus muscle; the medial, the tendon of the extensor carpi radialis brevis muscle.\n\nThe
    second is deep but narrow, and bounded laterally by a sharply defined ridge;
    it is directed obliquely from above downward and lateralward, and transmits the
    tendon of the extensor pollicis longus muscle.\n\nThe third is broad, for the
    passage of the tendons of the extensor indicis proprius and extensor digitorum
    communis.\n\nThe lateral surface is prolonged obliquely downward into a strong,
    conical projection, the styloid process, which gives attachment by its base to
    the tendon of the brachioradialis, and by its apex to the radial collateral ligament
    of wrist joint. \n\nThe lateral surface of this process is marked by a flat groove,
    for the tendons of the abductor pollicis longus muscle and extensor pollicis
    brevis muscle.\n\n\n=== Body ===\n\nThe body of the radius (or shaft of radius)
    is prismoid in form, narrower above than below, and slightly curved, so as to
    be convex lateralward. \n\nIt presents three borders and three surfaces.\n\n===Borders===\n\nThe
    volar border (margo volaris; anterior border; palmar;) extends from the lower
    part of the tuberosity above to the anterior part of the base of the styloid
    process below, and separates the volar from the lateral surface. \n\nIts upper
    third is prominent, and from its oblique direction has received the name of the
    oblique line of the radius; it gives origin to the flexor digitorum superficialis
    muscle (also flexor digitorum sublimis) and flexor pollicis longus muscle; the
    surface above the line gives insertion to part of the supinator muscle. \n\nThe
    middle third of the volar border is indistinct and rounded. \n\nThe lower fourth
    is prominent, and gives insertion to the pronator quadratus muscle, and attachment
    to the dorsal carpal ligament; it ends in a small tubercle, into which the tendon
    of the brachioradialis muscle is inserted.\n\nThe dorsal border (margo dorsalis;
    posterior border) begins above at the back of the neck, and ends below at the
    posterior part of the base of the styloid process; it separates the posterior
    from the lateral surface.  is indistinct above and below, but well-marked in
    the middle third of the bone.\n\nThe interosseous border (internal border; crista
    interossea; interosseous crest;) begins above, at the back part of the tuberosity,
    and its upper part is rounded and indistinct; it becomes sharp and prominent
    as it descends, and at its lower part divides into two ridges which are continued
    to the anterior and posterior margins of the ulnar notch. \n\nTo the posterior
    of the two ridges the lower part of the interosseous membrane is attached, while
    the triangular surface between the ridges gives insertion to part of the pronator
    quadratus muscle. \n\nThis crest separates the volar from the dorsal surface,
    and gives attachment to the interosseous membrane.  \n\nThe connection between
    the two bones is actually a joint referred to as a syndesmosis joint.\n\n===Surfaces===\n\nThe
    volar surface (facies volaris; anterior surface) is concave in its upper three-fourths,
    and gives origin to the flexor pollicis longus muscle; it is broad and flat in
    its lower fourth, and affords insertion to the Pronator quadratus. \n\nA prominent
    ridge limits the insertion of the Pronator quadratus below, and between this
    and the inferior border is a triangular rough surface for the attachment of the
    volar radiocarpal ligament. \n\nAt the junction of the upper and middle thirds
    of the volar surface is the nutrient foramen, which is directed obliquely upward.\n\nThe
    dorsal surface (facies dorsalis; posterior surface) is convex, and smooth in
    the upper third of its extent, and covered by the Supinator. \n\nIts middle third
    is broad, slightly concave, and gives origin to the Abductor pollicis longus
    above, and the extensor pollicis brevis muscle below. \n\nIts lower third is
    broad, convex, and covered by the tendons of the muscles which subsequently run
    in the grooves on the lower end of the bone.\n\nThe lateral surface (facies lateralis;
    external surface) is convex throughout its entire extent and is known as the
    convexity of the radius, curving outwards to be convex at the side. \n\nIts upper
    third gives insertion to the supinator muscle. About its center is a rough ridge,
    for the insertion of the pronator teres muscle. \n\nIts lower part is narrow,
    and covered by the tendons of the abductor pollicis longus muscle and extensor
    pollicis brevis muscle.\n\n\n=== Near the elbow ===\n\nThe upper extremity of
    the radius (or proximal extremity) presents a head, neck, and tuberosity.\n\nThe
    radial head has a cylindrical form, and on its upper surface is a shallow cup
    or fovea for articulation with the capitulum (or capitellum) of the humerus.
    \n\nThe circumference of the head is smooth; it is broad medially where it articulates
    with the radial notch of the ulna, narrow in the rest of its extent, which is
    embraced by the annular ligament. \n\nThe deepest point in the fovea is not axi-symmetric
    with the long axis of the radius, creating a cam effect during pronation and
    supination.\n\nThe head is supported on a round, smooth, and constricted portion
    called the neck, on the back of which is a slight ridge for the insertion of
    part of the supinator muscle.\n\nBeneath the neck, on the medial side, is an
    eminence, the radial tuberosity; its surface is divided into a posterior, rough
    portion, for the insertion of the tendon of the biceps brachii muscle, and an
    anterior, smooth portion, on which a bursa is interposed between the tendon and
    the bone.\n\n\n=== Development ===\n\nThe radius is ossified from three centers:
    one for the body, and one for each extremity. \n\nThat for the body makes its
    appearance near the center of the bone, during the eighth week of fetal life.\n\nOssification
    commences in the lower end between 9 and 26 months of age. \n\nThe ossification
    center for the upper end appears by the fifth year.\n\nThe upper epiphysis fuses
    with the body at the age of seventeen or eighteen years, the lower about the
    age of twenty.\n\nAn additional center sometimes found in the radial tuberosity,
    appears about the fourteenth or fifteenth year.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\n=== Muscle
    attachments ===\n\nThe biceps muscle inserts on the radial tuberosity of the
    upper extremity of the bone. \n\nThe upper third of the body of the bone attaches
    to the supinator, the flexor digitorum superficialis, and the flexor pollicis
    longus muscles.\n\nThe middle third of the body attaches to the extensor ossis
    metacarpi pollicis, extensor primi internodii pollicis, and the pronator teres
    muscles.\n\nThe lower quarter of the body attaches to the pronator quadratus
    muscle and the tendon of the supinator longus.\n\n\n== Clinical significance
    ==\n\nRadial aplasia refers to the congenital absence or shortness of the radius.\n\n\n===
    Fracture ===\n\nSpecific fracture types of the radius include:\n\n-Proximal radius
    fracture. \n\n-A fracture within the capsule of the elbow joint results in the
    fat pad sign or \"sail sign\" which is a displacement of the fat pad at the elbow.\n\n-Essex-Lopresti
    fracture \u2013 a fracture of the radial head with concomitant dislocation of
    the distal radio-ulnar joint with disruption of the interosseous membrane.\n\n-Radial
    shaft fracture\n\n-Distal radius fracture\n\n-Galeazzi fracture \u2013 a fracture
    of the radius with dislocation of the distal radioulnar joint\n\n-Colles' fracture
    \u2013 a distal fracture of the radius with dorsal (posterior) displacement of
    the wrist and hand\n\n-Smith's fracture \u2013 a distal fracture of the radius
    with volar (ventral) displacement of the wrist and hand\n\n-Barton's fracture
    \u2013 an intra-articular fracture of the distal radius with dislocation of the
    radiocarpal joint.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe word radius is Latin for \"ray\".
    \n\nIn the context of the radius bone, a ray can be thought of rotating around
    an axis line extending diagonally from center of capitulum to the center of distal
    ulna. \n\nWhile the ulna is the major contributor to the elbow joint, the radius
    primarily contributes to the wrist joint.\n\nThe radius is named so because the
    radius (bone) acts like the radius (of a circle). \n\nIt rotates around the ulna
    and the far end (where it joins to the bones of the hand), known as the styloid
    process of the radius, is the distance from the ulna (center of the circle) to
    the edge of the radius (the circle).  \n\nThe ulna acts as the center point to
    the circle because when the arm is rotated the ulna does not move.\n\n\n== Animals
    ==\n\nIn four-legged animals, the radius is the main load-bearing bone of the
    lower forelimb. \n\nIts structure is similar in most terrestrial tetrapods, but
    it may be fused with the ulna in some mammals (such as horses) and reduced or
    modified in animals with flippers or vestigial forelimbs.\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radius_(bone)"

  descriptionText: "\n\nPISIFORM BONE\n\n\nThe pisiform bone ( or ), also spelled
    pisiforme (from the Latin pisifomis, pea-shaped), is a small knobbly, sesamoid
    bone that is found in the wrist. \n\nIt forms the ulnar border of the carpal
    tunnel.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe pisiform is a sesamoid bone, with no covering
    membrane of periosteum. \n\nIt is the last carpal bone to ossify. \n\nThe pisiform
    bone is a small bone found in the proximal row of the wrist (carpus). \n\nIt
    is situated where the ulna joins the wrist, within the tendon of the flexor carpi
    ulnaris muscle.\n\nIt only has one side that acts as a joint, articulating with
    the triquetral bone. \n\nIt is on a plane anterior to the other carpal bones
    and is spheroidal in form.\nThe pisiform bone has four surfaces:\n\nThe dorsal
    surface is smooth and oval, and articulates with the triquetral: this facet approaches
    the superior, but not the inferior border of the bone.\n\nThe palmar surface
    is rounded and rough, and gives attachment to the transverse carpal ligament,
    the flexor carpi ulnaris and the abductor digiti quinti.\n\nThe lateral surface
    is rough, and concave.\n\nThe medial surface' is rough and usually convex.\n\n\n==
    Etymology ==\n\nThe etymology derives from the Latin p\u012Bsum which means \"pea\"
    ultimately derived from the Greek \"pison\" (pea).\n\n\n== Function ==\n\nThe
    pisiform bone is most recognizable as an unassuming palmar projection forming
    the heel of your hand.\n\nThe pisiform bone, along with the hamulus of the hamate,
    defines the medial boundary of the carpal tunnel because the pisiform body acts
    as one of the four attachments points of the flexor retinaculum. \n\nIt also
    acts as an attachment site for tendons of the abductor digiti minimi and for
    the flexor carpi ulnaris - the tendon in which it develops. \n\nThe pisiform
    is the only carpal bone with insertions and attachments for the abductor digiti
    minimi and the flexor carpi ulnaris. \n\nIt is suggested that due to the pisiform's
    surprisingly large range of movement along its articulation surface with the
    triquetral bone (about 1 cm of movement is allowed), contraction of the flexor
    carpi ulnaris is necessary for the pisiform to remain stable enough for the abductor
    digiti minimi to function effectively.\n\nIn clinical studies, the pisiform has
    been removed as treatment for osteoarthritis in the pisotriquetral joint. \n\nWhile
    some studies came to the conclusion that the pisiform \"contributes to the stability
    of the ulnar column of the wrist\", others suggested that while excision slightly
    impairs the range of motion of the wrist (especially wrist extension), the forces
    generated within the wrist are not significantly impacted. \n\nSubjects in the
    latter study did report impaired function after excision when performing heavy
    lifting and weightbearing activities, but this is suggested to be subjective
    considering that they did not have to change occupation or their level of activity
    as a result of the excision.\n\n\n== Development ==\n\nCompared with other non-human
    primates, humans have a short pisiform bone. \n\nThis dramatic size difference
    is suggested to be the outcome of a lost growth plate in hominins some time between
    Australopithecus afarensis, who has been shown to have an elongated and ape-like
    pisiform, and Homo neanderthalensis, who is suggested to have a pisiform resembling
    the modern human condition.\n\nIt is suggested that the first signs of human
    pisiform ossification, observed between the ages of 7 and 12, corresponds to
    the period of secondary pisiform ossification in apes. \n\nThis can point to
    a couple different changes in development: either this growth plate loss in humans
    is also accompanied by a developmental shift in the timing of pisiform formation,
    or it is the primary center that fails to form in humans and as a result our
    pisiform is homologous to the epiphysis of other mammalian pisiforms.\n\nStudies
    looking at the effect of Hox gene knockouts on the formation of the pisiform
    in mice have suggested that the modification of Hoxa11 or Hoxd11 genes, or the
    downstream targets they affect, could have acted as the mechanism for the reduction
    we see in the human pisiform condition.\n\n\n== Evolution ==\n\nThere are several
    hypotheses that seek to explain why we see pisiform reduction during the course
    of hominin evolution. \n\nSome suggest that the reduction of the pisiform allowed
    for ulnar deviation and that allowed for greater extension in the human wrist
    which increased our capacity for throwing. \n\nScholars with this point of view
    would believe that these anatomical changes would improve the action of clubbing
    in our hominin ancestors.\nOthers suggest that the pisiform's link with Hoxa11
    and Hoxd11 could tie its developmental history to that of the forearm, whose
    length is determined by Hox gene expression. \n\nWithin the context of this hypothesis,
    because modern forearm proportions are not seen until Homo erectus at 1.5 million
    years ago, it is possible that pisiform reduction would have also occurred around
    this time. \n\nAlternatively, the same group suggests that the reduction could
    be a reflection of independent selection associated with the production and use
    of stone tools, but changes in pisiform morphology have yet to be studied in
    relation to their effect on wrist function.\n\n\n== Other animals ==\n\nAll other
    tetrapods have a pisiform, being the most common sesamoid. \n\nIn mammals and
    non-human primates, the pisiform is an enlarged and elongated bone that articulates
    with the distal ulna. \n\nIn some taxa, the pisiform even articulates with the
    hammate or radius. \n\nIn these non-human taxa, the pisiform develops from two
    ossification centers that are divided by a palmar epiphyseal plate. \n\nBecause
    in other mammals, the bone does not follow a typical sesamoid development pattern
    and can be seen articulating with more than one bone, the pisiform is not a true
    sesamoid bone.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pisiform_bone"

  descriptionText: "\n\nPALATINE BONE\n\n\nIn anatomy, the palatine bones () are
    two irregular bones of the facial skeleton in many animal species, located above
    the uvula in the throat. \n\nTogether with the maxillae, they comprise the hard
    palate. (Palate is derived from the Latin palatum.)\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe
    palatine bones are situated at the back of the nasal cavity between the maxilla
    and the pterygoid process of the sphenoid bone.\nThey contribute to the walls
    of three cavities: the floor and lateral walls of the nasal cavity, the roof
    of the mouth, and the floor of the orbits. \n\nThey help to form the pterygopalatine
    and pterygoid fossae, and the inferior orbital fissures.\nEach palatine bone
    somewhat resembles the letter L, and consists of a horizontal plate, a perpendicular
    plate, and three projecting processes \u2014 the pyramidal process, which is
    directed backward and lateral from the junction of the two parts, and the orbital
    and sphenoidal processes, which surmount the vertical part, and are separated
    by a deep notch, the sphenopalatine notch. \n\nThe two plates form the posterior
    part of the hard palate and the floor of the nasal cavity; anteriorly, they join
    with the maxillae. \n\nThe two horizontal plates articulate with each other at
    the posterior part of the median palatine suture and more anteriorly with the
    maxillae at the transverse palatine suture.The human palatine articulates with
    six bones: the sphenoid, ethmoid, maxilla, inferior nasal concha, vomer and opposite
    palatine.\nThere are two important foramina in the palatine bones that transmit
    nerves and blood vessels to this region: the greater and lesser palatine. \n\nThe
    larger greater palatine foramen is located in the posterolateral region of each
    of the palatine bones, usually at the apex of the maxillary third molar. \n\nThe
    greater palatine foramen transmits the greater palatine nerve and blood vessels.
    \n\nA smaller opening nearby, the lesser palatine foramen, transmits the lesser
    palatine nerve and blood vessels to the soft palate and tonsils. \n\nBoth foramina
    are openings of the pterygopalatine canal that carries the descending palatine
    nerves and blood vessels from the pterygopalatine fossa to the palate.\n\n\n==
    Function ==\n\nThe sphenopalatine foramen is the opening between the sphenoid
    bone and orbital processes of the palatine bone; it opens into the nasal cavity
    and gives passage to branches from the pterygopalatine ganglion and the sphenopalatine
    artery from the maxillary artery.\n\n\n== Other animals ==\n\nIn bony fish the
    palatine bone consists of the perpendicular plate only, lying on the inner edge
    of the maxilla. \n\nThe lower surface of the bone may bear several teeth, forming
    a second row behind those of the maxilla; in many cases, these are actually larger
    than the maxillary teeth. \n\nAlthough a similar pattern was present in primitive
    tetrapods, the palatine bone is reduced in most living amphibians, forming, in
    frogs and salamanders, only a narrow bar between the vomer and maxilla.Early
    fossil reptiles retained the arrangement seen in more primitive vertebrates,
    but in mammals, the lower surface of the palatine became folded over during evolution,
    forming the horizontal plate, and meeting in the midline of the mouth. \n\nThis
    forms the rear of the hard palate, separating the oral and nasal cavities, and
    making it easier to breathe while eating. \n\nA parallel development has occurred
    to varying degrees in many living reptiles, reaching its greatest extent in crocodilians.
    \n\nIn birds, the palatine bones remain separate, long the sides of the rear
    part of the upper jaw, and typically have a mobile articulation with the cranium.There
    are numerous variations amongst mammals, amphibians and other species. \n\nFor
    example, the palatine bone in many amphibians such as the rough-skinned newt
    manifests as a distinct V-shaped structure. \n\nIn the case of cat species, the
    horizontal and a vertical elements join at a forty five degree angle.\n\n\n==

  descriptionText: "\n\nSEVENTH RIB\n\n\n== Structure of the rib cage ==\n\nRibs
    are described based on their location and connection with the sternum. \n\nAll
    ribs are attached posteriorly to the thoracic vertebrae and are numbered accordingly
    one to twelve. \n\nRibs that articulate directly with the sternum are called
    true ribs, whereas those that do not articulate directly are termed false ribs.
    \n\n\n=== Attachment of the rib cage ===\n\nThe terms true ribs and false ribs
    describe rib pairs that are directly or indirectly attached to the sternum. \n\nThe
    first seven rib pairs known as the fixed or vertebrosternal ribs are the true
    ribs (Latin: costae verae) as they connect directly to the sternum; the next
    five pairs (eighth to twelfth) are the false ribs (Latin: costae spuriae). \n\n\n===
    Parts of rib (general) ===\n\nEach rib consists of a head, neck, and a shaft.
    \n\nAll ribs are attached posteriorly to the thoracic vertebrae. \n\nThey are
    numbered to match the vertebrae they attach to \u2013 one to twelve, from top
    (T1) to bottom. \n\nThe head of the rib is the end part closest to the vertebra
    with which it articulates. \n\nIt is marked by a kidney-shaped articular surface
    which is divided by a horizontal crest into two articulating regions. \n\nThe
    upper region articulates with the inferior costal facet on the vertebra above,
    and the larger region articulates with the superior costal facet on the vertebra
    with the same number. \n\nThe transverse process of a thoracic vertebra also
    articulates at the transverse costal facet with the tubercle of the rib of the
    same number. \n\nThe crest gives attachment to the intra-articular ligament.The
    neck of the rib is the flattened part that extends laterally from the head. \n\nThe
    neck is about 3 cm long. \n\nIts anterior surface is flat and smooth, whilst
    its posterior is perforated by numerous foramina and its surface rough, to give
    attachment to the ligament of the neck. \n\nIts upper border presents a rough
    crest (crista colli costae) for the attachment of the anterior costotransverse
    ligament; its lower border is rounded.\n\nOn the posterior surface at the neck,
    is an eminence\u2014the tubercle that consists of an articular and a non-articular
    portion. \n\nThe articular portion is the lower and more medial of the two and
    presents a small, oval surface for articulation with the transverse costal facet
    on the end of the transverse process of the lower of the two vertebrae to which
    the head is connected. \n\nThe non-articular portion is a rough elevation and
    affords attachment to the ligament of the tubercle. \n\nThe tubercle is much
    more prominent in the upper ribs than in the lower ribs.\n\nThe angle of a rib
    (costal angle) may both refer to the bending part of it, and a prominent line
    in this area, a little in front of the tubercle. \n\nThis line is directed downward
    and laterally; this gives attachment to a tendon of the iliocostalis muscle.
    \n\nAt this point, the rib is bent in two directions, and at the same time twisted
    on its long axis.\n\nThe distance between the angle and the tubercle is progressively
    greater from the second to the tenth ribs. \n\nThe area between the angle and
    the tubercle is rounded, rough, and irregular, and serves for the attachment
    of the longissimus dorsi muscle.\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rib_cage"

  descriptionText: "\n\nFIBULA\n\n\nThe fibula or calf bone is a leg bone on the
    lateral side of the tibia, to which it is connected above and below. \n\nIt is
    the smaller of the two bones and, in proportion to its length, the most slender
    of all the long bones. \n\nIts upper extremity is small, placed toward the back
    of the head of the tibia, below the knee joint and excluded from the formation
    of this joint. \n\nIts lower extremity inclines a little forward, so as to be
    on a plane anterior to that of the upper end; it projects below the tibia and
    forms the lateral part of the ankle joint.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe bone has
    the following components:\n\n-Lateral malleolus\n-Interosseous membrane connecting
    the fibula to the tibia, forming a syndesmosis joint\n-The superior tibiofibular
    articulation is an arthrodial joint between the lateral condyle of the tibia
    and the head of the fibula.\n-The inferior tibiofibular articulation (tibiofibular
    syndesmosis) is formed by the rough, convex surface of the medial side of the
    lower end of the fibula, and a rough concave surface on the lateral side of the
    tibia.\n\n\n=== Blood supply ===\n\nThe blood supply is important for planning
    free tissue transfer because the fibula is commonly used to reconstruct the mandible. 
    \n\nThe shaft is supplied in its middle third by a large nutrient vessel from
    the fibular artery.  \n\nIt is also perfused from its periosteum which receives
    many small branches from the fibular artery.  \n\nThe proximal head and the epiphysis
    are supplied by a branch of the anterior tibial artery.  \n\nIn harvesting the
    bone the middle third is always taken and the ends preserved (4 cm  proximally
    and 6 cm  distally)\n\n\n=== Development ===\n\nThe fibula is ossified from three
    centers, one for the shaft, and one for either end. \n\nOssification begins in
    the body about the eighth week of fetal life, and extends toward the extremities.
    At birth the ends are cartilaginous.\n\nOssification commences in the lower end
    in the second year, and in the upper about the fourth year. The lower epiphysis,
    the first to ossify, unites with the body about the twentieth year; the upper
    epiphysis joins about the twenty-fifth year.\n\n\n=== Head ===\n\nThe upper extremity
    or head of the fibula is of an irregular quadrate form, presenting above a flattened
    articular surface, directed upward, forward, and medialward, for articulation
    with a corresponding surface on the lateral condyle of the tibia. \n\nOn the
    lateral side is a thick and rough prominence continued behind into a pointed
    eminence, the apex (styloid process), which projects upward from the posterior
    part of the head.\n\nThe prominence, at its upper and lateral part, gives attachment
    to the tendon of the biceps femoris and to the fibular collateral ligament of
    the knee-joint, the ligament dividing the tendon into two parts.\n\nThe remaining
    part of the circumference of the head is rough, for the attachment of muscles
    and ligaments. \n\nIt presents in front a tubercle for the origin of the upper
    and anterior fibers of the peroneus longus, and a surface for the attachment
    of the anterior ligament of the head; and behind, another tubercle, for the attachment
    of the posterior ligament of the head and the origin of the upper fibers of the
    soleus.\n\n\n=== Body ===\n\nThe body of the fibula presents four borders - the
    antero-lateral, the antero-medial, the postero-lateral, and the postero-medial;
    and four surfaces - anterior, posterior, medial, and lateral.\n\n==Borders==\n\nThe
    antero-lateral border begins above in front of the head, runs vertically downward
    to a little below the middle of the bone, and then curving somewhat lateralward,
    bifurcates so as to embrace a triangular subcutaneous surface immediately above
    the lateral malleolus. \n\nThis border gives attachment to an intermuscular septum,
    which separates the extensor muscles on the anterior surface of the leg from
    the peronaei longus and brevis on the lateral surface.\n\nThe antero-medial border,
    or interosseous crest, is situated close to the medial side of the preceding,
    and runs nearly parallel with it in the upper third of its extent, but diverges
    from it in the lower two-thirds. \n\nIt begins above just beneath the head of
    the bone (sometimes it is quite indistinct for about 2.5 cm. below the head),
    and ends at the apex of a rough triangular surface immediately above the articular
    facet of the lateral malleolus. \n\nIt serves for the attachment of the interosseous
    membrane, which separates the extensor muscles in front from the flexor muscles
    behind.\n\nThe postero-lateral border is prominent; it begins above at the apex,
    and ends below in the posterior border of the lateral malleolus. \n\nIt is directed
    lateralward above, backward in the middle of its course, backward, and a little
    medialward below, and gives attachment to an aponeurosis which separates the
    peronaei on the lateral surface from the flexor muscles on the posterior surface.\n\nThe
    postero-medial border, sometimes called the oblique line, begins above at the
    medial side of the head, and ends by becoming continuous with the interosseous
    crest at the lower fourth of the bone. \n\nIt is well-marked and prominent at
    the upper and middle parts of the bone. \n\nIt gives attachment to an aponeurosis
    which separates the tibialis posterior from the soleus and flexor hallucis longus.\n\n===Surfaces===\n\nThe
    anterior surface is the interval between the antero-lateral and antero-medial
    borders. \n\nIt is extremely narrow and flat in the upper third of its extent;
    broader and grooved longitudinally in its lower third; it serves for the origin
    of three muscles: the extensor digitorum longus, extensor hallucis longus, and
    peroneus tertius.\n\nThe posterior surface is the space included between the
    postero-lateral and the postero-medial borders; it is continuous below with the
    triangular area above the articular surface of the lateral malleolus; it is directed
    backward above, backward and medialward at its middle, directly medialward below.
    \n\nIts upper third is rough, for the origin of the soleus; its lower part presents
    a triangular surface, connected to the tibia by a strong interosseous ligament;
    the intervening part of the surface is covered by the fibers of origin of the
    flexor hallucis longus. \n\nNear the middle of this surface is the nutrient foramen,
    which is directed downward.\n\nThe medial surface is the interval included between
    the antero-medial and the postero-medial borders. \n\nIt is grooved for the origin
    of the tibialis posterior.\n\nThe lateral surface is the space between the antero-lateral
    and postero-lateral borders. \n\nIt is broad, and often deeply grooved; it is
    directed lateralward in the upper two-thirds of its course, backward in the lower
    third, where it is continuous with the posterior border of the lateral malleolus.
    \n\nThis surface gives origin to the peronaei longus and brevis.\n\n== Function
    ==\n\nThe fibula does not carry any significant load (weight) of the body. \n\nIt
    extends past the lower end of the tibia and forms the outer part of the ankle
    providing stability to this joint. \n\nIt has grooves for certain ligaments which
    gives them leverage and multiplies the muscle force. \n\nIt provides attachment
    points for the following muscles:\n\n\n== Clinical significance ==\n\n\n=== Fractures
    ===\n\nThe most common type of fibula fracture is located at the distal end of
    the bone, and is classified as ankle fracture. In the Danis\u2013Weber classification
    it has three categories:\n\n-Type A: Fracture of the lateral malleolus, distal
    to the syndesmosis (the connection between the distal ends of the tibia and fibula).\n-Type
    B: Fracture of the fibula at the level of the syndesmosis\n-Type C: Fracture
    of the fibula proximal to the syndesmosis.\n\nA Maisonneuve fracture is a spiral
    fracture of the proximal third of the fibula associated with a tear of the distal
    tibiofibular syndesmosis and the interosseous membrane. There is an associated
    fracture of the medial malleolus or rupture of the deep deltoid ligament.\n\nAn
    avulsion fracture of the head of the fibula refers to the fracture of the fibular
    head because of a sudden contraction of the biceps femoris muscle that pulls
    its site of attachment on the bone. \n\nThe attachment of the biceps femoris
    tendon on the fibular head is closely related to the lateral collateral ligament
    of the knee. \n\nTherefore, this ligament is prone to injury in this type of
    avulsion fracture.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Etymology ===\n\nThe word fibula
    can be dated back to c. 1670 to describe a clasp or brooch \u2013 see fibula
    (brooch) \u2013 and was first used in English for the smaller bone in the lower
    leg c. 1706. It derives from Latin f\u012Bbula, also meaning a clasp or brooch.
    \n\nThe bone was so called because it resembles a clasp like a modern safety
    pin.The adjective peroneal referring to the fibula bone or its surrounding structures
    derives from \u03C0\u03B5\u03C1\u03CC\u03BD\u03B7 : per\xF3n\u0113, the Ancient
    Greek word for a clasp.\n\n\n== Other animals ==\n\nBecause the fibula bears
    relatively little weight in comparison with the tibia, it is typically narrower
    in all but the most primitive tetrapods. \n\nIn many animals, it still articulates
    with the posterior part of the lower extremity of the femur, but this feature
    is frequently lost (as it is in humans). \n\nIn some animals, the reduction of
    the fibula has proceeded even further than it has in humans, with the loss of
    the tarsal articulation, and, in extreme cases (such as the horse), partial fusion
    with the tibia.\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibula"

  descriptionText: "\n\nSCAPULA\n\n\nIn anatomy, the scapula (plural scapulae or
    scapulas), also known as the shoulder bone, shoulder blade, wing bone, speal
    bone or blade bone, is the bone that connects the humerus (upper arm bone) with
    the clavicle (collar bone). \n\nLike their connected bones, the scapulae are
    paired, with each scapula on either side of the body being roughly a mirror image
    of the other. \n\nThe name derives from the Classical Latin word for trowel or
    small shovel, which it was thought to resemble.\n\nIn compound terms, the prefix
    omo- is used for the shoulder blade in medical terminology. \n\nThis prefix is
    derived from \u1F66\u03BC\u03BF\u03C2 (\u014Dmos), the Ancient Greek word for
    shoulder, and is cognate with the Latin (h)umerus, which in Latin signifies either
    the shoulder or the upper arm bone.\n\nThe scapula forms the back of the shoulder
    girdle. In humans, it is a flat bone, roughly triangular in shape, placed on
    a posterolateral aspect of the thoracic cage.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe scapula
    is a wide, flat bone lying on the thoracic wall that provides an attachment for
    three groups of muscles: intrinsic, extrinsic, and stabilising and rotating muscles.
    \n\nThe intrinsic muscles of the scapula include the muscles of the rotator cuff\u2014the
    subscapularis, teres minor, supraspinatus, and infraspinatus. \n\nThese muscles
    attach to the surface of the scapula and are responsible for the internal and
    external rotation of the shoulder joint, along with humeral abduction.\n\nThe
    extrinsic muscles include the biceps, triceps, and deltoid muscles and attach
    to the coracoid process and supraglenoid tubercle of the scapula, infraglenoid
    tubercle of the scapula, and spine of the scapula. \n\nThese muscles are responsible
    for several actions of the glenohumeral joint.\n\nThe third group, which is mainly
    responsible for stabilization and rotation of the scapula, consists of the trapezius,
    serratus anterior, levator scapulae, and rhomboid muscles. \n\nThese attach to
    the medial, superior, and inferior borders of the scapula.\n\nThe head, processes,
    and the thickened parts of the bone contain cancellous tissue; the rest consists
    of a thin layer of compact tissue.\n\nThe central part of the supraspinatus fossa
    and the upper part of the infraspinatous fossa, but especially the former, are
    usually so thin in humans as to be semitransparent; occasionally the bone is
    found wanting in this situation, and the adjacent muscles are separated only
    by fibrous tissue. \n\nThe scapula has two surfaces, three borders, three angles,
    and three processes.\n\n\n=== Surfaces ===\n\n===Front or subscapular fossa===\n\nThe
    front of the scapula (also known as the costal or ventral surface) has a broad
    concavity called the subscapular fossa, to which the subscapularis muscle attaches.
    \n\nThe medial two-thirds of the fossa have 3 longitudinal oblique ridges, and
    another thick ridge adjoins the lateral border; they run outward and upward.
    \n\nThe ridges give attachment to the tendinous insertions, and the surfaces
    between them to the fleshy fibers, of the subscapularis muscle. \n\nThe lateral
    third of the fossa is smooth and covered by the fibers of this muscle.\n\nAt
    the upper part of the fossa is a transverse depression, where the bone appears
    to be bent on itself along a line at right angles to and passing through the
    center of the glenoid cavity, forming a considerable angle, called the subscapular
    angle; this gives greater strength to the body of the bone by its arched form,
    while the summit of the arch serves to support the spine and acromion.\n\nThe
    costal surface superior of the scapula is the origin of 1st digitation for the
    serratus anterior origin.\n\n===Back===\n\nThe back of the scapula (also called
    the dorsal or posterior surface) is arched from above downward, and is subdivided
    into two unequal parts by the spine of the scapula. \n\nThe portion above the
    spine is called the supraspinous fossa, and that below it the infraspinous fossa.
    \n\nThe two fossae are connected by the spinoglenoid notch, situated lateral
    to the root of the spine.\n\nThe supraspinous fossa, above the spine of scapula,
    is concave, smooth, and broader at its vertebral than at its humeral end; its
    medial two-thirds give origin to the Supraspinatus. \n\nAt its lateral surface
    resides the spinoglenoid fossa which is situated by the medial margin of the
    glenoid. \n\nThe spinoglenoid fossa houses the suprascpular canal which forms
    a connecting passage between the suprascapular notch and the spinoglenoid notch
    conveying the suprascapular nerve and vessels.\n\nThe infraspinous fossa is much
    larger than the preceding; toward its vertebral margin a shallow concavity is
    seen at its upper part; its center presents a prominent convexity, while near
    the axillary border is a deep groove which runs from the upper toward the lower
    part. \n\nThe medial two-thirds of the fossa give origin to the Infraspinatus;
    the lateral third is covered by this muscle.\n\nThere is a ridge on the outer
    part of the back of the scapula. This runs from the lower part of the glenoid
    cavity, downward and backward to the vertebral border, about 2.5 cm above the
    inferior angle. \n\nAttached to the ridge is a fibrous septum, which separates
    the infraspinatus muscle from the Teres major and Teres minor muscles. \n\nThe
    upper two-thirds of the surface between the ridge and the axillary border is
    narrow, and is crossed near its center by a groove for the scapular circumflex
    vessels; the Teres minor attaches here.\n\nThe broad and narrow portions above
    alluded to are separated by an oblique line, which runs from the axillary border,
    downward and backward, to meet the elevated ridge: \n    to it is attached a
    fibrous septum which separates the Teres muscles from each other.\n\nIts lower
    third presents a broader, somewhat triangular surface, the inferior angle of
    the scapula, which gives origin to the Teres major, and over which the Latissimus
    dorsi glides; frequently the latter muscle takes origin by a few fibers from
    this part.\n\n===Side===\n\nThe acromion forms the summit of the shoulder, and
    is a large, somewhat triangular or oblong process, flattened from behind forward,
    projecting at first laterally, and then curving forward and upward, so as to
    overhang the glenoid cavity.\n\n\n=== Angles ===\n\nThere are 3 angles:\n\n   
    -The superior angle of the scapula or medial angle, is covered by the trapezius
    muscle. \n\nThis angle is formed by the junction of the superior and medial borders
    of the scapula. \n\nThe superior angle is located at the approximate level of
    the second thoracic vertebra. \n\nThe superior angle of the scapula is thin,
    smooth, rounded, and inclined somewhat lateralward, and gives attachment to a
    few fibers of the levator scapulae muscle.\n\n    -The inferior angle of the
    scapula is the lowest part of the scapula and is covered by the latissimus dorsi
    muscle. \n\nIt moves forwards round the chest when the arm is abducted. \n\nThe
    inferior angle is formed by the union of the medial and lateral borders of the
    scapula. \n\nIt is thick and rough and its posterior or back surface affords
    attachment to the teres major and often to a few fibers of the latissimus dorsi.
    \n\nThe anatomical plane that passes vertically through the inferior angle is
    named the scapular line.\n\n    -The lateral angle of the scapula or glenoid
    angle also known as the head of the scapula is the thickest part of the scapula.
    \n    \nIt is broad and bears the glenoid cavity on its articular surface which
    is directed forward, laterally and slightly upwards, and articulates with the
    head of the humerus. \n\nThe inferior angle is broader below than above and its
    vertical diameter is the longest. \n\nThe surface is covered with cartilage in
    the fresh state; and its margins, slightly raised, give attachment to a fibrocartilaginous
    structure, the glenoidal labrum, which deepens the cavity. \n\nAt its apex is
    a slight elevation, the supraglenoid tuberosity, to which the long head of the
    biceps brachii is attached.\n\nThe anatomic neck of the scapula is the slightly
    constricted portion which surrounds the head and is more distinct below and behind
    than above and in front. \n\nThe surgical neck of the scapula passes directly
    medial to the base of the coracoid process.\n\n\n=== Borders ===\n\nThere are
    three borders of the scapula:\n\n    -The superior border is the shortest and
    thinnest; it is concave, and extends from the superior angle to the base of the
    coracoid process. \n\nIt is referred to as the cranial border in animals.\n\nAt
    its lateral part is a deep, semicircular notch, the scapular notch, formed partly
    by the base of the coracoid process. \n\nThis notch is converted into a foramen
    by the superior transverse scapular ligament, and serves for the passage of the
    suprascapular nerve; sometimes the ligament is ossified.\n\nThe adjacent part
    of the superior border affords attachment to the omohyoideus.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n   
    -The axillary border (or \"lateral border\") is the thickest of the three. \n   
    \nIt begins above at the lower margin of the glenoid cavity, and inclines obliquely
    downward and backward to the inferior angle. \n\nIt is referred to as the caudal
    border in animals.\n\nIt begins above at the lower margin of the glenoid cavity,
    and inclines obliquely downward and backward to the inferior angle.\n\nImmediately
    below the glenoid cavity is a rough impression, the infraglenoid tuberosity,
    about 2.5 cm (1 in). in length, which gives origin to the long head of the triceps
    brachii; in front of this is a longitudinal groove, which extends as far as the
    lower third of this border, and affords origin to part of the subscapularis.\n\nThe
    inferior third is thin and sharp, and serves for the attachment of a few fibers
    of the teres major behind, and of the subscapularis in front.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n   
    -The medial border (also called the vertebral border or medial margin) is the
    longest of the three borders, and extends from the superior angle to the inferior
    angle. \n\nIn animals it is referred to as the dorsal border.Four muscles attach
    to the medial border. Serratus anterior has a long attachment on the anterior
    lip. \n\nThree muscles insert along the posterior lip: \n    the levator scapulae
    (uppermost), rhomboid minor (middle), and to the rhomboid major (lower middle).\t\t\n\n\n===
    Development ===\n\nThe scapula is ossified from 7 or more centers: one for the
    body, two for the coracoid process, two for the acromion, one for the vertebral
    border, and one for the inferior angle. \n\nOssification of the body begins about
    the second month of fetal life, by an irregular quadrilateral plate of bone forming,
    immediately behind the glenoid cavity. \n\nThis plate extends to form the chief
    part of the bone, the scapular spine growing up from its dorsal surface about
    the third month. \n\nOssification starts as membranous ossification before birth.
    After birth, the cartilaginous components would undergo endochondral ossification.
    \n\nThe larger part of the scapula undergoes membranous ossification. Some of
    the outer parts of the scapula are cartilaginous at birth, and would therefore
    undergo endochondral ossification.\n\nAt birth, a large part of the scapula is
    osseous, but the glenoid cavity, the coracoid process, the acromion, the vertebral
    border and the inferior angle are cartilaginous. \n\nFrom the 15th to the 18th
    month after birth, ossification takes place in the middle of the coracoid process,
    which as a rule becomes joined with the rest of the bone about the 15th year.\n\nBetween
    the 14th and 20th years, the remaining parts ossify in quick succession, and
    usually in the following order: first, in the root of the coracoid process, in
    the form of a broad scale; secondly, near the base of the acromion; thirdly,
    in the inferior angle and contiguous part of the vertebral border; fourthly,
    near the outer end of the acromion; fifthly, in the vertebral border.\n\nThe
    base of the acromion is formed by an extension from the spine; the two nuclei
    of the acromion unite, and then join with the extension from the spine. \n\nThe
    upper third of the glenoid cavity is ossified from a separate center (sub coracoid),
    which appears between the 10th and 11th years and joins between the 16th and
    the 18th years. \n\nFurther, an epiphysial plate appears for the lower part of
    the glenoid cavity, and the tip of the coracoid process frequently has a separate
    nucleus. \n\nThese various epiphyses are joined to the bone by the 25th year.\n\nFailure
    of bony union between the acromion and spine sometimes occurs (see os acromiale),
    the junction being effected by fibrous tissue, or by an imperfect articulation;
    in some cases of supposed fracture of the acromion with ligamentous union, it
    is probable that the detached segment was never united to the rest of the bone.\n\n\"In
    terms of comparative anatomy the human scapula represents two bones that have
    become fused together; the (dorsal) scapula proper and the (ventral) coracoid.
    \n\nThe epiphyseal line across the glenoid cavity is the line of fusion. They
    are the counterparts of the ilium and ischium of the pelvic girdle.\"\n\n\n==
    Function ==\n\nThe following muscles attach to the scapula:\n\n\n=== Movements
    ===\n\nMovements of the scapula are brought about by the scapular muscles. \n\nThe
    scapula can perform six actions:\n\nElevation: upper trapezius and levator scapulae\nDepression:
    lower trapezius\nRetraction (adduction): rhomboids and middle trapezius\nProtraction
    (abduction): serratus anterior\nUpward rotation: upper and lower trapezius, serratus
    anterior\nDownward rotation: rhomboids, Levator Scapulae, and Pec Minor\n\n\n==
    Clinical significance ==\n\n\n=== Scapular fractures ===\n\nBecause of its sturdy
    structure and protected location, fractures of the scapula are uncommon. When
    they do occur, they are an indication that severe chest trauma has occurred.\nScapular
    fractures involving the neck of the scapula have two patterns. \n\nOne (rare)
    type of fracture is through the anatomical neck of the scapula. The other more
    common type of fracture is through the surgical neck of the scapula. \n\nThe
    surgical neck exits medial to the coracoid process.An abnormally protruding inferior
    angle of the scapula is known as a winged scapula and can be caused by paralysis
    of the serratus anterior muscle. \n\nIn this condition the sides of the scapula
    nearest the spine are positioned outward and backward. \n\nThe appearance of
    the upper back is said to be wing-like. \n\nIn addition, any condition causing
    weakness of the serratus anterior muscle may cause scapular \"winging\".\n\n\n===
    Impingement syndrome ===\n\nThe scapula plays an important role in shoulder impingement
    syndrome.Abnormal scapular function is called scapular dyskinesis. \n\nOne action
    the scapula performs during a throwing or serving motion is elevation of the
    acromion process in order to avoid impingement of the rotator cuff tendons. \n\nIf
    the scapula fails to properly elevate the acromion, impingement may occur during
    the cocking and acceleration phase of an overhead activity. \n\nThe two muscles
    most commonly inhibited during this first part of an overhead motion are the
    serratus anterior and the lower trapezius. \n\nThese two muscles act as a force
    couple within the glenohumeral joint to properly elevate the acromion process,
    and if a muscle imbalance exists, shoulder impingement may develop.\n\n\n===
    Etymology ===\n\n==== Scapula/Scapulae ====\n\nThe name scapula as synonym of
    shoulder blade is of Latin origin. \n\nIt is commonly used in medical English
    and is part of the current official Latin nomenclature, Terminologia Anatomica.\n\nIn
    classical Latin scapula is only used in its plural scapulae. \n\nAlthough some
    sources mention that scapulae is used to refer during Roman antiquity to the
    shoulders  or to the shoulder blades, others persist in that the Romans used
    scapulae only to refer to the back, in contrast to the pectus, the Latin name
    for breast  or chest.\n\n\n==== Os latum scapularum and related ====\n\nThe Roman
    encyclopedist Aulus Cornelius Celsus who lived during the beginning of the era,
    also used scapulae to refer to the back. He used os latum scapularum to refer
    to the shoulder blade. \n\nThis expressions can be translated as broad (Latin:
    latum) bone (Latin: os) of the back (Latin: scapularum).\n\nA similar expression
    in ancient Greek can be seen in the writings of the Greek philosopher Aristoteles
    and in the writings of the Greek physician Galen. \n\nThey both use the name
    \u1F60\u03BC\u03BF\u03C0\u03BB\u03AC\u03C4\u03B7 to refer to the shoulder blade.
    \n\nThis compound consists of ancient Greek \u1F66\u03BC\u03BF\u03C2, shoulder 
    and \u03C0\u03BB\u03AC\u03C4\u03B7, blade  or flat or broad object. \u03A0\u03BB\u03AC\u03C4\u03B7
    in its plural \u03C0\u03BB\u03AC\u03C4\u03B1\u03B9 without \u1F66\u03BC\u03BF-
    was also used in ancient Greek to refer to the shoulder blades. \n\nIn anatomic
    Latin, \u1F60\u03BC\u03BF\u03C0\u03BB\u03AC\u03C4\u03B7 is Latinized as omoplata.The
    Latin word umerus is related to \u1F66\u03BC\u03BF\u03C2. \n\nThe Romans referred
    with umerus to what is now commonly known in English as the following 3 bones:
    humerus or the upper bone of the arm, the clavicle or the collarbone and the
    scapula or the shoulder blade. \n\nThe spelling humerus is actually incorrect
    in classical Latin.Those three bones were referred to as the ossa (Latin: bones)
    umeri (Latin: of the umerus). \n\nUmerus was also used to refer specifically
    to the shoulder. \n\nThis mirrors the use of \u1F66\u03BC\u03BF\u03C2 in ancient
    Greek as that could refer to the shoulder with the upper arm  or to the shoulder 
    alone.\nSince Celsus, the os umeri could refer specifically to the upper bone
    of the arm. \n\nThe 16th century anatomist Andreas Vesalius used humerus to refer
    to the clavicle. \n\nBesides the aforementioned os latum scapularum, Celsus used
    os latum umeri to refer to the shoulder blade. Similarly, Laurentius used the
    expression latitudo umeri (Latitudo = breadth, width ) to refer to the shoulder
    blade.\n\n\n==== Pala ====\n\nThe Roman physician Caelius Aurelianus (5th century)
    used pala to refer to the shoulder blade. \n\nThe name pala is normally used
    to refer to a spade in Latin and was therefore probably used by Caelius Aurelianus
    to describe the shoulder blade, as both exhibit a flat curvature.\n\n\n==== Spathula/\u03A3\u03C0\u03AC\u03B8\u03B7
    ====\n\nDuring the Middle Ages spathula was used to refer to the shoulder blade.
    \n\nSpathula is a diminutive of spatha, with the latter originally meaning broad,
    two-edged sword without a point, broad, flat, wooden instrument for stirring
    any liquid, a spattle, spatula  or spathe of the palm tree  and its diminutive
    used in classical and late Latin for referring to a leg of pork  or a little
    palmbranch.\n\nThe English word spatula is actually derived from Latin spatula,
    an orthographic variant of spathula. Oddly enough, classical Latin non-diminutive
    spatha can be translated as English spatula, while its Latin diminutive spatula
    is not translated as English spatula.\n\nLatin spatha is derived from ancient
    Greek \u03C3\u03C0\u03AC\u03B8\u03B7. Therefore, the form spathula is more akin
    to its origin than spatula. \n\nAncient Greek \u03C3\u03C0\u03AC\u03B8\u03B7
    has a similar meaning as Latin spatha, as any broad blade, and can also refer
    to a spatula or to the broad blade of a sword., but also to the blade of an oar.
    \n\nThe aforementioned \u03C0\u03BB\u03AC\u03C4\u03B1\u03B9 for shoulder blades
    was also used for blades of an oar. Concordantly \u03C3\u03C0\u03AC\u03B8\u03B7
    was also used to refer to the shoulder blade.\n\nThe English word spade, as well
    as the Dutch equivalent spade  is cognate with \u03C3\u03C0\u03AC\u03B8\u03B7.
    Please notice, that the aforementioned term pala as applied by Roman physician
    Caelius Aurelianus, also means spade. \n\nPala is probably related to the Latin
    verb pandere, to spread out, and to extend. \n\nThis verb is thought to be derived
    from an earlier form spandere, with the root spa-. \u03A3\u03C0\u03AC\u03B8\u03B7
    is actually derived from the similar root sp\u0113(i), that means to extend.\n\nIt
    seems that os latum scapularum, \u1F60\u03BC\u03BF\u03C0\u03BB\u03AC\u03C4\u03B7,
    \u03C0\u03BB\u03AC\u03C4\u03B1\u03B9, pala, spathula and \u03C3\u03C0\u03AC\u03B8\u03B7
    all refer to the same aspect of the shoulder blade, i.e. being a flat, broad
    blade, with the latter three words etymological related to each other.\n\n\n====
    Scapula after the Middle Ages ====\n\nAfter the Middle Ages, the name scapula
    for shoulder blade became dominant. \n\nThe word scapula can etymologically be
    explained by its relatedness to the ancient Greek verb \u03C3\u03BA\u03AC\u03C0\u03C4\u03B5\u03B9\u03BD,
    to dig. \n\nThis relatedness gives rise to several possible explanations.\nFirst,
    the noun \u03C3\u03BA\u03AC\u03C0\u03B5\u03C4\u03BF\u03C2, trench, and the scapula
    related noun \u03C3\u03BA\u03B1\u03C6\u03B7, are both derived from this verb
    and might connect scapula to the notion of concavity. The name scapula then may
    be related to the concavity of the bone that exists due to its spine. The designation
    scapulae is additionally seen as synonym of ancient Greek \u03C3\u03C5\u03BD\u03C9\u03BC\u03AF\u03B1,
    the space between the shoulder blades, that is obviously concave. \u03A3\u03C5\u03BD\u03C9\u03BC\u03AF\u03B1
    consists of \u03C3\u03CD\u03BD, together with, and \u1F66\u03BC\u03BF\u03C2,
    shoulder.Second, scapula, due to its relatedness to \u03C3\u03BA\u03AC\u03C0\u03C4\u03B5\u03B9\u03BD
    might have originally meant shovel. Similarly to the Latin use of pala (spade),
    a resemblance might be felt between the shape of a shovel and the shoulder blade.
    Alternatively, the shoulder blade might have been used originally for digging
    and shoveling.\n\n\n==== Shoulder blade ====\nShoulder blade is colloquial name
    for this bone. Shoulder is cognate to German and Dutch equivalents Schulter and
    schouder. There are a few etymological explanations for shoulder. The first supposes
    that shoulder can be literally translated as that which shields or protects,
    as its possibly related to Icelandic skioldr, shield and skyla, to cover, to
    defend. The second explanation relates shoulder to ancient Greek \u03C3\u03BA\u03AD\u03BB\u03BF\u03C2,
    leg. The latter spots the possible root skel-, meaning to bend, to curve. The
    third explanation links the root skel- to to cleave. This meaning could refer
    to the shape of the shoulder blade.\n\n\n== In other animals ==\n\nIn fish, the
    scapular blade is a structure attached to the upper surface of the articulation
    of the pectoral fin, and is accompanied by a similar coracoid plate on the lower
    surface. \n\nAlthough sturdy in cartilagenous fish, both plates are generally
    small in most other fish, and may be partially cartilagenous, or consist of multiple
    bony elements.\n\nIn the early tetrapods, these two structures respectively became
    the scapula and a bone referred to as the procoracoid (commonly called simply
    the \"coracoid\", but not homologous with the mammalian structure of that name).
    \n\nIn amphibians and reptiles (birds included), these two bones are distinct,
    but together form a single structure bearing many of the muscle attachments for
    the forelimb. \n\nIn such animals, the scapula is usually a relatively simple
    plate, lacking the projections and spine that it possesses in mammals. \n\nHowever,
    the detailed structure of these bones varies considerably in living groups. \n\nFor
    example, in frogs, the procoracoid bones may be braced together at the animal's
    underside to absorb the shock of landing, while in turtles, the combined structure
    forms a Y-shape in order to allow the scapula to retain a connection to the clavicle
    (which is part of the shell). \n\nIn birds, the procoracoids help to brace the
    wing against the top of the sternum.In the fossil therapsids, a third bone, the
    true coracoid, formed just behind the procoracoid. \n\nThe resulting three-boned
    structure is still seen in modern monotremes, but in all other living mammals,
    the procoracoid has disappeared, and the coracoid bone has fused with the scapula,
    to become the coracoid process. \n\nThese changes are associated with the upright
    gait of mammals, compared with the more sprawling limb arrangement of reptiles
    and amphibians; the muscles formerly attached to the procoracoid are no longer
    required. \n\nThe altered musculature is also responsible for the alteration
    in the shape of the rest of the scapula; the forward margin of the original bone
    became the spine and acromion, from which the main shelf of the shoulder blade
    arises as a new structure.\n\n\n=== In dinosaurs ===\n\nIn dinosaurs the main
    bones of the pectoral girdle were the scapula (shoulder blade) and the coracoid,
    both of which directly articulated with the clavicle. \n\nThe clavicle was present
    in saurischian dinosaurs but largely absent in ornithischian dinosaurs. \n\nThe
    place on the scapula where it articulated with the humerus (upper bone of the
    forelimb) is called the glenoid. \n\nThe scapula serves as the attachment site
    for a dinosaur's back and forelimb muscles.\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scapula"

    bones in the human foot:\n\nthe first or medial cuneiform\nthe second or intermediate
    cuneiform, also known as the middle cuneiform\nthe third or lateral cuneiformThey
    are located between the navicular bone and the first, second and third metatarsal
    bones and are medial to the cuboid bone.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThere are three
    cuneiform bones:\n\nThe medial cuneiform (also known as first cuneiform) is the
    largest of the cuneiforms. \n\nIt is situated at the medial side of the foot,
    anterior to the navicular bone and posterior to the base of the first metatarsal.
    \n\nIt articulates with four bones: the navicular, second cuneiform, and first
    and second metatarsals. \n\nThe tibialis anterior and fibularis longus muscle
    inserts at the medial cuneiform bone.\n\nThe tibialis posterior inserts at the
    medial cuneiform, while the flexor hallucis brevis originates from it.\n\nLateral
    to it is the intermediate cuneiform. \n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuneiform_bones"

  descriptionText: "\n\nMOLAR (TOOTH)\n\n\nThe molars or molar teeth are large, flat
    teeth at the back of the mouth. \n\nThey are more developed in mammals. \n\nThey
    are used primarily to grind food during chewing. \n\nThe name molar derives from
    Latin, molaris dens, meaning \"millstone tooth\", from mola, millstone and dens,
    tooth. \n\nMolars show a great deal of diversity in size and shape across mammal
    groups. \n\nThe third molar of humans is sometimes vestigial.\n\n\n== Human anatomy
    ==\n\n\nIn humans, the molar teeth have either four or five cusps. \n\nAdult
    humans have 12 molars, in four groups of three at the back of the mouth. \n\nThe
    third, rearmost molar in each group is called a wisdom tooth. \n\nIt is the last
    tooth to appear, breaking through the front of the gum at about the age of 20,
    although this varies from individual to individual. \n\nRace can also affect
    the age at which this occurs, with statistical variations between groups. \n\nIn
    some cases, it may not even erupt at all.\nThe human mouth contains upper (maxillary)
    and lower (mandibular) molars. \n\nThey are: maxillary first molar, maxillary
    second molar, maxillary third molar, mandibular first molar, mandibular second
    molar, and mandibular third molar.\n\n\n== Mammal evolution ==\n\n\nIn mammals,
    the crown of the molars and premolars is folded into a wide range of complex
    shapes. \n\nThe basic elements of the crown are the more or less conical projections
    called cusps and the valleys that separate them. \n\nThe cusps contain both dentine
    and enamel, whereas minor projections on the crown, called crenulations, are
    the result of different enamel thickness. \n\nCusps are occasionally joined to
    form ridges and expanded to form crests. \n\nCingula are often incomplete ridges
    that pass around the base of the crown.Mammalian, multicusped cheek teeth probably
    evolved from single-cusped teeth in synapsids, although the diversity of therapsid
    molar patterns and the complexity in the molars of the earliest mammals make
    determining how this happened impossible. \n\nAccording to the widely accepted
    \"differentiation theory\", additional cusps have arisen by budding or outgrowth
    from the crown, while the rivalling \"concrescence theory\" instead proposes
    that complex teeth evolved by the clustering of originally separate conical teeth.
    \n\nTherian mammals (placentals and marsupials) are generally agreed to have
    evolved from an ancestor with tribosphenic cheek teeth, with three main cusps
    arranged in a triangle.\n\n\n== Morphology ==\n\n\nEach major cusp on an upper
    molar is called a cone and is identified by a prefix dependent on its relative
    location on the tooth: proto-, para-, meta-, hypo-, and ento-. \n\nSuffixes are
    added to these names: -id is added to cusps on a lower molar (e.g., protoconid);
    -ule to a minor cusp (e.g., protoconulid). \n\nA shelf-like ridge on the lower
    part of the crown (on an upper molar) is called a cingulum; the same feature
    on the lower molar a cingulid, and a minor cusp on these, for example, a cingular
    cuspule or conulid.\n\n\n=== Tribosphenic ===\n\n\nThe design that is considered
    one of the most important characteristics of mammals is a three-cusped shape
    called a tribosphenic molar. \n\nThis molar design has two important features:
    the trigonid, or shearing end, and the talonid, or crushing heel. \n\nIn modern
    tribosphenic molars, the trigonid is towards the front of the jaw and the talonid
    is towards the rear.\n\nThe tribosphenic tooth is found in insectivores and young
    platypuses (adults have no teeth). \n\nUpper molars look like three-pointed mountain
    ranges; lowers look like two peaks and a third off to the side.\nThe tribosphenic
    design appears primitively in all groups of mammals. \n\nSome paleontologists
    believe that it developed independently in monotremes (or australosphenidans),
    rather than being inherited from an ancestor that they share with marsupials
    and placentals (or boreosphenidans); but this idea has critics and the debate
    is still going on. \n\nFor example, the dentition of the Early Cretaceous monotreme
    Steropodon is similar to those of Peramus and dryolestoids, which suggests that
    monotremes are related to some pre-tribosphenic therian mammals, but, on the
    other hand, the status of neither of these two groups is well-established.\n\nSome
    Jurassic mammals, such as Shuotherium and Pseudotribos, have \"reversed tribosphenic\"
    molars, in which the talonid is towards the front. \n\nThis variant is regarded
    as an example of convergent evolution.From the primitive tribosphenic tooth,
    molars have diversified into several unique morphologies. \n\nIn many groups,
    a fourth cusp, the hypocone (hypoconid), subsequently evolved (see below).\n\n\n===
    Quadrate ===\n\n\nQuadrate (also called quadritubercular or euthemorphic) molars
    have an additional fourth cusp on the lingual (tongue) side called the hypocone,
    located posterior to the protocone. \n\nQuadrate molars appeared early in mammal
    evolution and are present in many species, including hedgehogs, raccoons, and
    many primates, including humans.\n\nThere may be a fifth cusp.\n\nIn many mammals,
    additional smaller cusps called conules appear between the larger cusps. \n\nThey
    are named after their locations, e.g. a paraconule is located between a paracone
    and a metacone, a hypoconulid is located between a hypoconid and an entoconid.\n\n\n===
    Bunodont ===\n\n\nIn bunodont molars, the cusps are low and rounded hills rather
    than sharp peaks. \n\nThey are most common among omnivores such as pigs, bears,
    and humans. \n\nBunodont molars are effective crushing devices and often basically
    quadrate in shape.\n\n\n=== Hypsodont ===\n\nHypsodont dentition is characterized
    by high-crowned teeth and enamel that extends far past the gum line, which provides
    extra material for wear and tear. \n\nSome examples of animals with hypsodont
    dentition are cattle and horses, all animals that feed on gritty, fibrous material.
    \n\nHypsodont molars can continue to grow throughout life, for example in some
    species of Arvicolinae (herbivorous rodents).Hypsodont molars lack both a crown
    and a neck. \n\nThe occlusal surface is rough and mostly flat, adapted for crushing
    and grinding plant material. \n\nThe body is covered with cementum both above
    and below the gingival line, below which is a layer of enamel covering the entire
    length of the body. \n\nThe cementum and the enamel invaginate into the thick
    layer of dentin.\n\n\n=== Brachydont ===\n\nThe opposite condition to hypsodont
    is called brachydont or brachyodont (from brachys 'short'). \n\nIt is a type
    of dentition characterized by low-crowned teeth. \n\nHuman teeth are brachydont.A
    brachydont tooth has a crown above the gingival line and a neck just below it,
    and at least one root. \n\nA cap of enamel covers the crown and extends down
    to the neck. \n\nCementum is only found below the gingival line. \n\nThe occlusal
    surfaces tend to be pointed, well-suited for holding prey and tearing and shredding.\n\n\n===
    Zalambdodont ===\n\nZalambdodont molars have three cusps, one larger on the lingual
    side and two smaller on the labial side, joined by two crests that form a V-
    or \u03BB-shape. \n\nThe larger inner cusp might be homologous with the paracone
    in a tribosphenic molar, but can also be fused with the metacone. \n\nThe protocone
    is typically missing. \n\nThe two smaller labial cusps are located on an expanded
    shelf called the stylar shelf. \n\nZalambdodont molars are found in, for example,
    golden moles and solenodons.\n\n\n=== Dilambdodont ===\n\nLike zalambdodont molars,
    dilambdodont molars have a distinct ectoloph, but are shaped like two lambdas
    or a W. \n\nOn the lingual side, at the bottom of the W, are the metacone and
    paracone, and the stylar shelf is on the labial side. \n\nA protocone is present
    lingual to the ectoloph. \n\nDilambdodont molars are present in shrews, moles,
    and some insectivorous bats.\n\n\n=== Lophodont ===\n\n\nLophodont teeth are
    easily identified by the differentiating patterns of ridges or lophs of enamel
    interconnecting the cusps on the crowns. \n\nPresent in most herbivores, these
    patterns of lophs can be a simple, ring-like edge, as in mole rats, or a complex
    arrangement of series of ridges and cross-ridges, as those in odd-toed ungulates,
    such as equids.Lophodont molars have hard and elongated enamel ridges called
    lophs oriented either along or perpendicular to the dental row. \n\nLophodont
    molars are common in herbivores that grind their food thoroughly. \n\nExamples
    include tapirs, manatees, and many rodents.When two lophs form transverse, often
    ring-shaped, ridges on a tooth, the arrangement is called bilophodont. \n\nThis
    pattern is common in primates, but can also be found in lagomorphs (hares, rabbits,
    and pikas) and some rodents.\n\nExtreme forms of lophodonty in elephants and
    some rodents (such as Otomys) is known as loxodonty. \n\nThe African elephant
    belongs to a genus called Loxodonta because of this feature.\n\n\n=== Selenodont
    ===\n\nIn selenodont molars (so-named after moon goddess Selene), the major cusp
    is elongated into crescent-shaped ridge. \n\nExamples include most even-toed
    ungulates, such as cattle and deer.\n\n\n=== Secodont ===\n\n\nMany carnivorous
    mammals have enlarged and blade-like teeth especially adapted for slicing and
    chopping called carnassials. \n\nA general term for such blade-like teeth is
    secodont or plagiaulacoid.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_(tooth)"

  descriptionText: "\n\nCERVICAL VERTEBRAE\n\n\nIn tetrapods, cervical vertebrae
    (singular: vertebra) are the vertebrae of the neck, immediately below the skull.
    \n\nTruncal vertebrae (divided into thoracic and lumbar vertebrae in mammals)
    lie caudal (toward the tail) of cervical vertebrae. \n\nIn sauropsid species,
    the cervical vertebrae bear cervical ribs. \n\nIn lizards and saurischian dinosaurs,
    the cervical ribs are large; in birds, they are small and completely fused to
    the vertebrae. \n\nThe vertebral transverse processes of mammals are homologous
    to the cervical ribs of other amniotes. \n\nMost mammals have seven cervical
    vertebrae, with the only three known exceptions being the manatee with six, the
    two-toed sloth with five or six, and the three-toed sloth with nine.\n\nIn humans,
    cervical vertebrae are the smallest of the true vertebrae and can be readily
    distinguished from those of the thoracic or lumbar regions by the presence of
    a foramen (hole) in each transverse process, through which the vertebral artery,
    vertebral veins, and inferior cervical ganglion pass. \n\nThe remainder of this
    article focuses upon human anatomy.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\n\nBy convention,
    the cervical vertebrae are numbered, with the first one (C1) closest to the skull
    and higher numbered vertebrae (C2\u2013C7) proceeding away from the skull and
    down the spine.\n\nThe general characteristics of the third through sixth cervical
    vertebrae are described here. \n\nThe first, second, and seventh vertebrae are
    extraordinary, and are detailed later.\n\nThe bodies of these four vertebrae
    are small, and broader from side to side than from front to back.\n\nThe anterior
    and posterior surfaces are flattened and of equal depth; the former is placed
    on a lower level than the latter, and its inferior border is prolonged downward,
    so as to overlap the upper and forepart of the vertebra below.\n\nThe upper surface
    is concave transversely, and presents a projecting lip on either side.\n\nThe
    lower surface is concave from front to back, convex from side to side, and presents
    laterally shallow concavities that receive the corresponding projecting lips
    of the underlying vertebra.\n\nThe pedicles are directed laterally and backward,
    and attach to the body midway between its upper and lower borders, so that the
    superior vertebral notch is as deep as the inferior, but it is, at the same time,
    narrower.\n\nThe laminae are narrow and thinner above than below; the vertebral
    foramen is large and of a triangular form.\nThe spinous process is short and
    bifid, the two divisions being often of unequal size. \n\nBecause the spinous
    processes are so short, certain superficial muscles (the trapezius and splenius
    capitis) attach to the nuchal ligament rather than directly to the vertebrae;
    the nuchal ligament itself attaching to the spinous processes of C2\u2013C7 and
    to the posterior tubercle of the atlas.\n\nThe superior and inferior articular
    processes of cervical vertebrae have fused on either or both sides to form articular
    pillars, columns of bone that project laterally from the junction of the pedicle
    and lamina.\n\nThe articular facets are flat and of an oval form:\nthe superior
    face backward, upward, and slightly medially.\nthe inferior face forward, downward,
    and slightly laterally.\n\nThe transverse processes are each pierced by the foramen
    transversarium, which, in the upper six vertebrae, gives passage to the vertebral
    artery and vein, as well as a plexus of sympathetic nerves. \n\nEach process
    consists of an anterior and a posterior part. \n\nThese two parts are joined,
    outside the foramen, by a bar of bone that exhibits a deep sulcus on its upper
    surface for the passage of the corresponding spinal nerve.\n\nThe anterior portion
    is the homologue of the rib in the thoracic region, and is therefore named the
    costal process or costal element. \n\nIt arises from the side of the body, is
    directed laterally in front of the foramen, and ends in a tubercle, the anterior
    tubercle.\n\nThe posterior part, the true transverse process, springs from the
    vertebral arch behind the foramen and is directed forward and laterally; it ends
    in a flattened vertical tubercle, the posterior tubercle.\n\nThe anterior tubercle
    of the sixth cervical vertebra is known as the carotid tubercle or Chassaignac
    tubercle (for \xC9douard Chassaignac). \n\nThis separates the carotid artery
    from the vertebral artery and the carotid artery can be massaged against this
    tubercle to relieve the symptoms of supraventricular tachycardia. \n\nThe carotid
    tubercle is also used as a landmark for anaesthesia of the brachial plexus and
    cervical plexus.\n\nThe cervical spinal nerves emerge from above the cervical
    vertebrae. \n\nFor example, the cervical spinal nerve 3 (C3) passes above C3.\n\n\n===
    Atlas and axis ===\n\nThe atlas (C1) and axis (C2) are the two topmost vertebrae.\n\nThe
    atlas (C1) is the topmost vertebra, and along with the axis forms the joint connecting
    the skull and spine. \n\nIt lacks a vertebral body, spinous process, and discs
    either superior or inferior to it. \n\nIt is ring-like and consists of an anterior
    arch, posterior arch, and two lateral masses.\nThe axis (C2) forms the pivot
    on which the atlas rotates. \n\nThe most distinctive characteristic of this bone
    is the strong odontoid process (dens) that rises perpendicularly from the upper
    surface of the body and articulates with C1. \n\nThe body is deeper in front
    than behind, and prolonged downward anteriorly so as to overlap the upper and
    front part of the third vertebra.\n\n\n=== Vertebra prominens ===\n\nThe vertebra
    prominens, or C7, has a distinctive long and prominent spinous process, which
    is palpable from the skin surface. \n\nSometimes, the seventh cervical vertebra
    is associated with an abnormal extra rib, known as a cervical rib, which develops
    from the anterior root of the transverse process. \n\nThese ribs are usually
    small, but may occasionally compress blood vessels (such as the subclavian artery
    or subclavian vein) or nerves in the brachial plexus, causing pain, numbness,
    tingling, and weakness in the upper limb, a condition known as thoracic outlet
    syndrome. \n\nVery rarely, this rib occurs in a pair.\nThe long spinous process
    of C7 is thick and nearly horizontal in direction. \n\nIt is not bifurcated,
    and ends in a tubercle that the ligamentum nuchae attaches to. \n\nThis process
    is not always the most prominent of the spinous processes, being found only about
    70% of the time, C6 or T1 can sometimes be the most prominent.\n\nThe transverse
    processes are of considerable size; their posterior roots are large and prominent,
    while the anterior are small and faintly marked. \n\nThe upper surface of each
    usually has a shallow sulcus for the eighth spinal nerve, and its extremity seldom
    presents more than a trace of bifurcation.\n\nThe transverse foramen may be as
    large as that in the other cervical vertebrae, but it is generally smaller on
    one or both sides; occasionally, it is double, and sometimes it is absent.\n\nOn
    the left side, it occasionally gives passage to the vertebral artery; more frequently,
    the vertebral vein traverses it on both sides, but the usual arrangement is for
    both artery and vein to pass in front of the transverse process, not through
    the foramen.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\nThe movement of nodding the head takes place
    predominantly through flexion and extension at the atlanto-occipital joint between
    the atlas and the occipital bone. \n\nHowever, the cervical spine is comparatively
    mobile, and some component of this movement is due to flexion and extension of
    the vertebral column itself. \n\nThis movement between the atlas and occipital
    bone is often referred to as the \"yes joint\", owing to its nature of being
    able to move the head in an up-and-down fashion.\n\nThe movement of shaking or
    rotating the head left and right happens almost entirely at the joint between
    the atlas and the axis, the atlanto-axial joint. \n\nA small amount of rotation
    of the vertebral column itself contributes to the movement. \n\nThis movement
    between the atlas and axis is often referred to as the \"no joint\", owing to
    its nature of being able to rotate the head in a side-to-side fashion.\n\n\n==
    Clinical significance ==\n\nCervical degenerative changes arise from conditions
    such as spondylosis, stenosis of intervertebral discs, and the formation of osteophytes.
    \n\nThe changes are seen on radiographs, which are used in a grading system from
    0\u20134 ranging from no changes (0) to early with minimal development of osteophytes
    (1) to mild with definite osteophytes (2) to moderate with additional disc space
    stenosis or narrowing (3) to the stage of many large osteophytes, severe narrowing
    of the disc space, and more severe vertebral end plate sclerosis (4).Injuries
    to the cervical spine are common at the level of the second cervical vertebrae,
    but neurological injury is uncommon. \n\nC4 and C5 are the areas that see the
    highest amount of cervical spine trauma.If it does occur, however, it may cause
    death or profound disability, including paralysis of the arms, legs, and diaphragm,
    which leads to respiratory failure.\n\nCommon patterns of injury include the
    odontoid fracture and the hangman's fracture, both of which are often treated
    with immobilization in a cervical collar or Halo brace.\n\nA common practice
    is to immobilize a patient's cervical spine to prevent further damage during
    transport to hospital. \n\nThis practice has come under review recently as incidence
    rates of unstable spinal trauma can be as low as 2% in immobilized patients.
    \n\nIn clearing the cervical spine, Canadian studies have developed the Canadian
    C-Spine Rule (CCR) for physicians to decide who should receive radiological imaging.\n\n\n===
    Landmarks ===\n\nThe vertebral column is often used as a marker of human anatomy.
    \n\nThis includes:\n\nAt C1, base of the nose and the hard palate\nAt C2, the
    teeth of a closed mouth\nAt C3, the mandible and hyoid bone\nAt C4, the common
    carotid artery bifurcates.\nFrom C4\u20135, the thyroid cartilage\nFrom C6\u20137,
    the cricoid cartilage\nAt C6, the oesophagus becomes continuous with the laryngopharynx
    and also where the larynx becomes continuous with the trachea. \n\nIt is also
    the level where the carotid pulse can be palpated against the transverse process
    of the C6 vertebrae.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_vertebrae"

  descriptionText: "\n\nTHIRD RIB\n\n\n== Structure of the rib cage ==\n\nRibs are
    described based on their location and connection with the sternum. \n\nAll ribs
    are attached posteriorly to the thoracic vertebrae and are numbered accordingly
    one to twelve. \n\nRibs that articulate directly with the sternum are called
    true ribs, whereas those that do not articulate directly are termed false ribs.
    \n\n\n=== Attachment of the rib cage ===\n\nThe terms true ribs and false ribs
    describe rib pairs that are directly or indirectly attached to the sternum. \n\nThe
    first seven rib pairs known as the fixed or vertebrosternal ribs are the true
    ribs (Latin: costae verae) as they connect directly to the sternum; the next
    five pairs (eighth to twelfth) are the false ribs (Latin: costae spuriae). \n\n\n===
    Parts of rib (general) ===\n\nEach rib consists of a head, neck, and a shaft.
    \n\nAll ribs are attached posteriorly to the thoracic vertebrae. \n\nThey are
    numbered to match the vertebrae they attach to \u2013 one to twelve, from top
    (T1) to bottom. \n\nThe head of the rib is the end part closest to the vertebra
    with which it articulates. \n\nIt is marked by a kidney-shaped articular surface
    which is divided by a horizontal crest into two articulating regions. \n\nThe
    upper region articulates with the inferior costal facet on the vertebra above,
    and the larger region articulates with the superior costal facet on the vertebra
    with the same number. \n\nThe transverse process of a thoracic vertebra also
    articulates at the transverse costal facet with the tubercle of the rib of the
    same number. \n\nThe crest gives attachment to the intra-articular ligament.The
    neck of the rib is the flattened part that extends laterally from the head. \n\nThe
    neck is about 3 cm long. \n\nIts anterior surface is flat and smooth, whilst
    its posterior is perforated by numerous foramina and its surface rough, to give
    attachment to the ligament of the neck. \n\nIts upper border presents a rough
    crest (crista colli costae) for the attachment of the anterior costotransverse
    ligament; its lower border is rounded.\n\nOn the posterior surface at the neck,
    is an eminence\u2014the tubercle that consists of an articular and a non-articular
    portion. \n\nThe articular portion is the lower and more medial of the two and
    presents a small, oval surface for articulation with the transverse costal facet
    on the end of the transverse process of the lower of the two vertebrae to which
    the head is connected. \n\nThe non-articular portion is a rough elevation and
    affords attachment to the ligament of the tubercle. \n\nThe tubercle is much
    more prominent in the upper ribs than in the lower ribs.\n\nThe angle of a rib
    (costal angle) may both refer to the bending part of it, and a prominent line
    in this area, a little in front of the tubercle. \n\nThis line is directed downward
    and laterally; this gives attachment to a tendon of the iliocostalis muscle.
    \n\nAt this point, the rib is bent in two directions, and at the same time twisted
    on its long axis.\n\nThe distance between the angle and the tubercle is progressively
    greater from the second to the tenth ribs. \n\nThe area between the angle and
    the tubercle is rounded, rough, and irregular, and serves for the attachment
    of the longissimus dorsi muscle.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rib_cage"

    in his Array against the Alans when he refers to his legions. \n\nIn Greek texts,
    the phalanx may be deployed for battle, on the march, or even camped, thus describing
    the mass of infantry or cavalry that would deploy in line during battle. \n\nThey
    marched forward as one entity. \nThe term itself, as used today, does not refer
    to a distinctive military unit or division (e.g., the Roman legion or the contemporary
    Western-type battalion), but to the type of formation of an army's troops. \n\nTherefore,
    this term does not indicate a standard combat strength or composition but includes
    the total number of infantry, which is deployed in a single formation known as
    a \"phalanx\".\nMany spear-armed troops historically fought in what might be
    termed phalanx-like formations. \n\nThis article focuses on the use of the military
    phalanx formation in Ancient Greece, the Hellenistic world, and other ancient
    states heavily influenced by Greek civilization.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe earliest
    known depiction of a phalanx-like formation occurs in a Sumerian stele from the
    25th century BC. \n\nHere the troops seem to have been equipped with spears,
    helmets, and large shields covering the whole body. \n\nAncient Egyptian infantry
    were known to have employed similar formations. \n\nThe first usage of the term
    phalanx comes from Homer's \"\u03C6\u03B1\u03BB\u03B1\u03B3\u03BE\", used to
    describe hoplites fighting in an organized battle line. \n\nHomer used the term
    to differentiate the formation-based combat from the individual duels so often
    found in his poems.Historians have not arrived at a consensus about the relationship
    between the Greek formation and these predecessors of the hoplites. \n\nThe principles
    of shield wall and spear hedge were almost universally known among the armies
    of major civilizations throughout history, and so the similarities may be related
    to convergent evolution instead of diffusion.\nTraditionally, historians date
    the origin of the hoplite phalanx of ancient Greece to the 8th century BC in
    Sparta, but this is under revision. \n\nIt is perhaps more likely that the formation
    was devised in the 7th century BC after the introduction of the aspis by the
    city of Argos, which would have made the formation possible. \n\nThis is further
    evidenced by the Chigi vase, dated to 650 BC, identifying hoplites armed with
    aspis, spear and panoply.Another possible theory as to the birth of Greek phalanx
    warfare stems from the idea that some of the basic aspects of the phalanx were
    present in earlier times yet were not fully developed due to the lack of appropriate
    technology. \n\nTwo of the basic tactics seen in earlier warfare include the
    principle of cohesion and the use of large groups of soldiers. \n\nThis would
    suggest that the Greek phalanx was rather the culmination and perfection of a
    slowly developed idea that originated many years earlier. \n\nAs weaponry and
    armour advanced through the years in different city-states, the phalanx became
    complex and effective.\n\n\n== Overview ==\n\nThe hoplite phalanx of the Archaic
    and Classical periods in Greece (c. 800\u2013350 BC) was the formation in which
    the hoplites would line up in ranks in close order. \n\nThe hoplites would lock
    their shields together, and the first few ranks of soldiers would project their
    spears out over the first rank of shields. \n\nThe phalanx therefore presented
    a shield wall and a mass of spear points to the enemy, making frontal assaults
    against it very difficult. \n\nIt also allowed a higher proportion of the soldiers
    to be actively engaged in combat at a given time (rather than just those in the
    front rank).\nBattles between two phalanxes usually took place in open, flat
    plains where it was easier to advance and stay in formation. \n\nRough terrain
    or hilly regions would have made it difficult to maintain a steady line and would
    have defeated the purpose of a phalanx. \n\nAs a result, battles between Greek
    city-states would not take place in just any location, nor would they be limited
    to sometimes obvious strategic points. \n\nRather, many times, the two opposing
    sides would find the most suitable piece of land where the conflict could be
    settled. \n\nTypically, the battle ended with one of the two fighting forces
    fleeing to safety.The phalanx usually advanced at a walking pace, although it
    is possible that they picked up speed during the last several yards. \n\nOne
    of the main reasons for this slow approach was to maintain formation. \n\nThe
    formation would be rendered useless if the phalanx was lost as the unit approached
    the enemy and could even become detrimental to the advancing unit, resulting
    in a weaker formation that was easier for an enemy force to break through. \n\nIf
    the hoplites of the phalanx were to pick up speed toward the latter part of the
    advance, it would have been for the purpose of gaining momentum against the enemy
    in the initial collision. \n\nHerodotus states of the Greeks at the Battle of
    Marathon, that \"They were the first Greeks we know of to charge their enemy
    at a run\". \n\nMany historians believe that this innovation was precipitated
    by their desire to minimize their losses from Persian archery. \n\nThe opposing
    sides would collide, possibly severing many of the spears of the row in front
    and killing the front part of the enemy army due to the bone-breaking collision.\nThe
    spears of a phalanx had spiked butts. \n\nIn battle, the back ranks used the
    spikes to finish fallen enemy soldiers.\n\n\n=== Pushing ===\n\nThe \"physical
    pushing match\" theory is one where the battle would rely on the valour of the
    men in the front line, whilst those in the rear maintained forward pressure on
    the front ranks with their shields, and the whole formation would consistently
    press forward trying to break the enemy formation. \n\nThis is the most widely
    accepted interpretation of the ancient sources thus when two phalanx formations
    engaged, the struggle essentially became a pushing match. \n\nHistorians such
    as Victor Davis Hanson point out that it is difficult to account for exceptionally
    deep phalanx formations unless they were necessary to facilitate the physical
    pushing depicted by this theory, as those behind the first two ranks could not
    take part in the actual spear thrusting.No Greek art ever depicts anything like
    a phalanx pushing match, so this hypothesis is a product of educated speculation
    rather than explicit testimony from contemporary sources and is far from being
    academically resolved. \n\nThe Greek term for \"push\" was used in the same metaphorical
    manner as the English word is (for example it was also used to describe the process
    of rhetorical arguments) and so does not necessarily describe a literal physical
    push, although it is possible that it did.\nFor instance, if Othismos were to
    accurately describe a physical pushing match, it would be logical to state that
    the deeper phalanx would always win an engagement since the physical strength
    of individuals would not compensate for even one additional rank on the enemy
    side. \n\nHowever, there are numerous examples of shallow phalanxes holding off
    an opponent. \n\nFor instance, at Delium in 424 BC, the Athenian left flank,
    a formation eight men deep, held off a formation of Thebans 25 deep without immediate
    collapse. \n\nIt is difficult with the physical pushing model to imagine eight
    men withstanding the pushing force of 25 opponents for a matter of seconds, let
    alone half the battle.\nSuch arguments have led to a wave of counter-criticism
    to physical shoving theorists. \n\nAdrian Goldsworthy, in his article \"The Othismos,
    Myths and Heresies: The nature of Hoplite Battle\", argues that the physical
    pushing match model does not fit with the average casualty figures of hoplite
    warfare nor the practical realities of moving large formations of men in battle.
    \n\nThis debate has yet to be resolved amongst scholars.\nPractical difficulties
    with this theory also include the fact that, in a shoving match, an eight-foot
    spear is too long to fight effectively or even parry attacks. \n\nSpears enable
    a formation of men to keep their enemies at a distance, parry attacks aimed at
    them and their comrades, and give the necessary reach to strike multiple men
    in the opposite formation. \n\nA pushing match would put enemies so close together
    that a quick stabbing with a knife would kill the front row almost instantly.
    \n\nThe crush of men would also prevent the formation from withdrawing or retreating,
    which would result in much higher casualties than is recorded. \n\nThe speed
    at which this would occur would also end the battle very quickly, instead of
    prolonging it for hours.\n\n\n=== Shields ===\n\nEach individual hoplite carried
    his shield on his left arm, protecting not only himself but also the soldier
    to the left. \n\nThis meant that the men at the extreme right of the phalanx
    were only half-protected. \n\nIn battle, opposing phalanxes would try to exploit
    this weakness by attempting to overlap the enemy's right flank. \n\nIt also meant
    that, in battle, a phalanx would tend to drift to the right (as hoplites sought
    to remain behind the shield of their neighbor). \n\nSome groups, such as the
    Spartans at Nemea, tried to use this phenomenon to their advantage. \n\nIn this
    case, the phalanx would sacrifice its left side, which typically consisted of
    allied troops, in an effort to overtake the enemy from the flank. \n\nIt is unlikely
    that this strategy worked very often, as it is not mentioned frequently in ancient
    Greek literature.There was a leader in each row of a phalanx, and a rear rank
    officer, the ouragos (meaning tail-leader), who kept order in the rear. \n\nThe
    hoplites had to trust their neighbors to protect them and in turn be willing
    to protect their neighbors; a phalanx was thus only as strong as its weakest
    elements. \n\nThe effectiveness of the phalanx therefore depended on how well
    the hoplites could maintain this formation in combat and how well they could
    stand their ground, especially when engaged against another phalanx. \n\nFor
    this reason, the formation was deliberately organized to group friends and family
    close together, thus providing a psychological incentive to support one's fellows,
    and a disincentive, through shame, to panic or attempt to flee. \n\nThe more
    disciplined and courageous the army, the more likely it was to win \u2013 often
    engagements between the various city-states of Greece would be resolved by one
    side fleeing before the battle. \n\nThe Greek word dynamis, the 'will to fight',
    expresses the drive that kept hoplites in formation.\n\nNow of those, who dare,
    abiding one beside another, to advance to the close fray, and the foremost champions,
    fewer die, and they save the people in the rear; but in men that fear, all excellence
    is lost. \n\nNo one could ever in words go through those several ills, which
    befall a man, if he has been actuated by cowardice. \n\nFor 'tis grievous to
    wound in the rear the back of a flying man in hostile war. \n\nShameful too is
    a corpse lying low in the dust, wounded behind in the back by the point of a
    spear.\n\n\n=== Hoplite armament ===\n\nEach hoplite provided his own equipment.
    \n\nThe primary hoplite weapon was a spear around 2.4 metres (7.9 ft) in length
    called a dory. \n\nAlthough accounts of its length vary, it is usually now believed
    to have been seven to nine feet long (~2.1\u20132.7 m). \n\nIt was held one-handed,
    with the other hand holding the hoplite's shield (aspis). \n\nThe spearhead was
    usually a curved leaf shape, while the rear of the spear had a spike called a
    sauroter ('lizard-killer') which was used to stand the spear in the ground (hence
    the name). \n\nIt was also used as a secondary weapon if the main shaft snapped
    or to kill enemies lying on the ground. \n\nThis was a common problem, especially
    for soldiers who were involved in the initial clash with the enemy. \n\nDespite
    the snapping of the spear, hoplites could easily switch to the sauroter without
    great consequence. \n\nThe rear ranks used the secondary end to finish off fallen
    opponents as the phalanx advanced over them.\nThroughout the hoplite era, the
    standard hoplite armour went through many cyclical changes. \n\nAn Archaic hoplite
    typically wore a bronze breastplate, a bronze helmet with cheekplates, as well
    as greaves and other armour. \n\nLater, in the classical period, the breastplate
    became less common, replaced instead with a corselet that some claim was made
    of linothorax (layers of linen glued together), or perhaps of leather, sometimes
    covered in whole or in part with overlapping metal scales. \n\nEventually, even
    greaves became less commonly used, although degrees of heavier armour remained,
    as attested by Xenophon as late as 401 BC.These changes reflected the balancing
    of mobility with protection, especially as cavalry became more prominent in the
    Peloponnesian War and the need to combat light troops, which were increasingly
    used to negate the hoplite's role as the primary force in battle. \n\nYet bronze
    armour remained in some form until the end of the hoplite era. \n\nSome archaeologists
    have pointed out that bronze armour does not actually provide as much protection
    from direct blows as more extensive corselet padding, and have suggested its
    continued use was a matter of status for those who could afford it. \n\nIn the
    classical Greek dialect, there is no word for swordsmen; yet hoplites also carried
    a short sword called the xiphos, used as a secondary weapon if the dory was broken
    or lost. \n\nSamples of the xiphos recovered at excavation sites were typically
    around 60 cm (24 in) in length. \n\nThese swords were double-edged and could
    therefore be used as a cutting and thrusting weapon. \n\nThese short swords were
    often used to stab or cut at the enemy's neck during close combat.Hoplites carried
    a circular shield called a hoplon (often referred to as an aspis) made from wood
    and covered in bronze, measuring roughly 1 metre (3.3 ft) in diameter. \n\nIt
    spanned from chin to knee and was very heavy (8\u201315 kg (18\u201333 lb)).
    \n\nThis medium-sized shield (fairly large for the period considering the average
    male height) was made possible partly by its dish-like shape, which allowed it
    to be supported with the rim on the shoulder. \n\nThis was quite an important
    feature of the shield, especially for the hoplites that remained in the latter
    ranks. \n\nWhile these soldiers continued to help press forward, they did not
    have the added burden of holding up their shield. \n\nBut the circular shield
    was not without its disadvantages. \n\nDespite its mobility, protective curve,
    and double straps the circular shape created gaps in the shield wall at both
    its top and bottom. (Top gaps were somewhat reduced by the one or two spears
    jutting out of the gap. \n\nIn order to minimize the bottom gaps, thick leather
    'curtains' were used but only by an [unknown] percentage of the hoplites, possibly
    mostly in the first row only since there were disadvantages as well: considerable
    added weight on an already heavy shield and a certain additional cost.) These
    gaps left parts of the hoplite exposed to potentially lethal spear thrusts and
    were a persistent vulnerability for hoplites controlling the front lines.\n\n\n===
    Phalangite armament ===\n\nThe phalanx of the Ancient Macedonian kingdom and
    the later Hellenistic successor states was a development of the hoplite phalanx.
    \n\nThe 'phalangites' were armed with a much longer spear, the sarissa, and less
    heavily armoured. \n\nThe sarissa was the pike used by the ancient Macedonian
    army. \n\nIts actual length is unknown, but apparently it was twice as long as
    the dory. \n\nThis makes it at least 14 feet (4.3 m), but 18 feet (5.5 m) appears
    more likely. (The cavalry xyston was 12.5 feet (3.8 m) by comparison.) The great
    length of the pike was balanced by a counterweight at the rear end, which also
    functioned as a butt-spike, allowing the sarissa to be planted into the ground.
    \n\nBecause of its great length, weight and different balance, a sarissa was
    wielded two-handed. \n\nThis meant that the aspis was no longer a practical defence.
    \n\nInstead, the phalangites strapped a smaller pelte shield (usually reserved
    for peltasts, light skirmishers) to their left forearm. \n\nRecent theories,
    including examination of ancient frescoes depicting full sets of weapons and
    armor, claim that the shields used were actually larger than the pelte but smaller
    than the aspis, hanging by leather strap(s) from the left shoulder or from both
    shoulders. \n\nThe shield would retain handling straps in the inner curve, to
    be handled like a (smaller) aspis if the fight progressed to sword-wielding.
    \n\nAlthough in both shield size assumptions this reduced the shield wall, the
    extreme length of the spear kept the enemy at a greater distance, as the pikes
    of the first three to five ranks could all be brought to bear in front of the
    front row. \n\nThis pike had to be held underhand, as the shield would have obscured
    the soldier's vision had it been held overhead. \n\nIt would also be very hard
    to remove a sarissa from anything it stuck in (the earth, shields, and soldiers
    of the opposition) if it were thrust downwards, due to its length. \n\nThe Macedonian
    phalanx was much less able to form a shield wall, but the lengthened spears would
    have compensated for this. \n\nSuch a phalanx formation also reduced the likelihood
    that battles would degenerate into a pushing match.\n\n\n== Deployment and combat
    ==\n\n=== Phalanx composition and strength ===\n\nThe basic combat element of
    the Greek armies was either the stichos (meaning 'file'; usually 8\u201316 men
    strong) or the enomotia (meaning 'sworn' and made up by 2\u20134 stich\u0153,
    totaling up to 32 men), both led by a dim\u0153rites who was assisted by a decadarchos
    and two decaster\u0153 (sing. decasteros). \n\nFour to a maximum of 32 enomoti\xE6
    (depending on the era in question or the city) were forming a lochos led by a
    lochagos, who in this way was in command of initially 100 hoplites to a maximum
    of c. 500 in the late Hellenistic armies. \n\nHere, it has to be noted that the
    military manuals of Asclepiodotus and Aelian use the term lochos to denote a
    file in the phalanx. \n\nA taxis (mora for the Spartans) was the greatest standard
    hoplitic formation of 500 to 1500 men, led by a strategos (general). \n\nThe
    entire army, a total of several taxeis or mor\xE6 was led by a generals' council.
    \n\nThe commander-in-chief was usually called a polemarchos or a strategos autocrator.\n\n\n===
    Phalanx front and depth ===\n\nHoplite phalanxes usually deployed in ranks of
    eight men or more deep; the Macedonian phalanxes were usually 16 men deep, sometimes
    reported to have been arrayed 32 men deep. \n\nThere are some notable extremes;
    at the battles of Leuctra and Mantinea, the Theban general Epaminondas arranged
    the left wing of the phalanx into a \"hammerhead\" of 50 ranks of elite hoplites
    deep (see below) and when depth was less important, phalanxes just four deep
    are recorded, as at the battle of Marathon.The phalanx depth could vary depending
    on the needs of the moment and plans of the general. \n\nWhile the phalanx was
    in march, an eis bathos formation (loose, meaning literally 'in depth') was adopted
    in order to move more freely and maintain order. \n\nThis was also the initial
    battle formation as, in addition, it permitted friendly units to pass through
    whether assaulting or retreating. \n\nIn this status, the phalanx had twice the
    normal depth and each hoplite had to occupy about 1.8\u20132 metres (5 ft 11
    in\u20136 ft 7 in) in width. \n\nWhen enemy infantry was approaching, a rapid
    switch to the pycne (spelled also pucne) formation (dense or tight formation)
    was necessary. \n\nIn that case, each man's space was halved (0.9\u20131 metre
    or 2 feet 11 inches\u20133 feet 3 inches in width) and the formation depth returned
    to normal. \n\nAn even denser formation, the synaspismos or sunaspismos (ultra-tight
    or locked shields formation), was used when the phalanx was expected to experience
    extra pressure, intense missile volleys or frontal cavalry charges. \n\nIn synaspismos,
    the rank depth was half that of a normal phalanx and the width each man occupied
    was as small as 0.45 metres (1.5 ft).\n\n\n=== Stages of combat ===\n\nSeveral
    stages in hoplite combat can be defined:\nEphodos: The hoplites stop singing
    their p\xE6anes (battle hymns) and move towards the enemy, gradually picking
    up pace and momentum. \n\nIn the instants before impact, war cries (alalagm\u0153,
    sing. alalagmos) would be made. \n\nNotable war cries were the Athenian (eleleleleu!
    eleleleleu!) and the Macedonian (alalalalai! alalalalai!) alalagm\u0153.\nKrousis:
    The opposing phalanxes meet each other almost simultaneously along their front.
    \nDoratismos: Repeated, rapid spear thrusts in order to disrupt the enemy formation.
    \n\nThe use of long spears would keep enemies apart as well as allow men in a
    row to assist their comrades next to them. \n\nThe prodding could also open up
    a man to allow a comrade to spear him. \n\nToo hard prodding could get a spear
    stuck in a shield, which would necessitate someone in the back to lend his to
    the now-disarmed man.\nOthismos: Literally 'pushing' after most spears have been
    broken, the hoplites begin to push with their spears and spear shafts against
    their opponents' shields. \n\nThis could be the longest phase.Pararrhexis: 'Breaching'
    the opposing phalanx, the enemy formation shatters and the battle ends. \n\nCavalry
    would be used at this point to mop up the scattered enemy.\n\n\n== Tactics ==\n\nThe
    early history of the phalanx is largely one of combat between hoplite armies
    from competing Greek city-states. \n\nThe usual result was rather identical,
    inflexible formations pushing against each other until one broke. \n\nThe potential
    of the phalanx to achieve something more was demonstrated at Battle of Marathon
    (490 BC). \n\nFacing the much larger army of Darius I, the Athenians thinned
    out their phalanx and consequently lengthened their front, to avoid being outflanked.
    \n\nHowever, even a reduced-depth phalanx proved unstoppable to the lightly armed
    Persian infantry. \n\nAfter routing the Persian wings, the hoplites on the Athenian
    wings wheeled inwards, destroying the elite troop at the Persian centre, resulting
    in a crushing victory for Athens. \n\nThroughout the Greco-Persian Wars the hoplite
    phalanx was to prove superior to the Persian infantry (e.g. the battles of Thermopylae
    and Plataea).\nPerhaps the most prominent example of the phalanx's evolution
    was the oblique order, made famous in the Battle of Leuctra. \n\nThere, the Theban
    general Epaminondas thinned out the right flank and centre of his phalanx, and
    deepened his left flank to an unheard-of 50 men deep. \n\nIn doing so, Epaminondas
    reversed the convention by which the right flank of the phalanx was strongest.
    \n\nThis allowed the Thebans to assault in strength the elite Spartan troops
    on the right flank of the opposing phalanx. \n\nMeanwhile, the centre and right
    flank of the Theban line were echeloned back, from the opposing phalanx, keeping
    the weakened parts of the formation from being engaged. \n\nOnce the Spartan
    right had been routed by the Theban left, the remainder of the Spartan line also
    broke. \n\nThus, by localising the attacking power of the hoplites, Epaminondas
    was able to defeat an enemy previously thought invincible.\nPhilip II of Macedon
    spent several years in Thebes as a hostage, and paid attention to Epaminondas'
    innovations. \n\nOn return to his homeland, he raised a revolutionary new infantry
    force, which was to change the face of the Greek world. \n\nPhilip's phalangites
    were the first force of professional soldiers seen in Ancient Greece apart from
    Sparta. \n\nThey were armed with longer spears (the sarissa) and were drilled
    more thoroughly in more evolved, complicated tactics and manoeuvres. \n\nMore
    importantly, though, Philip's phalanx was part of a multi-faceted, combined force
    that included a variety of skirmishers and cavalry, most notably the famous Companion
    cavalry. \n\nThe Macedonian phalanx now was used to pin the centre of the enemy
    line, while cavalry and more mobile infantry struck at the foe's flanks. \n\nIts
    supremacy over the more static armies fielded by the Greek city-states was shown
    at the Battle of Chaeronea, where Philip II's army crushed the allied Theban
    and Athenian phalanxes.\n\n\n== Weaknesses ==\n\nThe hoplite phalanx was weakest
    when facing an enemy fielding lighter and more flexible troops without its own
    such supporting troops. \n\nAn example of this would be the Battle of Lechaeum,
    where an Athenian contingent led by Iphicrates routed an entire Spartan mora
    (a unit of anywhere from 500 to 900 hoplites). \n\nThe Athenian force had a considerable
    proportion of light missile troops armed with javelins and bows that wore down
    the Spartans with repeated attacks, causing disarray in the Spartan ranks and
    an eventual rout when they spotted Athenian heavy infantry reinforcements trying
    to flank them by boat.\nThe Macedonian phalanx had weaknesses similar to its
    hoplitic predecessor. \n\nTheoretically indestructible from the front, its flanks
    and rear were very vulnerable, and once engaged it may not easily disengage or
    redeploy to face a threat from those directions. \n\nThus, a phalanx facing non-phalangite
    formations required some sort of protection on its flanks\u2014lighter or at
    least more mobile infantry, cavalry, etc. \n\nThis was shown at the Battle of
    Magnesia, where, once the Seleucid supporting cavalry elements were driven off,
    the phalanx was static and unable to go on the offensive against its Roman opponents
    (although they continued to resist stoutly and attempted a fighting withdrawal
    under a hail of Roman missiles, until the elephants posted on their flanks panicked
    and disrupted their formation).\nThe Macedonian phalanx could also lose its cohesion
    without proper coordination or while moving through broken terrain; doing so
    could create gaps between individual blocks/syntagmata, or could prevent a solid
    front within those sub-units as well, causing other sections of the line to bunch
    up. \n\nIn this event, as in the battles of Cynoscephalae and Pydna, the phalanx
    became vulnerable to attacks by more flexible units\u2014such as Roman legionary
    centuries, which were able to avoid the sarissae and engage in hand-to-hand combat
    with the phalangites.\nAnother important area that must be considered concerns
    the psychological tendencies of the hoplites. \n\nBecause the strength of a phalanx
    depended on the ability of the hoplites to maintain their frontline, it was crucial
    that a phalanx be able to quickly and efficiently replace fallen soldiers in
    the front ranks. \n\nIf a phalanx failed to do this in a structured manner, the
    opposing phalanx would have an opportunity to breach the line which, many times,
    would lead to a quick defeat. \n\nThis then implies that the hoplites ranks closer
    to the front must be mentally prepared to replace their fallen comrade and adapt
    to his new position without disrupting the structure of the frontline.Finally,
    most of the phalanx-centric armies tended to lack supporting echelons behind
    the main line of battle. \n\nThis meant that breaking through the line of battle
    or compromising one of its flanks often ensured victory.\n\n\n== Classical decline
    and post-classical use ==\n\nAfter reaching its zenith in the conquests of Alexander
    the Great, the phalanx began a slow decline, as Macedonian successor states declined.
    \n\nThe combined arms tactics used by Alexander and his father were gradually
    replaced by a return to the simpler frontal charge tactics of the hoplite phalanx.
    \n\nThe expense of the supporting arms and cavalry, and the widespread use of
    mercenaries, caused the Diadochi to rely on phalanx vs. phalanx tactics during
    the Wars of the Diadochi.\nThe decline of the Diadochi and the phalanx was linked
    with the rise of Rome and the Roman legions from the 3rd century BC. \n\nThe
    Battle of the Caudine Forks showed the clumsiness of the Roman phalanx against
    the Samnites. \n\nThe Romans had originally employed the phalanx themselves but
    gradually evolved more flexible tactics. \n\nThe result was the three-line Roman
    legion of the middle period of the Roman Republic, the Manipular System. \n\nRomans
    used a phalanx for their third military line, the triarii. \n\nThese were veteran
    reserve troops armed with the hastae or spear. \n\nRome conquered most of the
    Macedonian successor states. \n\nAlso the various Greek city-states and leagues.
    \n\nAs these states ceased to exist, so did the armies which used the traditional
    phalanx. \n\nSubsequently, troops from these regions were equipped, trained and
    fought using the Roman model.\nA phalanx formation called the phoulkon appeared
    in the late Roman army and Byzantine army. \n\nIt had characteristics of the
    classical Greek and Hellenistic phalanxes, but was more flexible. \n\nIt was
    used against cavalry more than infantry.\nHowever, the phalanx did not totally
    disappear. \n\nIn some battles between the Roman army and Hellenistic phalanxes,
    such as Pydna (168 BC), Cynoscephalae (197 BC) and Magnesia (190 BC), the phalanx
    performed well. \n\nIt even drove back the Roman infantry. \n\nHowever, at Cynoscephalae
    and Magnesia, failure to defend the flanks of the phalanx led to defeat. \n\nAt
    Pydna, the phalanx lost cohesion when pursuing retreating Roman soldiers. \n\nThis
    allowed the Romans to penetrate the formation. \n\nThen, Roman close combat skills
    proved decisive. \n\nThe historian Polybius details the effectiveness of the
    Roman legion against the phalanx. \n\nHe deduces that the Romans refused to fight
    the phalanx where the phalanx was effective, Romans offered battle only when
    a legion could exploit the clumsiness and immobility of a phalanx.\n\nSpear-armed
    troops continued to be important elements in many armies until reliable firearms
    became available. \n\nThese did not necessarily fight as a phalanx. \n\nFor example,
    compare the classical phalanx and late medieval pike formations.Military historians
    have suggested that the Scots under William Wallace and Robert the Bruce consciously
    imitated the Hellenistic phalanx to produce the Scots 'hedgehog' or schiltron.
    \n\nHowever, long spears might have been used by Picts and others in Scotlands'
    Early Middle Ages. \n\nPrior to 1066, long spear tactics (also found in North
    Wales) might have been part of irregular warfare in Britain. \n\nThe Scots used
    imported French pikes and dynamic tactics at the Battle of Flodden. \n\nHowever,
    Flodden found the Scots pitted against effective light artillery, while advancing
    over bad ground. \n\nThe combination disorganised the Scotts phalanxes and permitted
    effective attacks by English longbowmen, and soldiers wielding shorter, handier
    polearms called bills. \n\nSome contemporary sources might say that the bills
    cut off the heads of Scots pikes.\nThe pike was briefly reconsidered as a weapon
    by European armies in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. \n\nIt could protect
    riflemen, whose slower rate of fire made them vulnerable. \n\nA collapsible pike
    was invented but never issued. \n\nThe Confederate Army considered these for
    the American Civil War. \n\nSome were even manufactured but probably were never
    issued. \n\nPikes were manufactured during World War II as \"Croft's Pikes\".\nWhile
    obsolete in military practice, the phalanx remained in use as a metaphor of warriors
    moving forward as a single united block. \n\nThis metaphor inspired several 20th-century
    political movements, notably the Spanish Falange and its ideology of Falangism.\nThe
    Byzantines continued and improved the use of the classical Greek phalanx alongside
    the Macedonian-style phalanx. \n\nThe latter was based on a model that Alexander
    himself had created and had tried to give more importance to the skirmishers
    and cavalry, yet it never saw action until the Byzantines adopted the model that
    rely in a mixture of many units sometimes. \n\nMany writers of the age describe
    the spear as being a sarissa yet it was a meter short than the original sarissa
    and had being modified by the time, yet the term for the long spear remained
    alongside with its other names.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phalanx"

  descriptionText: "\n\nCANINE TOOTH\n\n\nIn mammalian oral anatomy, the canine teeth,
    also called cuspids, dog teeth, or (in the context of the upper jaw) fangs, eye
    teeth, vampire teeth, or vampire fangs, are the relatively long, pointed teeth.
    \n\nThey can appear more flattened however, causing them to resemble incisors
    and leading them to be called incisiform. \n\nThey developed and are used primarily
    for firmly holding food in order to tear it apart, and occasionally as weapons.
    \n\nThey are often the largest teeth in a mammal's mouth. \n\nIndividuals of
    most species that develop them normally have four, two in the upper jaw and two
    in the lower, separated within each jaw by incisors; humans and dogs are examples.
    \n\nIn most species, canines are the anterior-most teeth in the maxillary bone.
    \nThe four canines in humans are the two maxillary canines and the two mandibular
    canines.\n\n\n== Details ==\n\nThere are four canine teeth: two in the upper
    (maxillary) and two in the lower (mandibular) arch. \n\nA canine is placed laterally
    to each lateral incisor and mesial to the premolars. \n\nThey are larger and
    stronger than the incisors, and their roots sink deeply into the bones, and cause
    well-marked prominences upon the surface. \n\nThey are the only teeth in dentition
    with a single cusp, their crowns are roughly triangular from mesial view and
    trapezoidal in buccal view.\n\nThe crown is large and conical, very convex on
    its labial surface, a little hollowed and uneven on its lingual surface, and
    tapering to a blunted point or cusp, which projects beyond the level of the other
    teeth. \n\nThe root is single, but longer and thicker than that of the incisors,
    conical in form, compressed laterally, and marked by a slight groove on each
    side. \n\nThe lingual surface also presents two depressions on either side of
    the surface separated by a ridge in between; these depressions are known as mesial
    and distal lingual fossae.\n\n\n=== Eruption ===\n\nIn humans, the upper canine
    teeth (popularly called eye teeth, from their position under the eyes) are larger
    and longer than the lower, and usually present a distinct basal ridge. \n\nEruption
    typically occurs between the ages of eleven and twelve years for upper canines
    and between nine and ten years for lower canines. \n\nUpper deciduous canines
    also known as the baby tooth, typically erupt between ages of sixteen and twenty-two
    months and sheds between ten and twelve years. \n\nLower deciduous canines typically
    erupt between ages of seventeen and twenty-two months and sheds between nine
    to twelve years \n\n\n=== Developmental defects ===\n\nTransposition (positional
    interchange of two adjacent teeth) is a development defect that most commonly
    found in the permanent canine, with the maxillary being more commonly seen than
    mandibular. \n\nThe upper canine frequently transposed with the first premolar
    whilst the lower canine transposed with the lateral incisor. \n\nOccasionally
    canines are congenitally missing.\n\n\n=== Maxillary canine morphology ===\n\nFrom
    a facial aspect, maxillary canines are approximately one millimetre narrower
    than the central incisor. \n\nTheir mesial aspects resemble the adjacent lateral
    incisors, while their distal aspects anticipate the first premolars. \n\nThey
    are slightly darker and more yellow in color than the other anterior teeth. \n\nFrom
    a lingual aspect, they have well developed mesial and distal marginal ridges
    and a well-developed cingulum. \n\nA prominent lingual ridge divides the lingual
    aspect in half and creates the mesial and distal lingual fossae between the lingual
    ridge and the marginal ridges. \n\nFrom a proximal aspect, they resemble the
    incisors, but are more robust, especially in the cingulum region. \n\nIncisally,
    they are visibly asymmetrical, as the mesial incisal edge is slightly shorter
    than the distal incisal edge, which places the cusp slightly mesial to the long
    axis of the tooth. \n\nThey are also thicker labiolingually than mesiodistally.
    \n\nBecause of the disproportionate incisal edges, the contacts are also asymmetrical.
    \n\nMesially, the contact sits at the junction of the incisal and middle third
    of the crown, while distally, the contact as more cervical, in the middle of
    the middle third of the crown.The root of the maxillary canines are the longest
    root of any tooth and conical in shape.\n\n\n=== Mandibular canine morphology
    ===\n\nThe lower canine teeth are placed nearer the middle line than the upper,
    so that their summits correspond to the intervals between the upper canines and
    the lateral incisors. \n\nFrom a facial aspect, the mandibular canine is notably
    narrower mesiodistally than the maxillary one, the root is compressed mesiodistally
    with well-marked grooves on both sides and may be just as long as the maxillary
    (and at times bifurcated). \n\nA distinctive feature is the nearly straight outline
    this tooth has compared to the maxillary canine which is slightly more bowed.
    \n\nAs in the maxillary canine, the mesial incisal edge (or cusp ridge) is shorter
    than the distal side, however, the cusp is displaced slightly lingual relative
    to the cusp of the maxillary canine.\n\nLingually, the surface of the tooth is
    much smoother compared to the very pronounced surface of the maxillary canine,
    and the cingulum is noted as less developed. \n\nThe cusp may be lost with attrition
    over time and may resemble an upper second permanent incisor.\n\n\n== Sexual
    dimorphism ==\n\nWith many species, the canine teeth in the upper or lower jaw,
    or in both, are much larger in the males than in the females, or are absent in
    females, except sometimes a hidden rudiment. \n\nCertain antelopes, the musk-deer,
    camel, horse, boar, various apes, seals, and the walrus, offer instances.\n\n\n==
    In non-synapsids ==\n\nIn non-synapsids (\"mammal-like reptiles\"), teeth similar
    to canines may be termed \"caniniform\" (\"canine-shaped\") teeth.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canine_tooth"

  descriptionText: "\n\nFRONTAL BONE\n\n\nThe frontal bone is a bone in the human
    skull. \n\nThe bone consists of two portions. \n\nThese are the vertically oriented
    squamous part, and the horizontally oriented orbital part, making up the bony
    part of the forehead, part of the bony orbital cavity holding the eye, and part
    of the bony part of the nose respectively. \n\nThe name comes from the Latin
    word frons (meaning \"forehead\").\n\n\n== Structure of the frontal bone ==\n\nThe
    frontal bone is made up of two main parts. \n\nThese are the squamous part, and
    the orbital part. \n\nThe squamous part marks the vertical, flat, and also the
    biggest part, and the main region of the forehead. \n\nThe orbital part is the
    horizontal and second biggest region of the frontal bone. \n\nIt enters into
    the formation of the roofs of the orbital and nasal cavities. \n\nSometimes a
    third part is included as the nasal part of the frontal bone, and sometimes this
    is included with the squamous part. \n\nThe nasal part is between the brow ridges,
    and ends in a serrated nasal notch that articulates with the nasal bones inferiorly,
    and with the lacrimal and maxilla bones laterally.\n\n\n== Borders ==\n\nThe
    border of the squamous part is thick, strongly serrated, bevelled at the expense
    of the inner table above, where it rests upon the parietal bones, and at the
    expense of the outer table on either side, where it receives the lateral pressure
    of those bones; this border is continued below into a triangular, rough surface,
    which articulates with the great wing of the sphenoid. \n\nThe posterior borders
    of the orbital plates are thin and serrated, and articulate with the small wings
    of the sphenoid.\n\n\n== Development ==\n\n \nThe frontal bone is presumed to
    be derived from neural crest cells.The frontal bone is ossified in membrane from
    two primary centers, one for each half, which appear toward the end of the second
    month of fetal life, one above each supraorbital margin. \n\nFrom each of these
    centers, ossification extends upward to form the corresponding half of the squama,
    and backwards to form the orbital plate. \n\nThe spine is ossified from a pair
    of secondary centers, on either side of the middle line; similar centers appear
    in the nasal part and zygomatic processes.\nAt birth the bone consists of two
    pieces, separated by the frontal suture, which is usually obliterated by Intramembranous
    ossification, except at its lower part, by the eighth year, but occasionally
    persists throughout life. \n\nIt is generally maintained that the development
    of the frontal sinuses begins at the end of the first or beginning of the second
    year, but may begin at birth. \n\nThe sinuses are of considerable size by the
    seventh or eighth year, but do not attain their full proportions until after
    puberty.\n\n\n== Other animals ==\n\nIn most vertebrates, the frontal bone is
    paired, rather than presenting the single, fused structure found in humans (see
    frontal suture). \n\nIt typically lies on the upper part of the head, between
    the eyes, but in many non-mammalian animals it does not form part of the orbital
    cavity. \n\nInstead, in reptiles, bony fish and amphibians it is often separated
    from the orbits by one or two additional bones not found in mammals. \n\nThese
    bones, the prefrontals and postfrontals, together form the upper margin of the
    eye sockets, and lie to either side of the frontal bones.\n\n\n=== Dinosaurs
    ===\n\nThe frontal bone is one of the principal paired mid-line bones in dinosaur
    skulls. \n\nThis bone is part of the skull roof, which is a set of bones that
    cover the brain, eyes and nostrils. \n\nThe frontal makes contact with several
    other bones in the skull. \n\nThe anterior part of the bone articulates with
    the nasal bone and the prefrontal bone. \n\nThe posterior part of the bone articulates
    with the postorbital bone and the parietal bone. \n\nThis bone defines all of
    part of the upper margin of the orbit.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontal_bone"

  descriptionText: "\n\nTEMPORAL BONE\n\n\nThe temporal bones are situated at the
    sides and base of the skull, and lateral to the temporal lobes of the cerebral
    cortex.\n\nThe temporal bones are overlaid by the sides of the head known as
    the temples, and house the structures of the ears. \n\nThe lower seven cranial
    nerves and the major vessels to and from the brain traverse the temporal bone.\n
    \n\n    STRUCTURE\n    \nThe temporal bone consists of four parts\u2014 the squamous,
    mastoid, petrous and tympanic parts. \n\nThe squamous part is the largest and
    most superiorly positioned relative to the rest of the bone. \n\nThe zygomatic
    process is a long, arched process projecting from the lower region of the squamous
    part and it articulates with the zygomatic bone. \n\nPosteroinferior to the squamous
    is the mastoid part. \n\nFused with the squamous and mastoid parts and between
    the sphenoid and occipital bones lies the petrous part, which is shaped like
    a pyramid. \n\nThe tympanic part is relatively small and lies inferior to the
    squamous part, anterior to the mastoid part, and superior to the styloid process.
    \n\nThe styloid, from the Greek stylos, is a phallic shaped pillar directed inferiorly
    and anteromedially between the parotid gland and internal jugular vein. \n\nAn
    elongated or deviated styloid process can result from calcification of the stylohyoid
    ligament in a condition known as Eagle syndrome. \n\n\n    BORDERS\n    \n-Occipitomastoid
    suture. It separates occipital bone and mastoid portion of temporal bone. \n   
    \n-Squamosal suture. It separates parietal bone and squama portion of temporal
    bone. \n    \n-Sphenosquamosal suture. It separates sphenoid bone and squama
    portion of temporal bone. \n    \n-Zygomaticotemporal suture. It separates zygomatic
    bone and zygomatic process of temporal bone. \n    \n    \n    DEVELOPMENT\n\nThe
    temporal bone is ossified from eight centers, exclusive of those for the internal
    ear and the tympanic ossicles: \n    \n    -one for the squama including the
    zygomatic process, \n    -one for the tympanic part,\n    -four for the petrous
    and mastoid parts,\n    -and two for the styloid process.\n        \n    \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_bone"

  descriptionText: "\n\nPREMOLAR\n\n\nThe premolars, also called premolar teeth,
    or bicuspids, are transitional teeth located between the canine and molar teeth.
    \n\nIn humans, there are two premolars per quadrant in the permanent set of teeth,
    making eight premolars total in the mouth. \n\nThey have at least two cusps.
    \n\nPremolars can be considered transitional teeth during chewing, or mastication.
    \n\nThey have properties of both the canines, that lay anterior and molars that
    lay posterior, and so food can be transferred from the canines to the premolars
    and finally to the molars for grinding, instead of directly from the canines
    to the molars.\n\n\n== Human anatomy ==\n\nThe premolars in humans are the maxillary
    first premolar, maxillary second premolar, mandibular first premolar, and the
    mandibular second premolar. \n\nPremolar teeth by definition are permanent teeth
    distal to the canines, preceded by deciduous molars.\n\n\n=== Morphology ===\n\nThere
    is always one large buccal cusp, especially so in the mandibular first premolar.
    \n\nThe lower second premolar almost always presents with two lingual cusps.The
    lower premolars and the upper second premolar usually have one root. \n\nThe
    upper first usually has two roots, but can have just one root, notably in Sinodonts,
    and can sometimes have three roots.Premolars are unique to the permanent dentition.
    \n\nPremolars are referred to as bicuspid (has two main cusps), a buccal and
    a palatal/lingual cusp which are separated by a mesiodistal occlusal fissure.\nThe
    maxillary premolars are trapezoidal in shape. \n\nWhilst the mandibular premolars
    are rhomboidal in shape.\n\n\n==== Maxillary first premolar ====\nThe crown of
    the tooth appears ovoid, wider buccally than palatally\nFrom a buccal view, the
    first premolar is similar to the adjacent canine\nRoots: Two roots buccal and
    palatal. \n\nSometimes (40%) there is only one root.\n\n\n==== Maxillary second
    premolar ====\nSimilar to maxillary first premolar but the mesio-buccal and disto-buccal
    corners are rounder\nThe two cusps are smaller and more equal in size\nShorter
    occlusal fissure\nUsually one root\n\n\n==== Mandibular first premolar ====\n\n-The
    smallest premolar out of all four\n-Dominant buccal cusp and a very small lingual
    cusp\n-The buccal cusp is broad and the lingual cusp is less than half the size
    of the buccal cusp.\n-Two-thirds of the buccal surface can be seen from the occlusal
    aspect\n-A single conical root with an oval/round cross section. \n-The root
    is grooved longitudinally both mesially and distally.\n\n\n==== Mandibular second
    premolar ====\n\nThe crown is larger than the mandibular first premolar\nLingual
    cusp is smaller than the buccal cusp but better developed.\n\nThe lingual and
    buccal cusp is separated by a well defined mesiodistal occlusal fissure\n\nThe
    lingual cusp is divided into two; the mesiolingual and distolingual cusps with
    the mesiolingual cusp being higher and wider than the distolingual.\n\nRoot:
    Single conical root, oval/round in cross section.\n\n\n== Orthodontics ==\n\nThe
    four first premolars are the most commonly removed teeth, in 48.8% of cases,
    when teeth are removed for orthodontic treatment (which is in 45.8% of orthodontic
    patients). \n\nThe removal of only the maxillary first premolars is the second
    likeliest option, in 14.5% of cases.\n\n\n== Other mammals ==\n\nIn primitive
    placental mammals there are four premolars per quadrant, but the most mesial
    two (closer to the front of the mouth) have been lost in catarrhines (Old World
    monkeys and apes, including humans). \n\nPaleontologists therefore refer to human
    premolars as Pm3 and Pm4.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premolar"

  descriptionText: "\n\nTEMPORAL BONE\n\n\nThe temporal bones are situated at the
    sides and base of the skull, and lateral to the temporal lobes of the cerebral
    cortex.\n\nThe temporal bones are overlaid by the sides of the head known as
    the temples, and house the structures of the ears. \n\nThe lower seven cranial
    nerves and the major vessels to and from the brain traverse the temporal bone.\n
    \n\n    STRUCTURE\n    \nThe temporal bone consists of four parts\u2014 the squamous,
    mastoid, petrous and tympanic parts. \n\nThe squamous part is the largest and
    most superiorly positioned relative to the rest of the bone. \n\nThe zygomatic
    process is a long, arched process projecting from the lower region of the squamous
    part and it articulates with the zygomatic bone. \n\nPosteroinferior to the squamous
    is the mastoid part. \n\nFused with the squamous and mastoid parts and between
    the sphenoid and occipital bones lies the petrous part, which is shaped like
    a pyramid. \n\nThe tympanic part is relatively small and lies inferior to the
    squamous part, anterior to the mastoid part, and superior to the styloid process.
    \n\nThe styloid, from the Greek stylos, is a phallic shaped pillar directed inferiorly
    and anteromedially between the parotid gland and internal jugular vein. \n\nAn
    elongated or deviated styloid process can result from calcification of the stylohyoid
    ligament in a condition known as Eagle syndrome. \n\n\n    BORDERS\n    \n-Occipitomastoid
    suture. It separates occipital bone and mastoid portion of temporal bone. \n   
    \n-Squamosal suture. It separates parietal bone and squama portion of temporal
    bone. \n    \n-Sphenosquamosal suture. It separates sphenoid bone and squama
    portion of temporal bone. \n    \n-Zygomaticotemporal suture. It separates zygomatic
    bone and zygomatic process of temporal bone. \n    \n    \n    DEVELOPMENT\n\nThe
    temporal bone is ossified from eight centers, exclusive of those for the internal
    ear and the tympanic ossicles: \n    \n    -one for the squama including the
    zygomatic process, \n    -one for the tympanic part,\n    -four for the petrous
    and mastoid parts,\n    -and two for the styloid process.\n        \n    \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_bone"

  descriptionText: "\n\nLUMBAR VERTEBRAE\n\n\nThe lumbar vertebrae are, in human
    anatomy, the five vertebrae between the rib cage and the pelvis. \n\nThey are
    the largest segments of the vertebral column and are characterized by the absence
    of the foramen transversarium within the transverse process (since it is only
    found in the cervical region) and by the absence of facets on the sides of the
    body (as found only in the thoracic region). \n\nThey are designated L1 to L5,
    starting at the top. \n\nThe lumbar vertebrae help support the weight of the
    body, and permit movement.\n\n\n== Human anatomy ==\n\n=== General characteristics
    ===\n\nThe figure on the left depicts the general characteristics of the first
    through fourth lumbar vertebrae. \n\nThe fifth vertebra contains certain peculiarities,
    which are detailed below.\n\nAs with other vertebrae, each lumbar vertebra consists
    of a vertebral body and a vertebral arch. \n\nThe vertebral arch, consisting
    of a pair of pedicles and a pair of laminae, encloses the vertebral foramen (opening)
    and supports seven processes.\n\n\n==== Body ====\n\nThe vertebral body of each
    lumbar vertebra is kidney shaped, wider from side to side than from front to
    back, and a little thicker in front than in back. \n\nIt is flattened or slightly
    concave above and below, concave behind, and deeply constricted in front and
    at the sides.\n\n\n==== Arch ====\n\nThe pedicles are very strong, directed backward
    from the upper part of the vertebral body; consequently, the inferior vertebral
    notches are of considerable depth. \n\nThe pedicles change in morphology from
    the upper lumbar to the lower lumbar. \n\nThey increase in sagittal width from
    9 mm to up to 18 mm at L5. \n\nThey increase in angulation in the axial plane
    from 10 degrees to 20 degrees by L5. \n\nThe pedicle is sometimes used as a portal
    of entrance into the vertebral body for fixation with pedicle screws or for placement
    of bone cement as with kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty.\n\nThe laminae are broad,
    short, and strong. \n\nThey form the posterior portion of the vertebral arch.
    \n\nIn the upper lumbar region the lamina are taller than wide but in the lower
    lumbar vertebra the lamina are wider than tall. \n\nThe lamina connects the spinous
    process to the pedicles.\nThe vertebral foramen within the arch is triangular,
    larger than the thoracic vertebrae, but smaller than in the cervical vertebrae.\n\n\n====
    Processes ====\n\nThe spinous process is thick, broad, and somewhat quadrilateral;
    it projects backward and ends in a rough, uneven border, thickest below where
    it is occasionally notched.The superior and inferior articular processes are
    well-defined, projecting respectively upward and downward from the junctions
    of pedicles and laminae. \n\nThe facets on the superior processes are concave,
    and look backward and medialward; those on the inferior are convex, and are directed
    forward and lateralward. \n\nThe former are wider apart than the latter since
    in the articulated column, the inferior articular processes are embraced by the
    superior processes of the subjacent vertebra.The transverse processes are long
    and slender. \n\nThey are horizontal in the upper three lumbar vertebrae and
    incline a little upward in the lower two. \n\nIn the upper three vertebrae they
    arise from the junctions of the pedicles and laminae, but in the lower two they
    are set farther forward and spring from the pedicles and posterior parts of the
    vertebral bodies. \n\nThey are situated in front of the articular processes instead
    of behind them as in the thoracic vertebrae, and are homologous with the ribs.\n\nThree
    portions or tubercles can be noticed in a transverse process of a lower lumbar
    vertebrae: the lateral or costiform process, the mammillary process, and the
    accessory process. \n\nThe costiform is lateral, the mammillary is superior (cranial),
    and the accessory is inferior (caudal). \n\nThe mammillary is connected in the
    lumbar region with the back part of the superior articular process. \n\nThe accessory
    process is situated at the back part of the base of the transverse process. \n\nThe
    tallest and thickest costiform process is usually that of L5.\n\n\n=== First
    and fifth lumbar vertebrae ===\n\n\nThe first lumbar vertebra is level with the
    anterior end of the ninth rib. \n\nThis level is also called the important transpyloric
    plane, since the pylorus of the stomach is at this level. \n\nOther important
    structures are also located at this level, they include; fundus of the gall bladder,
    celiac trunk, superior mesenteric artery, termination of spinal cord, beginning
    of filum terminalis, renal vessels, middle suprarenal arteries, and hila of kidneys.\n\nThe
    fifth lumbar vertebra is characterized by its body being much deeper in front
    than behind, which accords with the prominence of the sacrovertebral articulation;
    by the smaller size of its spinous process; by the wide interval between the
    inferior articular processes, and by the thickness of its transverse processes,
    which spring from the body as well as from the pedicles.\n\nThe fifth lumbar
    vertebra is by far the most common site of spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis.Most
    individuals have five lumbar vertebrae, while some have four or six. \n\nLumbar
    disorders that normally affect L5 will affect L4 or L6 in these latter individuals.\n\n\n===
    Segmental movements ===\n\nThe range of segmental movements in a single segment
    is difficult to measure clinically, not only because of variations between individuals,
    but also because it is age and sex dependent. \n\nFurthermore, flexion and extension
    in the lumbal spine is the product of a combination of rotation and translation
    in the sagittal plane between each vertebra.Ranges of segmental movements in
    the lumbar spine (White and Punjabi, 1990) are (in degrees):\n\n\n=== Congenital
    anomalies ===\n\nCongenital vertebral anomalies can cause compression of the
    spinal cord by deforming the vertebral canal or causing instability.\n\n\n==
    Other animals ==\n\nAfrican apes have three and four lumbar vertebrae, (bonobos
    have longer spines with an additional vertebra) and humans normally five. \n\nThis
    difference, and because the lumbar spines of the extinct Nacholapithecus (a Miocene
    hominoid with six lumbar vertebrae and no tail) are similar to those of early
    Australopithecus and early Homo, it is assumed that the Chimpanzee-human last
    common ancestor also had a long vertebral column with a long lumbar region and
    that the reduction in the number of lumbar vertebrae evolved independently in
    each ape clade.\n\nThe limited number of lumbar vertebrae in chimpanzees and
    gorillas result in an inability to lordose (curve) their lumbar spines, in contrast
    to the spines of Old World monkeys and Nacholapithecus and Proconsul, which suggests
    that the last common ancestor was not \"short-backed\" as previously believed.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumbar_vertebrae"

  descriptionText: "\n\nMALLEUS\n\n\nThe malleus, or hammer, is a hammer-shaped small
    bone or ossicle of the middle ear. \n\nIt connects with the incus, and is attached
    to the inner surface of the eardrum. The word is Latin for 'hammer' or 'mallet'.
    \n\nIt transmits the sound vibrations from the eardrum to the incus (anvil).
    \n\n===Structure===\n\nSee also: Ossicles\n\nThe malleus is a bone situated in
    the middle ear. \n\nIt is the first of the three ossicles, and attached to the
    tympanic membrane. \n\nThe head of the malleus is the large protruding section,
    which attaches to the incus. \n\nThe head connects to the neck of malleus. \n\nThe
    bone continues as the handle (or manubrium) of malleus, which connects to the
    tympanic membrane. \n\nBetween the neck and handle of the malleus, lateral and
    anterior processes emerge from the bone. \n\nThe bone is oriented so that the
    head is superior and the handle is inferior.\n\n\n===Development===\n\nEmbryologically,
    the malleus is derived from the first pharyngeal arch along with the incus. \n\nIt
    grows from Meckel's cartilage.\n\n===Function===\n\nMain article: Hearing\n\nThe
    malleus is one of three ossicles in the middle ear which transmit sound from
    the tympanic membrane (ear drum) to the inner ear. \n\nThe malleus receives vibrations
    from the tympanic membrane and transmits this to the incus.\n\n\n===Clinical
    significance===\n\nThe malleus may be palpated by surgeons during ear surgery.
    It may become fixed in place due to surgical complications, causing hearing loss.
    \n\nThis may be corrected with further surgery.\n\n\n===History===\n\nSeveral
    sources attribute the discovery of the malleus to the anatomist and philosopher
    Alessandro Achillini. \n\nThe first brief written description of the malleus
    was by Berengario da Carpi in his Commentaria super anatomia Mundini (1521).
    \n\nNiccolo Massa's Liber introductorius anatomiae described the malleus in slightly
    more detail and likened both it and the incus to little hammers terming them
    malleoli.\n\n\n===Other animals===\n\nThe malleus is unique to mammals, and evolved
    from a lower jaw bone in basal amniotes called the articular, which still forms
    part of the jaw joint in reptiles and birds.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malleus"

  descriptionText: "\n\nTALUS (BONE)\n\n\nThe talus (Latin for ankle), talus bone,
    astragalus , or ankle bone is one of the group of foot bones known as the tarsus.
    \n\nThe tarsus forms the lower part of the ankle joint. \n\nIt transmits the
    entire weight of the body from the lower legs to the foot.\n\nThe talus has joints
    with the two bones of the lower leg, the tibia and thinner fibula. \n\nThese
    leg bones have two prominences (the lateral and medial malleoli) that articulate
    with the talus. \n\nAt the foot end, within the tarsus, the talus articulates
    with the calcaneus (heel bone) below, and with the curved navicular bone in front;
    together, these foot articulations form the ball-and-socket-shaped talocalcaneonavicular
    joint. \n\nThe talus is the second largest of the tarsal bones; it is also one
    of the bones in the human body with the highest percentage of its surface area
    covered by articular cartilage. \n\nIt is also unusual in that it has a retrograde
    blood supply, i.e. arterial blood enters the bone at the distal end.\n\nIn humans,
    no muscles attach to the talus, unlike most bones, and its position therefore
    depends on the position of the neighbouring bones.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\n\nThough
    irregular in shape, the talus can be subdivided into three parts.\nFacing anteriorly,
    the head carries the articulate surface of the navicular bone, and the neck,
    the roughened area between the body and the head, has small vascular channels.\n\nThe
    body features several prominent articulate surfaces: On its superior side is
    the trochlea tali, which is semi-cylindrical, and it is flanked by the articulate
    facets for the two malleoli. \n\nThe ankle mortise, the fork-like structure of
    the malleoli, holds these three articulate surfaces in a steady grip, which guarantees
    the stability of the ankle joint. \n\nHowever, because the trochlea is wider
    in front than at the back (approximately 5\u20136 mm) the stability in the joint
    vary with the position of the foot: with the foot dorsiflexed (toes pulled upward)
    the ligaments of the joint are kept stretched, which guarantees the stability
    of the joint; but with the foot plantarflexed (as when standing on the toes)
    the narrower width of the trochlea causes the stability to decrease. \n\nBehind
    the trochlea is a posterior process with a medial and a lateral tubercle separated
    by a groove for the tendon of the flexor hallucis longus. \n\nExceptionally,
    the lateral of these tubercles forms an independent bone called os trigonum or
    accessory talus; it may represent the tarsale proximale intermedium. \n\nOn the
    bone's inferior side, three articular surfaces serve for the articulation with
    the calcaneus, and several variously developed articular surfaces exist for the
    articulation with ligaments.For descriptive purposes the talus bone is divided
    into three sections, neck, body, and head.\n\n\n=== Head ===\n\nThe talus bone
    of the ankle joint connects the leg to the foot.\nThe head of talus looks forward
    and medialward; its anterior articular or navicular surface is large, oval, and
    convex. \n\nIts inferior surface has two facets, which are best seen in the fresh
    condition.\n\nThe medial, situated in front of the middle calcaneal facet, is
    convex, triangular, or semi-oval in shape, and rests on the plantar calcaneonavicular
    ligament; the lateral, named the anterior calcaneal articular surface, is somewhat
    flattened, and articulates with the facet on the upper surface of the anterior
    part of the calcaneus.\n\n\n=== Neck ===\n\nThe neck of talus is directed anteromedially,
    and comprises the constricted portion of the bone between the body and the oval
    head.\n\nIts upper and medial surfaces are rough, for the attachment of ligaments;
    its lateral surface is concave and is continuous below with the deep groove for
    the interosseous talocalcaneal ligament.\n\n\n=== Body ===\n\nThe body of the
    talus comprises most of the volume of the talus bone (ankle bone). \n\nIt presents
    with five surfaces; a superior, inferior, medial, lateral and a posterior:\n   
    \n-The superior surface of the body presents, behind, a smooth trochlear surface,
    the trochlea, for articulation with the tibia. \n\nThe trochlea is broader in
    front than behind, convex from before backward, slightly concave from side to
    side: in front it is continuous with the upper surface of the neck of the bone.\nthe
    inferior surface presents two articular areas, the posterior and middle calcaneal
    surfaces, separated from one another by a deep groove, the sulcus tali. \n\nThe
    groove runs obliquely forward and lateralward, becoming gradually broader and
    deeper in front: in the articulated foot it lies above a similar groove upon
    the upper surface of the calcaneus, and forms, with it, a canal (sinus tarsi)
    filled up in the fresh state by the interosseous talocalcaneal ligament. \n\nThe
    posterior calcaneal articular surface is large and of an oval or oblong form.
    \n\nIt articulates with the corresponding facet on the upper surface of the calcaneus,
    and is deeply concave in the direction of its long axis which runs forward and
    lateralward at an angle of about 45\xB0 with the median plane of the body. \n\nThe
    middle calcaneal articular surface is small, oval in form and slightly convex;
    it articulates with the upper surface of the sustentaculum tali of the calcaneus.\n\n-The
    medial surface presents at its upper part a pear-shaped articular facet for the
    medial malleolus, continuous above with the trochlea; below the articular surface
    is a rough depression for the attachment of the deep portion of the deltoid ligament
    of the ankle-joint.\n\n-The lateral surface carries a large triangular facet,
    concave from above downward, for articulation with the lateral malleolus; its
    anterior half is continuous above with the trochlea; and in front of it is a
    rough depression for the attachment of the anterior talofibular ligament. \n\nBetween
    the posterior half of the lateral border of the trochlea and the posterior part
    of the base of the fibular articular surface is a triangular facet which comes
    into contact with the transverse inferior tibiofibular ligament during flexion
    of the ankle-joint; below the base of this facet is a groove which affords attachment
    to the posterior talofibular ligament.\n\n-The posterior surface is narrow, and
    traversed by a groove running obliquely downward and medialward, and transmitting
    the tendon of the Flexor hallucis longus. \n\nLateral to the groove is a prominent
    tubercle, the posterior process, to which the posterior talofibular ligament
    is attached; this process is sometimes separated from the rest of the talus,
    and is then known as the os trigonum. \n\nMedial to the groove is a second smaller
    tubercle.\n\n\n== Development ==\n\nDuring the 7-8th intrauterine month an ossification
    center is formed in the anklebone.\n\n\n== Fracture ==\n\nThe talus bone lacks
    a good blood supply. \n\nBecause of this, healing a broken talus can take longer
    than most other bones. \n\nOne with a broken talus may not be able to walk for
    many months without crutches and will further wear a walking cast or boot of
    some kind after that.\n\nTalus injuries may be difficult to recognize, and lateral
    process fractures in particular may be radiographically occult. \n\nIf not recognized
    and managed appropriately, a talus fracture may result in complications and long-term
    morbidity. \n\nA 2015 review came to the conclusion that isolated talar body
    fractures may be more common than previously thought.\n\nA fractured talar body
    often has a displacement that is best visualised using CT imaging. \n\nIn case
    a talus fracture is accompanied by a dislocation, restoration of articular and
    axial alignment is necessary to optimize ankle and hindfoot function.\n\n\n==
    As dice ==\n\nDice were originally made from the talus of hoofed animals, leading
    to the nickname \"bones\" for dice. \n\nColloquially known as \"knucklebones\",
    these are approximately tetrahedral. \n\nModern Mongolians still use such bones
    as shagai for games and fortune-telling, with each piece relating to a symbolic
    meaning.\n\n\n== In other animals ==\n\nThe talus apparently derives from the
    fusion of three separate bones in the feet of primitive amphibians; the tibiale,
    articulating with tibia, the intermedium, between the bases of the tibia and
    fibula, and the fourth centrale, lying in the mid-part of the tarsus. \n\nThese
    bones are still partially separate in modern amphibians, which therefore do not
    have a true talus. \n\nThe talus forms a considerably more flexible joint in
    mammals than it does in reptiles. \n\nThis reaches its greatest extent in artiodactyls,
    where the distal surface of the bone has a smooth keel to allow greater freedom
    of movement of the foot, and thus increase running speed.\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talus_bone"

  descriptionText: "\n\nCALCANEUS\n\n\nIn humans and many other primates, the calcaneus
    (from the Latin calcaneus or calcaneum, meaning heel) or heel bone is a bone
    of the tarsus of the foot which constitutes the heel. \n\nIn some other animals,
    it is the point of the hock.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nIn humans, the calcaneus
    is the largest of the tarsal bones and the largest bone of the foot. \n\nThe
    talus bone, calcaneus, and navicular bone are considered the proximal row of
    tarsal bones. \n\nIn the calcaneus, several important structures can be distinguished:The
    half of the bone closest to the heel is the calcaneal tuberosity. \n\nOn its
    lower edge on either side are its lateral and medial processes (serving as the
    origins of the abductor hallucis and abductor digiti minimi). \n\nThe Achilles
    tendon is inserted into a roughened area on its superior side, the cuboid bone
    articulates with its anterior side, and on its superior side are three articular
    surfaces for the articulation with the talus bone. \n\nBetween these superior
    articulations and the equivalents on the talus is the tarsal sinus (a canal occupied
    by the interosseous talocalcaneal ligament). \n\nAt the upper and forepart of
    the medial surface of the calcaneus, below the middle talar facet, there is a
    horizontal eminence, the talar shelf (also sustentaculum tali), which gives attachment
    to the plantar calcaneonavicular (spring) ligament, tibiocalcaneal ligament,
    and medial talocalcaneal ligament. \n\nThis eminence is concave above, and articulates
    with the middle calcaneal articular surface of the talus; below, it is grooved
    for the tendon of the flexor hallucis longus; its anterior margin gives attachment
    to the plantar calcaneonavicular ligament, and its medial margin to a part of
    the deltoid ligament of the ankle-joint.\n\nOn the lateral side is commonly a
    tubercle called the calcaneal tubercle (or trochlear process). \n\nThis is a
    raised projection located between the tendons of the peroneus longus and brevis.
    \n\nIt separates the two oblique grooves of the lateral surface of the calcaneus
    (for the tendons of the peroneal muscles).\n\nIts chief anatomical significance
    is as a point of divergence of the previously common pathway shared by the distal
    tendons of peroneus longus and peroneus brevis en route to their distinct respective
    attachment sites.\n\nThe calcaneus is part of two joints: the proximal intertarsal
    joint and the talocalcaneal joint. \n\nThe point of the calcaneus is covered
    by the calcanean bursa.\n\n\n=== Development ===\n\nIn the calcaneus, an ossification
    center, is developed during the 4th\u20137th week of fetal development.\n\n\n==
    Function ==\n\nThree muscles insert on the calcaneus: the gastrocnemius, soleus,
    and plantaris. \n\nThese muscles are part of the posterior compartment of the
    leg and aid in walking, running and jumping. \n\nTheir specific functions include
    plantarflexion of the foot, flexion of the knee, and steadying the leg on the
    ankle during standing. \n\nThe calcaneus also serves as origin for several short
    muscles that run along the sole of the foot and control the toes.\n\n\n== Clinical
    significance ==\n\n\nNormally the tibia sits vertically above the calcaneus (pes
    rectus). \n\nIf the calcaneal axis between these two bones is turned medially
    the foot is in an everted position (pes valgus), and if it is turned laterally
    the foot is in an inverted position (pes varus).\n\nCalcaneal fracture, also
    known as Lover's fracture and Don Juan fracture\n\n\n== Disease ==\n\nThe talar
    shelf is typically involved in subtalar or talocalcaneal tarsal coalition.\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcaneus"

    plural phalanxes or phalanges, \u03C6\u03AC\u03BB\u03B1\u03B3\u03B3\u03B5\u03C2,
    phalanges) was a rectangular mass military formation, usually composed entirely
    of heavy infantry armed with spears, pikes, sarissas, or similar pole weapons.
    \n\nThe term is particularly used to describe the use of this formation in Ancient
    Greek warfare, although the ancient Greek writers used it to also describe any
    massed infantry formation, regardless of its equipment. \n\nArrian uses the term
    in his Array against the Alans when he refers to his legions. \n\nIn Greek texts,
    the phalanx may be deployed for battle, on the march, or even camped, thus describing
    the mass of infantry or cavalry that would deploy in line during battle. \n\nThey
    marched forward as one entity. \nThe term itself, as used today, does not refer
    to a distinctive military unit or division (e.g., the Roman legion or the contemporary
    Western-type battalion), but to the type of formation of an army's troops. \n\nTherefore,
    this term does not indicate a standard combat strength or composition but includes
    the total number of infantry, which is deployed in a single formation known as
    a \"phalanx\".\nMany spear-armed troops historically fought in what might be
    termed phalanx-like formations. \n\nThis article focuses on the use of the military
    phalanx formation in Ancient Greece, the Hellenistic world, and other ancient
    states heavily influenced by Greek civilization.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe earliest
    known depiction of a phalanx-like formation occurs in a Sumerian stele from the
    25th century BC. \n\nHere the troops seem to have been equipped with spears,
    helmets, and large shields covering the whole body. \n\nAncient Egyptian infantry
    were known to have employed similar formations. \n\nThe first usage of the term
    phalanx comes from Homer's \"\u03C6\u03B1\u03BB\u03B1\u03B3\u03BE\", used to
    describe hoplites fighting in an organized battle line. \n\nHomer used the term
    to differentiate the formation-based combat from the individual duels so often
    found in his poems.Historians have not arrived at a consensus about the relationship
    between the Greek formation and these predecessors of the hoplites. \n\nThe principles
    of shield wall and spear hedge were almost universally known among the armies
    of major civilizations throughout history, and so the similarities may be related
    to convergent evolution instead of diffusion.\nTraditionally, historians date
    the origin of the hoplite phalanx of ancient Greece to the 8th century BC in
    Sparta, but this is under revision. \n\nIt is perhaps more likely that the formation
    was devised in the 7th century BC after the introduction of the aspis by the
    city of Argos, which would have made the formation possible. \n\nThis is further
    evidenced by the Chigi vase, dated to 650 BC, identifying hoplites armed with
    aspis, spear and panoply.Another possible theory as to the birth of Greek phalanx
    warfare stems from the idea that some of the basic aspects of the phalanx were
    present in earlier times yet were not fully developed due to the lack of appropriate
    technology. \n\nTwo of the basic tactics seen in earlier warfare include the
    principle of cohesion and the use of large groups of soldiers. \n\nThis would
    suggest that the Greek phalanx was rather the culmination and perfection of a
    slowly developed idea that originated many years earlier. \n\nAs weaponry and
    armour advanced through the years in different city-states, the phalanx became
    complex and effective.\n\n\n== Overview ==\n\nThe hoplite phalanx of the Archaic
    and Classical periods in Greece (c. 800\u2013350 BC) was the formation in which
    the hoplites would line up in ranks in close order. \n\nThe hoplites would lock
    their shields together, and the first few ranks of soldiers would project their
    spears out over the first rank of shields. \n\nThe phalanx therefore presented
    a shield wall and a mass of spear points to the enemy, making frontal assaults
    against it very difficult. \n\nIt also allowed a higher proportion of the soldiers
    to be actively engaged in combat at a given time (rather than just those in the
    front rank).\nBattles between two phalanxes usually took place in open, flat
    plains where it was easier to advance and stay in formation. \n\nRough terrain
    or hilly regions would have made it difficult to maintain a steady line and would
    have defeated the purpose of a phalanx. \n\nAs a result, battles between Greek
    city-states would not take place in just any location, nor would they be limited
    to sometimes obvious strategic points. \n\nRather, many times, the two opposing
    sides would find the most suitable piece of land where the conflict could be
    settled. \n\nTypically, the battle ended with one of the two fighting forces
    fleeing to safety.The phalanx usually advanced at a walking pace, although it
    is possible that they picked up speed during the last several yards. \n\nOne
    of the main reasons for this slow approach was to maintain formation. \n\nThe
    formation would be rendered useless if the phalanx was lost as the unit approached
    the enemy and could even become detrimental to the advancing unit, resulting
    in a weaker formation that was easier for an enemy force to break through. \n\nIf
    the hoplites of the phalanx were to pick up speed toward the latter part of the
    advance, it would have been for the purpose of gaining momentum against the enemy
    in the initial collision. \n\nHerodotus states of the Greeks at the Battle of
    Marathon, that \"They were the first Greeks we know of to charge their enemy
    at a run\". \n\nMany historians believe that this innovation was precipitated
    by their desire to minimize their losses from Persian archery. \n\nThe opposing
    sides would collide, possibly severing many of the spears of the row in front
    and killing the front part of the enemy army due to the bone-breaking collision.\nThe
    spears of a phalanx had spiked butts. \n\nIn battle, the back ranks used the
    spikes to finish fallen enemy soldiers.\n\n\n=== Pushing ===\n\nThe \"physical
    pushing match\" theory is one where the battle would rely on the valour of the
    men in the front line, whilst those in the rear maintained forward pressure on
    the front ranks with their shields, and the whole formation would consistently
    press forward trying to break the enemy formation. \n\nThis is the most widely
    accepted interpretation of the ancient sources thus when two phalanx formations
    engaged, the struggle essentially became a pushing match. \n\nHistorians such
    as Victor Davis Hanson point out that it is difficult to account for exceptionally
    deep phalanx formations unless they were necessary to facilitate the physical
    pushing depicted by this theory, as those behind the first two ranks could not
    take part in the actual spear thrusting.No Greek art ever depicts anything like
    a phalanx pushing match, so this hypothesis is a product of educated speculation
    rather than explicit testimony from contemporary sources and is far from being
    academically resolved. \n\nThe Greek term for \"push\" was used in the same metaphorical
    manner as the English word is (for example it was also used to describe the process
    of rhetorical arguments) and so does not necessarily describe a literal physical
    push, although it is possible that it did.\nFor instance, if Othismos were to
    accurately describe a physical pushing match, it would be logical to state that
    the deeper phalanx would always win an engagement since the physical strength
    of individuals would not compensate for even one additional rank on the enemy
    side. \n\nHowever, there are numerous examples of shallow phalanxes holding off
    an opponent. \n\nFor instance, at Delium in 424 BC, the Athenian left flank,
    a formation eight men deep, held off a formation of Thebans 25 deep without immediate
    collapse. \n\nIt is difficult with the physical pushing model to imagine eight
    men withstanding the pushing force of 25 opponents for a matter of seconds, let
    alone half the battle.\nSuch arguments have led to a wave of counter-criticism
    to physical shoving theorists. \n\nAdrian Goldsworthy, in his article \"The Othismos,
    Myths and Heresies: The nature of Hoplite Battle\", argues that the physical
    pushing match model does not fit with the average casualty figures of hoplite
    warfare nor the practical realities of moving large formations of men in battle.
    \n\nThis debate has yet to be resolved amongst scholars.\nPractical difficulties
    with this theory also include the fact that, in a shoving match, an eight-foot
    spear is too long to fight effectively or even parry attacks. \n\nSpears enable
    a formation of men to keep their enemies at a distance, parry attacks aimed at
    them and their comrades, and give the necessary reach to strike multiple men
    in the opposite formation. \n\nA pushing match would put enemies so close together
    that a quick stabbing with a knife would kill the front row almost instantly.
    \n\nThe crush of men would also prevent the formation from withdrawing or retreating,
    which would result in much higher casualties than is recorded. \n\nThe speed
    at which this would occur would also end the battle very quickly, instead of
    prolonging it for hours.\n\n\n=== Shields ===\n\nEach individual hoplite carried
    his shield on his left arm, protecting not only himself but also the soldier
    to the left. \n\nThis meant that the men at the extreme right of the phalanx
    were only half-protected. \n\nIn battle, opposing phalanxes would try to exploit
    this weakness by attempting to overlap the enemy's right flank. \n\nIt also meant
    that, in battle, a phalanx would tend to drift to the right (as hoplites sought
    to remain behind the shield of their neighbor). \n\nSome groups, such as the
    Spartans at Nemea, tried to use this phenomenon to their advantage. \n\nIn this
    case, the phalanx would sacrifice its left side, which typically consisted of
    allied troops, in an effort to overtake the enemy from the flank. \n\nIt is unlikely
    that this strategy worked very often, as it is not mentioned frequently in ancient
    Greek literature.There was a leader in each row of a phalanx, and a rear rank
    officer, the ouragos (meaning tail-leader), who kept order in the rear. \n\nThe
    hoplites had to trust their neighbors to protect them and in turn be willing
    to protect their neighbors; a phalanx was thus only as strong as its weakest
    elements. \n\nThe effectiveness of the phalanx therefore depended on how well
    the hoplites could maintain this formation in combat and how well they could
    stand their ground, especially when engaged against another phalanx. \n\nFor
    this reason, the formation was deliberately organized to group friends and family
    close together, thus providing a psychological incentive to support one's fellows,
    and a disincentive, through shame, to panic or attempt to flee. \n\nThe more
    disciplined and courageous the army, the more likely it was to win \u2013 often
    engagements between the various city-states of Greece would be resolved by one
    side fleeing before the battle. \n\nThe Greek word dynamis, the 'will to fight',
    expresses the drive that kept hoplites in formation.\n\nNow of those, who dare,
    abiding one beside another, to advance to the close fray, and the foremost champions,
    fewer die, and they save the people in the rear; but in men that fear, all excellence
    is lost. \n\nNo one could ever in words go through those several ills, which
    befall a man, if he has been actuated by cowardice. \n\nFor 'tis grievous to
    wound in the rear the back of a flying man in hostile war. \n\nShameful too is
    a corpse lying low in the dust, wounded behind in the back by the point of a
    spear.\n\n\n=== Hoplite armament ===\n\nEach hoplite provided his own equipment.
    \n\nThe primary hoplite weapon was a spear around 2.4 metres (7.9 ft) in length
    called a dory. \n\nAlthough accounts of its length vary, it is usually now believed
    to have been seven to nine feet long (~2.1\u20132.7 m). \n\nIt was held one-handed,
    with the other hand holding the hoplite's shield (aspis). \n\nThe spearhead was
    usually a curved leaf shape, while the rear of the spear had a spike called a
    sauroter ('lizard-killer') which was used to stand the spear in the ground (hence
    the name). \n\nIt was also used as a secondary weapon if the main shaft snapped
    or to kill enemies lying on the ground. \n\nThis was a common problem, especially
    for soldiers who were involved in the initial clash with the enemy. \n\nDespite
    the snapping of the spear, hoplites could easily switch to the sauroter without
    great consequence. \n\nThe rear ranks used the secondary end to finish off fallen
    opponents as the phalanx advanced over them.\nThroughout the hoplite era, the
    standard hoplite armour went through many cyclical changes. \n\nAn Archaic hoplite
    typically wore a bronze breastplate, a bronze helmet with cheekplates, as well
    as greaves and other armour. \n\nLater, in the classical period, the breastplate
    became less common, replaced instead with a corselet that some claim was made
    of linothorax (layers of linen glued together), or perhaps of leather, sometimes
    covered in whole or in part with overlapping metal scales. \n\nEventually, even
    greaves became less commonly used, although degrees of heavier armour remained,
    as attested by Xenophon as late as 401 BC.These changes reflected the balancing
    of mobility with protection, especially as cavalry became more prominent in the
    Peloponnesian War and the need to combat light troops, which were increasingly
    used to negate the hoplite's role as the primary force in battle. \n\nYet bronze
    armour remained in some form until the end of the hoplite era. \n\nSome archaeologists
    have pointed out that bronze armour does not actually provide as much protection
    from direct blows as more extensive corselet padding, and have suggested its
    continued use was a matter of status for those who could afford it. \n\nIn the
    classical Greek dialect, there is no word for swordsmen; yet hoplites also carried
    a short sword called the xiphos, used as a secondary weapon if the dory was broken
    or lost. \n\nSamples of the xiphos recovered at excavation sites were typically
    around 60 cm (24 in) in length. \n\nThese swords were double-edged and could
    therefore be used as a cutting and thrusting weapon. \n\nThese short swords were
    often used to stab or cut at the enemy's neck during close combat.Hoplites carried
    a circular shield called a hoplon (often referred to as an aspis) made from wood
    and covered in bronze, measuring roughly 1 metre (3.3 ft) in diameter. \n\nIt
    spanned from chin to knee and was very heavy (8\u201315 kg (18\u201333 lb)).
    \n\nThis medium-sized shield (fairly large for the period considering the average
    male height) was made possible partly by its dish-like shape, which allowed it
    to be supported with the rim on the shoulder. \n\nThis was quite an important
    feature of the shield, especially for the hoplites that remained in the latter
    ranks. \n\nWhile these soldiers continued to help press forward, they did not
    have the added burden of holding up their shield. \n\nBut the circular shield
    was not without its disadvantages. \n\nDespite its mobility, protective curve,
    and double straps the circular shape created gaps in the shield wall at both
    its top and bottom. (Top gaps were somewhat reduced by the one or two spears
    jutting out of the gap. \n\nIn order to minimize the bottom gaps, thick leather
    'curtains' were used but only by an [unknown] percentage of the hoplites, possibly
    mostly in the first row only since there were disadvantages as well: considerable
    added weight on an already heavy shield and a certain additional cost.) These
    gaps left parts of the hoplite exposed to potentially lethal spear thrusts and
    were a persistent vulnerability for hoplites controlling the front lines.\n\n\n===
    Phalangite armament ===\n\nThe phalanx of the Ancient Macedonian kingdom and
    the later Hellenistic successor states was a development of the hoplite phalanx.
    \n\nThe 'phalangites' were armed with a much longer spear, the sarissa, and less
    heavily armoured. \n\nThe sarissa was the pike used by the ancient Macedonian
    army. \n\nIts actual length is unknown, but apparently it was twice as long as
    the dory. \n\nThis makes it at least 14 feet (4.3 m), but 18 feet (5.5 m) appears
    more likely. (The cavalry xyston was 12.5 feet (3.8 m) by comparison.) The great
    length of the pike was balanced by a counterweight at the rear end, which also
    functioned as a butt-spike, allowing the sarissa to be planted into the ground.
    \n\nBecause of its great length, weight and different balance, a sarissa was
    wielded two-handed. \n\nThis meant that the aspis was no longer a practical defence.
    \n\nInstead, the phalangites strapped a smaller pelte shield (usually reserved
    for peltasts, light skirmishers) to their left forearm. \n\nRecent theories,
    including examination of ancient frescoes depicting full sets of weapons and
    armor, claim that the shields used were actually larger than the pelte but smaller
    than the aspis, hanging by leather strap(s) from the left shoulder or from both
    shoulders. \n\nThe shield would retain handling straps in the inner curve, to
    be handled like a (smaller) aspis if the fight progressed to sword-wielding.
    \n\nAlthough in both shield size assumptions this reduced the shield wall, the
    extreme length of the spear kept the enemy at a greater distance, as the pikes
    of the first three to five ranks could all be brought to bear in front of the
    front row. \n\nThis pike had to be held underhand, as the shield would have obscured
    the soldier's vision had it been held overhead. \n\nIt would also be very hard
    to remove a sarissa from anything it stuck in (the earth, shields, and soldiers
    of the opposition) if it were thrust downwards, due to its length. \n\nThe Macedonian
    phalanx was much less able to form a shield wall, but the lengthened spears would
    have compensated for this. \n\nSuch a phalanx formation also reduced the likelihood
    that battles would degenerate into a pushing match.\n\n\n== Deployment and combat
    ==\n\n=== Phalanx composition and strength ===\n\nThe basic combat element of
    the Greek armies was either the stichos (meaning 'file'; usually 8\u201316 men
    strong) or the enomotia (meaning 'sworn' and made up by 2\u20134 stich\u0153,
    totaling up to 32 men), both led by a dim\u0153rites who was assisted by a decadarchos
    and two decaster\u0153 (sing. decasteros). \n\nFour to a maximum of 32 enomoti\xE6
    (depending on the era in question or the city) were forming a lochos led by a
    lochagos, who in this way was in command of initially 100 hoplites to a maximum
    of c. 500 in the late Hellenistic armies. \n\nHere, it has to be noted that the
    military manuals of Asclepiodotus and Aelian use the term lochos to denote a
    file in the phalanx. \n\nA taxis (mora for the Spartans) was the greatest standard
    hoplitic formation of 500 to 1500 men, led by a strategos (general). \n\nThe
    entire army, a total of several taxeis or mor\xE6 was led by a generals' council.
    \n\nThe commander-in-chief was usually called a polemarchos or a strategos autocrator.\n\n\n===
    Phalanx front and depth ===\n\nHoplite phalanxes usually deployed in ranks of
    eight men or more deep; the Macedonian phalanxes were usually 16 men deep, sometimes
    reported to have been arrayed 32 men deep. \n\nThere are some notable extremes;
    at the battles of Leuctra and Mantinea, the Theban general Epaminondas arranged
    the left wing of the phalanx into a \"hammerhead\" of 50 ranks of elite hoplites
    deep (see below) and when depth was less important, phalanxes just four deep
    are recorded, as at the battle of Marathon.The phalanx depth could vary depending
    on the needs of the moment and plans of the general. \n\nWhile the phalanx was
    in march, an eis bathos formation (loose, meaning literally 'in depth') was adopted
    in order to move more freely and maintain order. \n\nThis was also the initial
    battle formation as, in addition, it permitted friendly units to pass through
    whether assaulting or retreating. \n\nIn this status, the phalanx had twice the
    normal depth and each hoplite had to occupy about 1.8\u20132 metres (5 ft 11
    in\u20136 ft 7 in) in width. \n\nWhen enemy infantry was approaching, a rapid
    switch to the pycne (spelled also pucne) formation (dense or tight formation)
    was necessary. \n\nIn that case, each man's space was halved (0.9\u20131 metre
    or 2 feet 11 inches\u20133 feet 3 inches in width) and the formation depth returned
    to normal. \n\nAn even denser formation, the synaspismos or sunaspismos (ultra-tight
    or locked shields formation), was used when the phalanx was expected to experience
    extra pressure, intense missile volleys or frontal cavalry charges. \n\nIn synaspismos,
    the rank depth was half that of a normal phalanx and the width each man occupied
    was as small as 0.45 metres (1.5 ft).\n\n\n=== Stages of combat ===\n\nSeveral
    stages in hoplite combat can be defined:\nEphodos: The hoplites stop singing
    their p\xE6anes (battle hymns) and move towards the enemy, gradually picking
    up pace and momentum. \n\nIn the instants before impact, war cries (alalagm\u0153,
    sing. alalagmos) would be made. \n\nNotable war cries were the Athenian (eleleleleu!
    eleleleleu!) and the Macedonian (alalalalai! alalalalai!) alalagm\u0153.\nKrousis:
    The opposing phalanxes meet each other almost simultaneously along their front.
    \nDoratismos: Repeated, rapid spear thrusts in order to disrupt the enemy formation.
    \n\nThe use of long spears would keep enemies apart as well as allow men in a
    row to assist their comrades next to them. \n\nThe prodding could also open up
    a man to allow a comrade to spear him. \n\nToo hard prodding could get a spear
    stuck in a shield, which would necessitate someone in the back to lend his to
    the now-disarmed man.\nOthismos: Literally 'pushing' after most spears have been
    broken, the hoplites begin to push with their spears and spear shafts against
    their opponents' shields. \n\nThis could be the longest phase.Pararrhexis: 'Breaching'
    the opposing phalanx, the enemy formation shatters and the battle ends. \n\nCavalry
    would be used at this point to mop up the scattered enemy.\n\n\n== Tactics ==\n\nThe
    early history of the phalanx is largely one of combat between hoplite armies
    from competing Greek city-states. \n\nThe usual result was rather identical,
    inflexible formations pushing against each other until one broke. \n\nThe potential
    of the phalanx to achieve something more was demonstrated at Battle of Marathon
    (490 BC). \n\nFacing the much larger army of Darius I, the Athenians thinned
    out their phalanx and consequently lengthened their front, to avoid being outflanked.
    \n\nHowever, even a reduced-depth phalanx proved unstoppable to the lightly armed
    Persian infantry. \n\nAfter routing the Persian wings, the hoplites on the Athenian
    wings wheeled inwards, destroying the elite troop at the Persian centre, resulting
    in a crushing victory for Athens. \n\nThroughout the Greco-Persian Wars the hoplite
    phalanx was to prove superior to the Persian infantry (e.g. the battles of Thermopylae
    and Plataea).\nPerhaps the most prominent example of the phalanx's evolution
    was the oblique order, made famous in the Battle of Leuctra. \n\nThere, the Theban
    general Epaminondas thinned out the right flank and centre of his phalanx, and
    deepened his left flank to an unheard-of 50 men deep. \n\nIn doing so, Epaminondas
    reversed the convention by which the right flank of the phalanx was strongest.
    \n\nThis allowed the Thebans to assault in strength the elite Spartan troops
    on the right flank of the opposing phalanx. \n\nMeanwhile, the centre and right
    flank of the Theban line were echeloned back, from the opposing phalanx, keeping
    the weakened parts of the formation from being engaged. \n\nOnce the Spartan
    right had been routed by the Theban left, the remainder of the Spartan line also
    broke. \n\nThus, by localising the attacking power of the hoplites, Epaminondas
    was able to defeat an enemy previously thought invincible.\nPhilip II of Macedon
    spent several years in Thebes as a hostage, and paid attention to Epaminondas'
    innovations. \n\nOn return to his homeland, he raised a revolutionary new infantry
    force, which was to change the face of the Greek world. \n\nPhilip's phalangites
    were the first force of professional soldiers seen in Ancient Greece apart from
    Sparta. \n\nThey were armed with longer spears (the sarissa) and were drilled
    more thoroughly in more evolved, complicated tactics and manoeuvres. \n\nMore
    importantly, though, Philip's phalanx was part of a multi-faceted, combined force
    that included a variety of skirmishers and cavalry, most notably the famous Companion
    cavalry. \n\nThe Macedonian phalanx now was used to pin the centre of the enemy
    line, while cavalry and more mobile infantry struck at the foe's flanks. \n\nIts
    supremacy over the more static armies fielded by the Greek city-states was shown
    at the Battle of Chaeronea, where Philip II's army crushed the allied Theban
    and Athenian phalanxes.\n\n\n== Weaknesses ==\n\nThe hoplite phalanx was weakest
    when facing an enemy fielding lighter and more flexible troops without its own
    such supporting troops. \n\nAn example of this would be the Battle of Lechaeum,
    where an Athenian contingent led by Iphicrates routed an entire Spartan mora
    (a unit of anywhere from 500 to 900 hoplites). \n\nThe Athenian force had a considerable
    proportion of light missile troops armed with javelins and bows that wore down
    the Spartans with repeated attacks, causing disarray in the Spartan ranks and
    an eventual rout when they spotted Athenian heavy infantry reinforcements trying
    to flank them by boat.\nThe Macedonian phalanx had weaknesses similar to its
    hoplitic predecessor. \n\nTheoretically indestructible from the front, its flanks
    and rear were very vulnerable, and once engaged it may not easily disengage or
    redeploy to face a threat from those directions. \n\nThus, a phalanx facing non-phalangite
    formations required some sort of protection on its flanks\u2014lighter or at
    least more mobile infantry, cavalry, etc. \n\nThis was shown at the Battle of
    Magnesia, where, once the Seleucid supporting cavalry elements were driven off,
    the phalanx was static and unable to go on the offensive against its Roman opponents
    (although they continued to resist stoutly and attempted a fighting withdrawal
    under a hail of Roman missiles, until the elephants posted on their flanks panicked
    and disrupted their formation).\nThe Macedonian phalanx could also lose its cohesion
    without proper coordination or while moving through broken terrain; doing so
    could create gaps between individual blocks/syntagmata, or could prevent a solid
    front within those sub-units as well, causing other sections of the line to bunch
    up. \n\nIn this event, as in the battles of Cynoscephalae and Pydna, the phalanx
    became vulnerable to attacks by more flexible units\u2014such as Roman legionary
    centuries, which were able to avoid the sarissae and engage in hand-to-hand combat
    with the phalangites.\nAnother important area that must be considered concerns
    the psychological tendencies of the hoplites. \n\nBecause the strength of a phalanx
    depended on the ability of the hoplites to maintain their frontline, it was crucial
    that a phalanx be able to quickly and efficiently replace fallen soldiers in
    the front ranks. \n\nIf a phalanx failed to do this in a structured manner, the
    opposing phalanx would have an opportunity to breach the line which, many times,
    would lead to a quick defeat. \n\nThis then implies that the hoplites ranks closer
    to the front must be mentally prepared to replace their fallen comrade and adapt
    to his new position without disrupting the structure of the frontline.Finally,
    most of the phalanx-centric armies tended to lack supporting echelons behind
    the main line of battle. \n\nThis meant that breaking through the line of battle
    or compromising one of its flanks often ensured victory.\n\n\n== Classical decline
    and post-classical use ==\n\nAfter reaching its zenith in the conquests of Alexander
    the Great, the phalanx began a slow decline, as Macedonian successor states declined.
    \n\nThe combined arms tactics used by Alexander and his father were gradually
    replaced by a return to the simpler frontal charge tactics of the hoplite phalanx.
    \n\nThe expense of the supporting arms and cavalry, and the widespread use of
    mercenaries, caused the Diadochi to rely on phalanx vs. phalanx tactics during
    the Wars of the Diadochi.\nThe decline of the Diadochi and the phalanx was linked
    with the rise of Rome and the Roman legions from the 3rd century BC. \n\nThe
    Battle of the Caudine Forks showed the clumsiness of the Roman phalanx against
    the Samnites. \n\nThe Romans had originally employed the phalanx themselves but
    gradually evolved more flexible tactics. \n\nThe result was the three-line Roman
    legion of the middle period of the Roman Republic, the Manipular System. \n\nRomans
    used a phalanx for their third military line, the triarii. \n\nThese were veteran
    reserve troops armed with the hastae or spear. \n\nRome conquered most of the
    Macedonian successor states. \n\nAlso the various Greek city-states and leagues.
    \n\nAs these states ceased to exist, so did the armies which used the traditional
    phalanx. \n\nSubsequently, troops from these regions were equipped, trained and
    fought using the Roman model.\nA phalanx formation called the phoulkon appeared
    in the late Roman army and Byzantine army. \n\nIt had characteristics of the
    classical Greek and Hellenistic phalanxes, but was more flexible. \n\nIt was
    used against cavalry more than infantry.\nHowever, the phalanx did not totally
    disappear. \n\nIn some battles between the Roman army and Hellenistic phalanxes,
    such as Pydna (168 BC), Cynoscephalae (197 BC) and Magnesia (190 BC), the phalanx
    performed well. \n\nIt even drove back the Roman infantry. \n\nHowever, at Cynoscephalae
    and Magnesia, failure to defend the flanks of the phalanx led to defeat. \n\nAt
    Pydna, the phalanx lost cohesion when pursuing retreating Roman soldiers. \n\nThis
    allowed the Romans to penetrate the formation. \n\nThen, Roman close combat skills
    proved decisive. \n\nThe historian Polybius details the effectiveness of the
    Roman legion against the phalanx. \n\nHe deduces that the Romans refused to fight
    the phalanx where the phalanx was effective, Romans offered battle only when
    a legion could exploit the clumsiness and immobility of a phalanx.\n\nSpear-armed
    troops continued to be important elements in many armies until reliable firearms
    became available. \n\nThese did not necessarily fight as a phalanx. \n\nFor example,
    compare the classical phalanx and late medieval pike formations.Military historians
    have suggested that the Scots under William Wallace and Robert the Bruce consciously
    imitated the Hellenistic phalanx to produce the Scots 'hedgehog' or schiltron.
    \n\nHowever, long spears might have been used by Picts and others in Scotlands'
    Early Middle Ages. \n\nPrior to 1066, long spear tactics (also found in North
    Wales) might have been part of irregular warfare in Britain. \n\nThe Scots used
    imported French pikes and dynamic tactics at the Battle of Flodden. \n\nHowever,
    Flodden found the Scots pitted against effective light artillery, while advancing
    over bad ground. \n\nThe combination disorganised the Scotts phalanxes and permitted
    effective attacks by English longbowmen, and soldiers wielding shorter, handier
    polearms called bills. \n\nSome contemporary sources might say that the bills
    cut off the heads of Scots pikes.\nThe pike was briefly reconsidered as a weapon
    by European armies in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. \n\nIt could protect
    riflemen, whose slower rate of fire made them vulnerable. \n\nA collapsible pike
    was invented but never issued. \n\nThe Confederate Army considered these for
    the American Civil War. \n\nSome were even manufactured but probably were never
    issued. \n\nPikes were manufactured during World War II as \"Croft's Pikes\".\nWhile
    obsolete in military practice, the phalanx remained in use as a metaphor of warriors
    moving forward as a single united block. \n\nThis metaphor inspired several 20th-century
    political movements, notably the Spanish Falange and its ideology of Falangism.\nThe
    Byzantines continued and improved the use of the classical Greek phalanx alongside
    the Macedonian-style phalanx. \n\nThe latter was based on a model that Alexander
    himself had created and had tried to give more importance to the skirmishers
    and cavalry, yet it never saw action until the Byzantines adopted the model that
    rely in a mixture of many units sometimes. \n\nMany writers of the age describe
    the spear as being a sarissa yet it was a meter short than the original sarissa
    and had being modified by the time, yet the term for the long spear remained
    alongside with its other names.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phalanx"

  descriptionText: "\n\nCOSTAL CARTILAGE(S)\n\n\nThe costal cartilages are bars of
    hyaline cartilage that serve to prolong the ribs forward and contribute to the
    elasticity of the walls of the thorax. \n\nCostal cartilage is only found at
    the anterior ends of the ribs, providing medial extension.\n\n\n== Differences
    from Ribs 1-12 ==\n\nThe first seven pairs are connected with the sternum; the
    next three are each articulated with the lower border of the cartilage of the
    preceding rib; the last two have pointed extremities, which end in the wall of
    the abdomen.Like the ribs, the costal cartilages vary in their length, breadth,
    and direction. \n\nThey increase in length from the first to the seventh, then
    gradually decrease to the twelfth.\n\nTheir breadth, as well as that of the intervals
    between them, diminishes from the first to the last. \n\nThey are broad at their
    attachments to the ribs, and taper toward their sternal extremities, excepting
    the first two, which are of the same breadth throughout, and the sixth, seventh,
    and eighth, which are enlarged where their margins are in contact.\n\nThey also
    vary in direction: the first descends a little to the sternum, the second is
    horizontal, the third ascends slightly, while the others are angular, following
    the course of the ribs for a short distance, and then ascending to the sternum
    or preceding cartilage.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nEach costal cartilage presents
    two surfaces, two borders, and two extremities.\n\n\n=== Surfaces ===\n\nThe
    anterior surface is convex, and looks forward and upward: that of the first gives
    attachment to the costoclavicular ligament and the subclavius muscle; those of
    the first six or seven at their sternal ends, to the pectoralis major. \n\nThe
    others are covered by, and give partial attachment to, some of the flat muscles
    of the abdomen.\n\nThe posterior surface is concave, and directed backward and
    downward; that of the first gives attachment to the sternothyroideus, those of
    the third to the sixth inclusive to the transversus thoracis muscle, and the
    six or seven inferior ones to the transversus abdominis muscle and the diaphragm.\n\n\n===
    Borders ===\n\nOf the two borders the superior is concave, the inferior convex;
    they afford attachment to the intercostales interni: the upper border of the
    sixth gives attachment also to the pectoralis major.\n\nThe inferior borders
    of the sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth cartilages present heel-like projections
    at the points of greatest convexity. \n\nThese projections carry smooth oblong
    facets which articulate with facets on slight projections from the upper borders
    of the seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth cartilages, respectively.\n\n\n=== Interchondral
    articulations ===\n\nThe interchondral articulations are the joints formed between
    the costal cartilages of the ribs. \n\nThe contiguous borders of the sixth, seventh,
    and eighth, and sometimes those of the ninth and tenth, costal cartilages articulate
    with each other by small, smooth, oblong facets. \n\nEach articulation is enclosed
    in a thin articular capsule, lined by synovial membrane and strengthened laterally
    and medially by ligamentous fibers (interchondral ligaments) which pass from
    one cartilage to the other. \n\nSometimes the fifth costal cartilages, more rarely
    the ninth and tenth, articulate by their lower borders with the adjoining cartilages
    by small oval facets; more frequently the connection is by a few ligamentous
    fibers.\n\n\n=== Extremities ===\n\nThe lateral end of each cartilage is continuous
    with the osseous tissue of the rib to which it belongs.\n\nThe medial end of
    the first is continuous with the sternum; the medial ends of the six succeeding
    ones are rounded and are received into shallow concavities on the lateral margins
    of the sternum.\n\nThe medial ends of the eighth, ninth, and tenth costal cartilages
    are pointed, and are connected each with the cartilage immediately above.\n\nThose
    of the eleventh and twelfth are pointed and free.\n\n\n== Clinical significance
    ==\n\nIn old age, the costal cartilages are prone to superficial ossification.In
    costochondritis and Tietze syndrome, inflammation of the costal cartilage occurs.
    \n\nThis is a common cause of chest pain.Severe trauma may lead to fracture of
    the costal cartilage. \n\nSuch injuries often go unnoticed during x-ray scans,
    but can be diagnosed with CT scans. \n\nSurgery is typically used to fix the
    costal cartilage back onto either the rib or sternum.Costal cartilage may be
    harvested for reparative use elsewhere in the body. \n\nWhilst this is typically
    conducted using a general anaesthetic, IV sedation can also be used. \n\nThe
    procedure presents a minor risk of pleural tear.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costal_cartilage"

  descriptionText: "\n\nMANDIBLE\n\n\nIn anatomy, the mandible, lower jaw or jawbone
    is the largest, strongest and lowest bone in the human facial skeleton. \n\nIt
    forms the lower jaw and holds the lower teeth in place. \n\nThe mandible sits
    beneath the maxilla. \n\nIt is the only movable bone of the skull (discounting
    the ossicles of the middle ear). \n\nIt is connected to the temporal bones by
    the temporomandibular joints.\n\nThe bone is formed in the fetus from a fusion
    of the left and right mandibular prominences, and the point where these sides
    join, the mandibular symphysis, is still visible as a faint ridge in the midline.
    \n\nLike other symphyses in the body, this is a midline articulation where the
    bones are joined by fibrocartilage, but this articulation fuses together in early
    childhood.\n\nThe word \"mandible\" derives from the Latin word mandibula, \"jawbone\"
    (literally \"one used for chewing\"), from mandere \"to chew\" and -bula (instrumental
    suffix).\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\n=== Components ===\n\n\nThe mandible consists
    of:\n\nThe body, found at the front\nA ramus on the left and the right, the rami
    rise up from the body of the mandible and meet with the body at the angle of
    the mandible or the gonial angle.\n\n\n==== Body ====\n\nThe body of the mandible
    is curved, and the front part gives structure to the chin. \n\nIt has two surfaces
    and two borders. \n\nFrom the outside, the mandible is marked in the midline
    by a faint ridge, indicating the mandibular symphysis, the line of junction of
    the two halves of the mandible, which fuse at about one year of age. \n\nThis
    ridge divides below and encloses a triangular eminence, the mental protuberance
    (the chin), the base of which is depressed in the center but raised on both sides
    to form the mental tubercle. \n\nJust above this, on both sides, the mentalis
    muscles attach to a depression called the incisive fossa. \n\nBelow the second
    premolar tooth, on both sides, midway between the upper and lower borders of
    the body, are the mental foramen, for the passage of the mental vessels and nerve.
    \n\nRunning backward and upward from each mental tubercle is a faint ridge, the
    oblique line, which is continuous with the anterior border of the ramus. \n\nAttached
    to this is the masseter muscle, the depressor labii inferioris and depressor
    anguli oris, and the platysma (from below).From the inside, the mandible appears
    concave. \n\nNear the lower part of the symphysis is a pair of laterally placed
    spines, termed the mental spines, which give origin to the genioglossus. \n\nImmediately
    below these is a second pair of spines, or more frequently a median ridge or
    impression, for the origin of the geniohyoid. \n\nIn some cases, the mental spines
    are fused to form a single eminence, in others they are absent and their position
    is indicated merely by an irregularity of the surface. \n\nAbove the mental spines,
    a median foramen and furrow are sometimes seen; they mark the line of union of
    the halves of the bone. \n\nBelow the mental spines, on either side of the middle
    line, is an oval depression for the attachment of the anterior belly of the digastric.
    \n\nExtending upward and backward on either side from the lower part of the symphysis
    is the mylohyoid line, which gives origin to the mylohyoid muscle; the posterior
    part of this line, near the alveolar margin, gives attachment to a small part
    of the constrictor pharyngis superior, and to the pterygomandibular raphe. \n\nAbove
    the anterior part of this line is a smooth triangular area against which the
    sublingual gland rests, and below the hinder part, an oval fossa for the submandibular
    gland.\nBorders\n\nThe superior or alveolar border, wider behind than in front,
    is hollowed into cavities, for the reception of the teeth; these cavities are
    sixteen in number and vary in depth and size according to the teeth which they
    contain. \n\nTo the outer lip of the superior border, on either side, the buccinator
    is attached as far forward as the first molar tooth.\nThe inferior border is
    rounded, longer than the superior, and thicker in front than behind; at the point
    where it joins the lower border of the ramus a shallow groove; for the facial
    artery, may be present.\n\n\n==== Ramus ====\n\nThe ramus (Latin: branch) of
    the human mandible has four sides, two surfaces, four borders, and two processes.\nOn
    the outside, the ramus is flat and marked by oblique ridges at its lower part.
    \n\nIt gives attachment throughout nearly the whole of its extent to the masseter
    muscle.On the inside at the center there is an oblique mandibular foramen, for
    the entrance of the inferior alveolar vessels and nerve. \n\nThe margin of this
    opening is irregular; it presents in front a prominent ridge, surmounted by a
    sharp spine, the lingula of the mandible, which gives attachment to the sphenomandibular
    ligament; at its lower and back part is a notch from which the mylohyoid groove
    runs obliquely downward and forward, and lodges the mylohyoid vessels and nerve.
    \n\nBehind this groove is a rough surface, for the insertion of the medial pterygoid
    muscle. \n\nThe mandibular canal runs obliquely downward and forward in the ramus,
    and then horizontally forward in the body, where it is placed under the alveoli
    and communicates with them by small openings. \n\nOn arriving at the incisor
    teeth, it turns back to communicate with the mental foramen, giving off two small
    canals which run to the cavities containing the incisor teeth. \n\nIn the posterior
    two-thirds of the bone the canal is situated nearer the internal surface of the
    mandible; and in the anterior third, nearer its external surface. \n\nIt contains
    the inferior alveolar vessels and nerve, from which branches are distributed
    to the teeth.\nBorders\n\nThe lower border of the ramus is thick, straight, and
    continuous with the inferior border of the body of the bone. \n\nAt its junction
    with the posterior border is the angle of the mandible, which may be either inverted
    or everted and is marked by rough, oblique ridges on each side, for the attachment
    of the masseter laterally, and the medial pterygoid muscle medially; the stylomandibular
    ligament is attached to the angle between these muscles. \n\nThe anterior border
    is thin above, thicker below, and continuous with the oblique line.\nThe region
    where the lower border meets the posterior border is the angle of the mandible,
    often called the gonial angle.\nThe posterior border is thick, smooth, rounded,
    and covered by the parotid gland. \n\nThe upper border is thin, and is surmounted
    by two processes, the coronoid in front and the condyloid behind, separated by
    a deep concavity, the mandibular notch.Processes\n\nThe coronoid process is a
    thin, triangular eminence, which is flattened from side to side and varies in
    shape and size.\nThe condyloid process is thicker than the coronoid, and consists
    of two portions: the mandibular condyle, and the constricted portion which supports
    it, the neck. \n\nThe condyle is the most superior part of the mandible and is
    part of the temporomandibular joint.\nThe mandibular notch, separating the two
    processes, is a deep semilunar depression and is crossed by the masseteric vessels
    and nerve.\n\n\n=== Foramina ===\n\nThe mandible has two main holes (foramina),
    found on both its right and left sides:\n\nThe mandibular foramen, is above the
    mandibular angle in the middle of each ramus.\nThe mental foramen sits on either
    side of the mental protuberance (chin) on the body of mandible, usually inferior
    to the apices of the mandibular first and second premolars. \n\nAs mandibular
    growth proceeds in young children, the mental foramen alters in direction of
    its opening from anterior to posterosuperior. \n\nThe mental foramen allows the
    entrance of the mental nerve and blood vessels into the mandibular canal.\n\n\n===
    Nerves ===\n\nThe inferior alveolar nerve, a branch of the mandibular nerve,
    (a major division of the trigeminal nerve), enters the mandibular foramen and
    runs forward in the mandibular canal, supplying sensation to the teeth. \n\nAt
    the mental foramen, the nerve divides into two terminal branches: incisive and
    mental nerves. \n\nThe incisive nerve runs forward in the mandible and supplies
    the anterior teeth. \n\nThe mental nerve exits the mental foramen and supplies
    sensation to the lower lip.\n\n\n=== Variation ===\n\nMales generally have squarer,
    stronger, and larger mandibles than females. \n\nThe mental protuberance is more
    pronounced in males but can be visualized and palpated in females.Rarely, a bifid
    inferior alveolar nerve may be present, in which case a second mandibular foramen,
    more inferiorly placed, exists and can be detected by noting a doubled mandibular
    canal on a radiograph.\n\n\n== Development ==\n\nThe mandible forms as a bone
    (ossifies) over time from a left and right piece of cartilage, called Meckel's
    cartilage.\nThese cartilages form the cartilaginous bar of the mandibular arch.
    \n\nNear the head, they are connected with the ear capsules, and they meet at
    the lower end at the mandibular symphysis, a fusion point between the two bones,
    by mesodermal tissue. \n\nThey run forward immediately below the condyles and
    then, bending downward, lie in a groove near the lower border of the bone; in
    front of the canine tooth they incline upward to the symphysis. \n\nFrom the
    proximal end of each cartilage the malleus and incus, two of the bones of the
    middle ear, are developed; the next succeeding portion, as far as the lingula,
    is replaced by fibrous tissue, which persists to form the sphenomandibular ligament.\n\nBetween
    the lingula and the canine tooth the cartilage disappears, while the portion
    of it below and behind the incisor teeth becomes ossified and incorporated with
    this part of the mandible.\n\nAbout the sixth week of fetal life, intramembranous
    ossification takes place in the membrane covering the outer surface of the ventral
    end of Meckel's cartilage, and each half of the bone is formed from a single
    center which appears, near the mental foramen.\n\nBy the tenth week, the portion
    of Meckel's cartilage which lies below and behind the incisor teeth is surrounded
    and invaded by the dermal bone (also known as the membrane bone). \n\nSomewhat
    later, accessory nuclei of cartilage make their appearance:\n\n-a wedge-shaped
    nucleus in the condyloid process and extending downward through the ramus;\n-a
    small strip along the anterior border of the coronoid process;\n-smaller nuclei
    in the front part of both alveolar walls and along the front of the lower border
    of the bone.These accessory nuclei possess no separate ossific centers but are
    invaded by the surrounding dermal bone and undergo absorption. \n\nThe inner
    alveolar border, usually described as arising from a separate ossific center
    (splenial center), is formed in the human mandible by an ingrowth from the main
    mass of the bone.\n\nAt birth the bone consists of two parts, united by a fibrous
    symphysis, in which ossification takes place during the first year.\t\t\n\n\n===
    Aging ===\n\nAt birth, the body of the bone is a mere shell, containing the sockets
    of the two incisor, the canine, and the two deciduous molar teeth, imperfectly
    partitioned off from one another. \n\nThe mandibular canal is of large size and
    runs near the lower border of the bone; the mental foramen opens beneath the
    socket of the first deciduous molar tooth. \n\nThe angle is obtuse (175\xB0),
    and the condyloid portion is nearly in line with the body. \n\nThe coronoid process
    is of comparatively large size, and projects above the level of the condyle.\n\nAfter
    birth, the two segments of the bone become joined at the symphysis, from below
    upward, in the first year; but a trace of separation may be visible in the beginning
    of the second year, near the alveolar margin. \n\nThe body becomes elongated
    in its whole length, but more especially behind the mental foramen, to provide
    space for the three additional teeth developed in this part. \n\nThe depth of
    the body increases owing to increased growth of the alveolar part, to afford
    room for the roots of the teeth, and by thickening of the subdental portion which
    enables the jaw to withstand the powerful action of the masticatory muscles;
    but, the alveolar portion is the deeper of the two, and, consequently, the chief
    part of the body lies above the oblique line. \n\nThe mandibular canal, after
    the second dentition, is situated just above the level of the mylohyoid line;
    and the mental foramen occupies the position usual to it in the adult. \n\nThe
    angle becomes less obtuse, owing to the separation of the jaws by the teeth;
    about the fourth year it is 140\xB0.\n\nIn the adult, the alveolar and subdental
    portions of the body are usually of equal depth. \n\nThe mental foramen opens
    midway between the upper and lower borders of the bone, and the mandibular canal
    runs nearly parallel with the mylohyoid line. \n\nThe ramus is almost vertical
    in direction, the angle measuring from 110\xB0 to 120\xB0, also the adult condyle
    is higher than the coronoid process and the sigmoid notch becomes deeper.\n\nIn
    old age, the bone can become greatly reduced in volume where there is a loss
    of teeth, and consequent resorption of the alveolar process and interalveolar
    septa. \n\nConsequently, the chief part of the bone is below the oblique line.
    \n\nThe mandibular canal, with the mental foramen opening from it, is closer
    to the alveolar border. \n\nThe ramus is oblique in direction, the angle measures
    about 140\xB0, and the neck of the condyle is more or less bent backward.\n\nChanges
    in the mandible with age\n\t\t\n\t\t\n== Function ==\n\nThe mandible forms the
    lower jaw and holds the lower teeth in place. \n\nIt articulates with the left
    and right temporal bones at the temporomandibular joints.\n\nCondyloid process,
    superior (upper) and posterior projection from the ramus, which makes the temporomandibular
    joint with the temporal bone\nCoronoid process, superior and anterior projection
    from the ramus. \n\nThis provides attachment to the temporal muscle.Teeth sit
    in the upper part of the body of the mandible.\n\nThe frontmost part of teeth
    is more narrow and holds front teeth.\nThe back part holds wider and flatter
    teeth primarily for chewing food. \n\nThese teeth also often have wide and sometimes
    deep grooves on the surfaces.\n\n\n== Clinical significance ==\n\n=== Fracture
    ===\n\n\nOne fifth of facial injuries involve a mandibular fracture. \n\nMandibular
    fractures are often accompanied by a 'twin fracture' on the opposite side. \n\nThere
    is no universally accepted treatment protocol, as there is no consensus on the
    choice of techniques in a particular anatomical shape of mandibular fracture
    clinic. \n\nA common treatment involves attachment of metal plates to the fracture
    to assist in healing.\nThe mandible may be dislocated anteriorly (to the front)
    and inferiorly (downwards) but very rarely posteriorly (backwards). \n\nThe articular
    disk of the temporomandibular joint prevents the mandible from moving posteriorly,
    making the condylar neck particularly vulnerable to fractures.\n\nThe mandibular
    alveolar process can become resorbed when completely edentulous in the mandibular
    arch (occasionally noted also in partially edentulous cases). \n\nThis resorption
    can occur to such an extent that the mental foramen is virtually on the superior
    border of the mandible, instead of opening on the anterior surface, changing
    its relative position. \n\nHowever, the more inferior body of the mandible is
    not affected and remains thick and rounded. \n\nWith age and tooth loss, the
    alveolar process is absorbed so that the mandibular canal becomes nearer the
    superior border. \n\nSometimes with excessive alveolar process absorption, the
    mandibular canal disappears entirely and leaves the inferior alveolar nerve without
    its bony protection, although it is still covered by soft tissue.\n\n\n=== Forensic
    medicine ===\n\nWhen remains of humans are found, the mandible is one of the
    common findings, sometimes the only bone found. \n\nSkilled experts can estimate
    the age of the human upon death because the mandible changes over a person's
    life.\n\n\n== Other vertebrates ==\n\n\nIn lobe-finned fishes and the early fossil
    tetrapods, the bone homologous to the mandible of mammals is merely the largest
    of several bones in the lower jaw. \n\nIn such animals, it is referred to as
    the dentary bone or os dentale, and forms the body of the outer surface of the
    jaw. \n\nIt is bordered below by a number of splenial bones, while the angle
    of the jaw is formed by a lower angular bone and a suprangular bone just above
    it. \n\nThe inner surface of the jaw is lined by a prearticular bone, while the
    articular bone forms the articulation with the skull proper. \n\nFinally a set
    of three narrow coronoid bones lie above the prearticular bone. \n\nAs the name
    implies, the majority of the teeth are attached to the dentary, but there are
    commonly also teeth on the coronoid bones, and sometimes on the prearticular
    as well.This complex primitive pattern has, however, been simplified to various
    degrees in the great majority of vertebrates, as bones have either fused or vanished
    entirely. \n\nIn teleosts, only the dentary, articular, and angular bones remain,
    while in living amphibians, the dentary is accompanied only by the prearticular,
    and, in salamanders, one of the coronoids. \n\nThe lower jaw of reptiles has
    only a single coronoid and splenial, but retains all the other primitive bones
    except the prearticular and the periosteum.While, in birds, these various bones
    have fused into a single structure, in mammals most of them have disappeared,
    leaving an enlarged dentary as the only remaining bone in the lower jaw \u2013
    the mandible. \n\nAs a result of this, the primitive jaw articulation, between
    the articular and quadrate bones, has been lost, and replaced with an entirely
    new articulation between the mandible and the temporal bone. \n\nAn intermediate
    stage can be seen in some therapsids, in which both points of articulation are
    present. \n\nAside from the dentary, only few other bones of the primitive lower
    jaw remain in mammals; the former articular and quadrate bones survive as the
    malleus and the incus of the middle ear.\n\nFinally, the cartilaginous fish,
    such as sharks, do not have any of the bones found in the lower jaw of other
    vertebrates. \n\nInstead, their lower jaw is composed of a cartilagenous structure
    homologous with the Meckel's cartilage of other groups. \n\nThis also remains
    a significant element of the jaw in some primitive bony fish, such as sturgeons.\n\n\n==
    Society and culture ==\n\nIn the Book of Judges, Samson used a donkey's jawbone
    to kill a thousand Philistines.\n\nDental remains of Adolf Hitler including part
    of a mandible with teeth were the solitary physical evidence used to confirm
    his death in 1945. \n\nThe Soviet account published in 1968 describes and photographically
    depicts the jawbone as being broken off at the alveolar process.\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandible"

  descriptionText: "\n\nMETACARPAL BONES\n\n\nIn human anatomy, the metacarpal bones
    or metacarpus, form the intermediate part of the skeletal hand located between
    the phalanges of the fingers and the carpal bones of the wrist which forms the
    connection to the forearm. \n\nThe metacarpal bones are analogous to the metatarsal
    bones in the foot.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\n\nThe metacarpals form a transverse
    arch to which the rigid row of distal carpal bones are fixed. \n\nThe peripheral
    metacarpals (those of the thumb and little finger) form the sides of the cup
    of the palmar gutter and as they are brought together they deepen this concavity.
    \n\nThe index metacarpal is the most firmly fixed, while the thumb metacarpal
    articulates with the trapezium and acts independently from the others. \n\nThe
    middle metacarpals are tightly united to the carpus by intrinsic interlocking
    bone elements at their bases. \n\nThe ring metacarpal is somewhat more mobile
    while the fifth metacarpal is semi-independent.Each metacarpal bone consists
    of a body or shaft, and two extremities: the head at the distal or digital end
    (near the fingers), and the base at the proximal or carpal end (close to the
    wrist).\n\n\n=== Body ===\n\nThe body (shaft) is prismoid in form, and curved,
    so as to be convex in the longitudinal direction behind, concave in front. \n\nIt
    presents three surfaces: medial, lateral, and dorsal.\n\nThe medial and lateral
    surfaces are concave, for the attachment of the interosseus muscles, and separated
    from one another by a prominent anterior ridge.\n\nThe dorsal surface presents
    in its distal two-thirds a smooth, triangular, flattened area which is covered
    in by the tendons of the extensor muscles. \n\nThis surface is bounded by two
    lines, which commence in small tubercles situated on either side of the digital
    extremity, and, passing upward, converge and meet some distance above the center
    of the bone and form a ridge which runs along the rest of the dorsal surface
    to the carpal extremity. \n\nThis ridge separates two sloping surfaces for the
    attachment of the interossei dorsales.\n\nTo the tubercles on the digital extremities
    are attached the collateral ligaments of the metacarpophalangeal joints.\n\n\n===
    Base ===\n\nThe base (basis) or carpal extremity is of a cuboidal form, and broader
    behind than in front: it articulates with the carpal bones and with the adjoining
    metacarpal bones; its dorsal and volar surfaces are rough, for the attachment
    of ligaments.\n\n\n=== Head ===\n\nThe head (caput) or digital extremity presents
    an oblong surface markedly convex from before backward, less so transversely,
    and flattened from side to side; it articulates with the proximal phalanx. \n\nIt
    is broader, and extends farther upward, on the volar than on the dorsal aspect,
    and is longer in the antero-posterior than in the transverse diameter. \n\nOn
    either side of the head is a tubercle for the attachment of the collateral ligament
    of the metacarpophalangeal joint.\n\nThe dorsal surface, broad and flat, supports
    the tendons of the extensor muscles.\n\nThe volar surface is grooved in the middle
    line for the passage of the flexor tendons, and marked on either side by an articular
    eminence continuous with the terminal articular surface.\n\n\n=== Neck ===\n\nThe
    neck, or subcapital segment, is the transition zone between the body and the
    head.\n\n\n=== Articulations ===\n\nBesides the metacarpophalangeal joints, the
    metacarpal bones articulate by carpometacarpal joints as follows:\n\n-the first
    with the trapezium;\n-the second with the trapezium, trapezoid, capitate and
    third metacarpal;\n-the third with the capitate and second and fourth metacarpals;\n-the
    fourth with the capitate, hamate, and third and fifth metacarpals;\n-and the
    fifth with the hamate and fourth metacarpal;\n        \n\n\n=== Insertions ===\n\n-Extensor
    Carpi Radialis Longus/Brevis: Both insert on the base of metacarpal II; Assist
    with wrist extension and radial flexion of the wrist\n-Extensor Carpi Ulnaris:
    Inserts on the base of metacarpal V; Extends and fixes wrist when digits are
    being flexed; assists with ulnar flexion of wrist\n-Abductor Pollicis Longus:
    Inserts on the trapezium and base of metacarpal I; Abducts thumb in frontal plane;
    extends thumb at carpometacarpal joint\n-Opponens Pollicis: Inserts on metacarpal
    I; flexes metacarpal I to oppose the thumb to the fingertips\n-Opponens digiti
    minimi: Inserts on the medial surface of metacarpal V; Flexes metacarpal V at
    carpometacarpal joint when little finger is moved into opposition with tip of
    thumb; deepens palm of hand.\n\n        \n\n\n== Clinical significance ==\n\n===
    Congenital disorders ===\n\nThe fourth and fifth metacarpal bones are commonly
    \"blunted\" or shortened, in pseudohypoparathyroidism and pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism.\n\nA
    blunted fourth metacarpal, with normal fifth metacarpal, can signify Turner syndrome.\n\nBlunted
    metacarpals (particularly the fourth metacarpal) are a symptom of Nevoid basal
    cell carcinoma syndrome.\n\n\n=== Fracture ===\n\nThe neck of a metacarpal is
    a common location for a boxer's fracture. \n\nHowever, all parts of the metacarpal
    bone (including head, body and base) are susceptible to fracture. \n\nFor these
    fractures several types of treatment exist ranging from non-operative techniques
    with or without immobilization to operative techniques using closed or open reduction
    and internal fixation (ORIF). \n\nGenerally speaking most fractures showing little
    or no displacement can be treated successfully without surgery. \n\nIntraarticular
    fracture-dislocations of the metacarpal head or base may require surgical fixation,
    as fragment displacement affecting the joint surface is rarely tolerated well.\n\n\n==
    Other animals ==\n\nIn four-legged animals, the metacarpals form part of the
    forefeet, and are frequently reduced in number, appropriate to the number of
    toes. \n\nIn digitigrade and unguligrade animals, the metacarpals are greatly
    extended and strengthened, forming an additional segment to the limb, a feature
    that typically enhances the animal's speed. \n\nIn both birds and bats, the metacarpals
    form part of the wing.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Etymology ===\n\nThe Greek physician
    Galen used to refer to the metacarpus as \u03BC\u03B5\u03C4\u03B1\u03BA\u03AC\u03C1\u03C0\u03B9\u03BF\u03BD.
    \n\nThe Latin form metacarpium more truly resembles its Ancient Greek predecessor
    \u03BC\u03B5\u03C4\u03B1\u03BA\u03AC\u03C1\u03C0\u03B9\u03BF\u03BD than metacarpus.
    \n\nMeta\u2013 is Greek for beyond and carpal from Ancient Greek \u03BA\u03B1\u03C1\u03C0\u03CC\u03C2
    (karp\xF3s, \u201Cwrist\u201D).\n\nIn anatomic Latin, adjectives like metacarpius,
    metacarpicus, metacarpiaeus, metacarpeus, metacarpianus and metacarpalis can
    be found. \n\nThe form metacarpius is more true to the later Greek form \u03BC\u03B5\u03C4\u03B1\u03BA\u03AC\u03C1\u03C0\u03B9\u03BF\u03C2.
    \n\nMetacarpalis, as in ossa metacarpalia in the current official Latin nomenclature,
    Terminologia Anatomica is a compound consisting of Latin and Greek parts. \n\nThe
    usage of such hybrids in anatomic Latin is disapproved by some.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacarpal_bones"

  descriptionText: "\n\nPHALANX\n\n\nThe phalanx (Ancient Greek: \u03C6\u03AC\u03BB\u03B1\u03B3\u03BE;
    plural phalanxes or phalanges, \u03C6\u03AC\u03BB\u03B1\u03B3\u03B3\u03B5\u03C2,
    phalanges) was a rectangular mass military formation, usually composed entirely
    of heavy infantry armed with spears, pikes, sarissas, or similar pole weapons.
    \n\nThe term is particularly used to describe the use of this formation in Ancient
    Greek warfare, although the ancient Greek writers used it to also describe any
    massed infantry formation, regardless of its equipment. \n\nArrian uses the term
    in his Array against the Alans when he refers to his legions. \n\nIn Greek texts,
    the phalanx may be deployed for battle, on the march, or even camped, thus describing
    the mass of infantry or cavalry that would deploy in line during battle. \n\nThey
    marched forward as one entity. \nThe term itself, as used today, does not refer
    to a distinctive military unit or division (e.g., the Roman legion or the contemporary
    Western-type battalion), but to the type of formation of an army's troops. \n\nTherefore,
    this term does not indicate a standard combat strength or composition but includes
    the total number of infantry, which is deployed in a single formation known as
    a \"phalanx\".\nMany spear-armed troops historically fought in what might be
    termed phalanx-like formations. \n\nThis article focuses on the use of the military
    phalanx formation in Ancient Greece, the Hellenistic world, and other ancient
    states heavily influenced by Greek civilization.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe earliest
    known depiction of a phalanx-like formation occurs in a Sumerian stele from the
    25th century BC. \n\nHere the troops seem to have been equipped with spears,
    helmets, and large shields covering the whole body. \n\nAncient Egyptian infantry
    were known to have employed similar formations. \n\nThe first usage of the term
    phalanx comes from Homer's \"\u03C6\u03B1\u03BB\u03B1\u03B3\u03BE\", used to
    describe hoplites fighting in an organized battle line. \n\nHomer used the term
    to differentiate the formation-based combat from the individual duels so often
    found in his poems.Historians have not arrived at a consensus about the relationship
    between the Greek formation and these predecessors of the hoplites. \n\nThe principles
    of shield wall and spear hedge were almost universally known among the armies
    of major civilizations throughout history, and so the similarities may be related
    to convergent evolution instead of diffusion.\nTraditionally, historians date
    the origin of the hoplite phalanx of ancient Greece to the 8th century BC in
    Sparta, but this is under revision. \n\nIt is perhaps more likely that the formation
    was devised in the 7th century BC after the introduction of the aspis by the
    city of Argos, which would have made the formation possible. \n\nThis is further
    evidenced by the Chigi vase, dated to 650 BC, identifying hoplites armed with
    aspis, spear and panoply.Another possible theory as to the birth of Greek phalanx
    warfare stems from the idea that some of the basic aspects of the phalanx were
    present in earlier times yet were not fully developed due to the lack of appropriate
    technology. \n\nTwo of the basic tactics seen in earlier warfare include the
    principle of cohesion and the use of large groups of soldiers. \n\nThis would
    suggest that the Greek phalanx was rather the culmination and perfection of a
    slowly developed idea that originated many years earlier. \n\nAs weaponry and
    armour advanced through the years in different city-states, the phalanx became
    complex and effective.\n\n\n== Overview ==\n\nThe hoplite phalanx of the Archaic
    and Classical periods in Greece (c. 800\u2013350 BC) was the formation in which
    the hoplites would line up in ranks in close order. \n\nThe hoplites would lock
    their shields together, and the first few ranks of soldiers would project their
    spears out over the first rank of shields. \n\nThe phalanx therefore presented
    a shield wall and a mass of spear points to the enemy, making frontal assaults
    against it very difficult. \n\nIt also allowed a higher proportion of the soldiers
    to be actively engaged in combat at a given time (rather than just those in the
    front rank).\nBattles between two phalanxes usually took place in open, flat
    plains where it was easier to advance and stay in formation. \n\nRough terrain
    or hilly regions would have made it difficult to maintain a steady line and would
    have defeated the purpose of a phalanx. \n\nAs a result, battles between Greek
    city-states would not take place in just any location, nor would they be limited
    to sometimes obvious strategic points. \n\nRather, many times, the two opposing
    sides would find the most suitable piece of land where the conflict could be
    settled. \n\nTypically, the battle ended with one of the two fighting forces
    fleeing to safety.The phalanx usually advanced at a walking pace, although it
    is possible that they picked up speed during the last several yards. \n\nOne
    of the main reasons for this slow approach was to maintain formation. \n\nThe
    formation would be rendered useless if the phalanx was lost as the unit approached
    the enemy and could even become detrimental to the advancing unit, resulting
    in a weaker formation that was easier for an enemy force to break through. \n\nIf
    the hoplites of the phalanx were to pick up speed toward the latter part of the
    advance, it would have been for the purpose of gaining momentum against the enemy
    in the initial collision. \n\nHerodotus states of the Greeks at the Battle of
    Marathon, that \"They were the first Greeks we know of to charge their enemy
    at a run\". \n\nMany historians believe that this innovation was precipitated
    by their desire to minimize their losses from Persian archery. \n\nThe opposing
    sides would collide, possibly severing many of the spears of the row in front
    and killing the front part of the enemy army due to the bone-breaking collision.\nThe
    spears of a phalanx had spiked butts. \n\nIn battle, the back ranks used the
    spikes to finish fallen enemy soldiers.\n\n\n=== Pushing ===\n\nThe \"physical
    pushing match\" theory is one where the battle would rely on the valour of the
    men in the front line, whilst those in the rear maintained forward pressure on
    the front ranks with their shields, and the whole formation would consistently
    press forward trying to break the enemy formation. \n\nThis is the most widely
    accepted interpretation of the ancient sources thus when two phalanx formations
    engaged, the struggle essentially became a pushing match. \n\nHistorians such
    as Victor Davis Hanson point out that it is difficult to account for exceptionally
    deep phalanx formations unless they were necessary to facilitate the physical
    pushing depicted by this theory, as those behind the first two ranks could not
    take part in the actual spear thrusting.No Greek art ever depicts anything like
    a phalanx pushing match, so this hypothesis is a product of educated speculation
    rather than explicit testimony from contemporary sources and is far from being
    academically resolved. \n\nThe Greek term for \"push\" was used in the same metaphorical
    manner as the English word is (for example it was also used to describe the process
    of rhetorical arguments) and so does not necessarily describe a literal physical
    push, although it is possible that it did.\nFor instance, if Othismos were to
    accurately describe a physical pushing match, it would be logical to state that
    the deeper phalanx would always win an engagement since the physical strength
    of individuals would not compensate for even one additional rank on the enemy
    side. \n\nHowever, there are numerous examples of shallow phalanxes holding off
    an opponent. \n\nFor instance, at Delium in 424 BC, the Athenian left flank,
    a formation eight men deep, held off a formation of Thebans 25 deep without immediate
    collapse. \n\nIt is difficult with the physical pushing model to imagine eight
    men withstanding the pushing force of 25 opponents for a matter of seconds, let
    alone half the battle.\nSuch arguments have led to a wave of counter-criticism
    to physical shoving theorists. \n\nAdrian Goldsworthy, in his article \"The Othismos,
    Myths and Heresies: The nature of Hoplite Battle\", argues that the physical
    pushing match model does not fit with the average casualty figures of hoplite
    warfare nor the practical realities of moving large formations of men in battle.
    \n\nThis debate has yet to be resolved amongst scholars.\nPractical difficulties
    with this theory also include the fact that, in a shoving match, an eight-foot
    spear is too long to fight effectively or even parry attacks. \n\nSpears enable
    a formation of men to keep their enemies at a distance, parry attacks aimed at
    them and their comrades, and give the necessary reach to strike multiple men
    in the opposite formation. \n\nA pushing match would put enemies so close together
    that a quick stabbing with a knife would kill the front row almost instantly.
    \n\nThe crush of men would also prevent the formation from withdrawing or retreating,
    which would result in much higher casualties than is recorded. \n\nThe speed
    at which this would occur would also end the battle very quickly, instead of
    prolonging it for hours.\n\n\n=== Shields ===\n\nEach individual hoplite carried
    his shield on his left arm, protecting not only himself but also the soldier
    to the left. \n\nThis meant that the men at the extreme right of the phalanx
    were only half-protected. \n\nIn battle, opposing phalanxes would try to exploit
    this weakness by attempting to overlap the enemy's right flank. \n\nIt also meant
    that, in battle, a phalanx would tend to drift to the right (as hoplites sought
    to remain behind the shield of their neighbor). \n\nSome groups, such as the
    Spartans at Nemea, tried to use this phenomenon to their advantage. \n\nIn this
    case, the phalanx would sacrifice its left side, which typically consisted of
    allied troops, in an effort to overtake the enemy from the flank. \n\nIt is unlikely
    that this strategy worked very often, as it is not mentioned frequently in ancient
    Greek literature.There was a leader in each row of a phalanx, and a rear rank
    officer, the ouragos (meaning tail-leader), who kept order in the rear. \n\nThe
    hoplites had to trust their neighbors to protect them and in turn be willing
    to protect their neighbors; a phalanx was thus only as strong as its weakest
    elements. \n\nThe effectiveness of the phalanx therefore depended on how well
    the hoplites could maintain this formation in combat and how well they could
    stand their ground, especially when engaged against another phalanx. \n\nFor
    this reason, the formation was deliberately organized to group friends and family
    close together, thus providing a psychological incentive to support one's fellows,
    and a disincentive, through shame, to panic or attempt to flee. \n\nThe more
    disciplined and courageous the army, the more likely it was to win \u2013 often
    engagements between the various city-states of Greece would be resolved by one
    side fleeing before the battle. \n\nThe Greek word dynamis, the 'will to fight',
    expresses the drive that kept hoplites in formation.\n\nNow of those, who dare,
    abiding one beside another, to advance to the close fray, and the foremost champions,
    fewer die, and they save the people in the rear; but in men that fear, all excellence
    is lost. \n\nNo one could ever in words go through those several ills, which
    befall a man, if he has been actuated by cowardice. \n\nFor 'tis grievous to
    wound in the rear the back of a flying man in hostile war. \n\nShameful too is
    a corpse lying low in the dust, wounded behind in the back by the point of a
    spear.\n\n\n=== Hoplite armament ===\n\nEach hoplite provided his own equipment.
    \n\nThe primary hoplite weapon was a spear around 2.4 metres (7.9 ft) in length
    called a dory. \n\nAlthough accounts of its length vary, it is usually now believed
    to have been seven to nine feet long (~2.1\u20132.7 m). \n\nIt was held one-handed,
    with the other hand holding the hoplite's shield (aspis). \n\nThe spearhead was
    usually a curved leaf shape, while the rear of the spear had a spike called a
    sauroter ('lizard-killer') which was used to stand the spear in the ground (hence
    the name). \n\nIt was also used as a secondary weapon if the main shaft snapped
    or to kill enemies lying on the ground. \n\nThis was a common problem, especially
    for soldiers who were involved in the initial clash with the enemy. \n\nDespite
    the snapping of the spear, hoplites could easily switch to the sauroter without
    great consequence. \n\nThe rear ranks used the secondary end to finish off fallen
    opponents as the phalanx advanced over them.\nThroughout the hoplite era, the
    standard hoplite armour went through many cyclical changes. \n\nAn Archaic hoplite
    typically wore a bronze breastplate, a bronze helmet with cheekplates, as well
    as greaves and other armour. \n\nLater, in the classical period, the breastplate
    became less common, replaced instead with a corselet that some claim was made
    of linothorax (layers of linen glued together), or perhaps of leather, sometimes
    covered in whole or in part with overlapping metal scales. \n\nEventually, even
    greaves became less commonly used, although degrees of heavier armour remained,
    as attested by Xenophon as late as 401 BC.These changes reflected the balancing
    of mobility with protection, especially as cavalry became more prominent in the
    Peloponnesian War and the need to combat light troops, which were increasingly
    used to negate the hoplite's role as the primary force in battle. \n\nYet bronze
    armour remained in some form until the end of the hoplite era. \n\nSome archaeologists
    have pointed out that bronze armour does not actually provide as much protection
    from direct blows as more extensive corselet padding, and have suggested its
    continued use was a matter of status for those who could afford it. \n\nIn the
    classical Greek dialect, there is no word for swordsmen; yet hoplites also carried
    a short sword called the xiphos, used as a secondary weapon if the dory was broken
    or lost. \n\nSamples of the xiphos recovered at excavation sites were typically
    around 60 cm (24 in) in length. \n\nThese swords were double-edged and could
    therefore be used as a cutting and thrusting weapon. \n\nThese short swords were
    often used to stab or cut at the enemy's neck during close combat.Hoplites carried
    a circular shield called a hoplon (often referred to as an aspis) made from wood
    and covered in bronze, measuring roughly 1 metre (3.3 ft) in diameter. \n\nIt
    spanned from chin to knee and was very heavy (8\u201315 kg (18\u201333 lb)).
    \n\nThis medium-sized shield (fairly large for the period considering the average
    male height) was made possible partly by its dish-like shape, which allowed it
    to be supported with the rim on the shoulder. \n\nThis was quite an important
    feature of the shield, especially for the hoplites that remained in the latter
    ranks. \n\nWhile these soldiers continued to help press forward, they did not
    have the added burden of holding up their shield. \n\nBut the circular shield
    was not without its disadvantages. \n\nDespite its mobility, protective curve,
    and double straps the circular shape created gaps in the shield wall at both
    its top and bottom. (Top gaps were somewhat reduced by the one or two spears
    jutting out of the gap. \n\nIn order to minimize the bottom gaps, thick leather
    'curtains' were used but only by an [unknown] percentage of the hoplites, possibly
    mostly in the first row only since there were disadvantages as well: considerable
    added weight on an already heavy shield and a certain additional cost.) These
    gaps left parts of the hoplite exposed to potentially lethal spear thrusts and
    were a persistent vulnerability for hoplites controlling the front lines.\n\n\n===
    Phalangite armament ===\n\nThe phalanx of the Ancient Macedonian kingdom and
    the later Hellenistic successor states was a development of the hoplite phalanx.
    \n\nThe 'phalangites' were armed with a much longer spear, the sarissa, and less
    heavily armoured. \n\nThe sarissa was the pike used by the ancient Macedonian
    army. \n\nIts actual length is unknown, but apparently it was twice as long as
    the dory. \n\nThis makes it at least 14 feet (4.3 m), but 18 feet (5.5 m) appears
    more likely. (The cavalry xyston was 12.5 feet (3.8 m) by comparison.) The great
    length of the pike was balanced by a counterweight at the rear end, which also
    functioned as a butt-spike, allowing the sarissa to be planted into the ground.
    \n\nBecause of its great length, weight and different balance, a sarissa was
    wielded two-handed. \n\nThis meant that the aspis was no longer a practical defence.
    \n\nInstead, the phalangites strapped a smaller pelte shield (usually reserved
    for peltasts, light skirmishers) to their left forearm. \n\nRecent theories,
    including examination of ancient frescoes depicting full sets of weapons and
    armor, claim that the shields used were actually larger than the pelte but smaller
    than the aspis, hanging by leather strap(s) from the left shoulder or from both
    shoulders. \n\nThe shield would retain handling straps in the inner curve, to
    be handled like a (smaller) aspis if the fight progressed to sword-wielding.
    \n\nAlthough in both shield size assumptions this reduced the shield wall, the
    extreme length of the spear kept the enemy at a greater distance, as the pikes
    of the first three to five ranks could all be brought to bear in front of the
    front row. \n\nThis pike had to be held underhand, as the shield would have obscured
    the soldier's vision had it been held overhead. \n\nIt would also be very hard
    to remove a sarissa from anything it stuck in (the earth, shields, and soldiers
    of the opposition) if it were thrust downwards, due to its length. \n\nThe Macedonian
    phalanx was much less able to form a shield wall, but the lengthened spears would
    have compensated for this. \n\nSuch a phalanx formation also reduced the likelihood
    that battles would degenerate into a pushing match.\n\n\n== Deployment and combat
    ==\n\n=== Phalanx composition and strength ===\n\nThe basic combat element of
    the Greek armies was either the stichos (meaning 'file'; usually 8\u201316 men
    strong) or the enomotia (meaning 'sworn' and made up by 2\u20134 stich\u0153,
    totaling up to 32 men), both led by a dim\u0153rites who was assisted by a decadarchos
    and two decaster\u0153 (sing. decasteros). \n\nFour to a maximum of 32 enomoti\xE6
    (depending on the era in question or the city) were forming a lochos led by a
    lochagos, who in this way was in command of initially 100 hoplites to a maximum
    of c. 500 in the late Hellenistic armies. \n\nHere, it has to be noted that the
    military manuals of Asclepiodotus and Aelian use the term lochos to denote a
    file in the phalanx. \n\nA taxis (mora for the Spartans) was the greatest standard
    hoplitic formation of 500 to 1500 men, led by a strategos (general). \n\nThe
    entire army, a total of several taxeis or mor\xE6 was led by a generals' council.
    \n\nThe commander-in-chief was usually called a polemarchos or a strategos autocrator.\n\n\n===
    Phalanx front and depth ===\n\nHoplite phalanxes usually deployed in ranks of
    eight men or more deep; the Macedonian phalanxes were usually 16 men deep, sometimes
    reported to have been arrayed 32 men deep. \n\nThere are some notable extremes;
    at the battles of Leuctra and Mantinea, the Theban general Epaminondas arranged
    the left wing of the phalanx into a \"hammerhead\" of 50 ranks of elite hoplites
    deep (see below) and when depth was less important, phalanxes just four deep
    are recorded, as at the battle of Marathon.The phalanx depth could vary depending
    on the needs of the moment and plans of the general. \n\nWhile the phalanx was
    in march, an eis bathos formation (loose, meaning literally 'in depth') was adopted
    in order to move more freely and maintain order. \n\nThis was also the initial
    battle formation as, in addition, it permitted friendly units to pass through
    whether assaulting or retreating. \n\nIn this status, the phalanx had twice the
    normal depth and each hoplite had to occupy about 1.8\u20132 metres (5 ft 11
    in\u20136 ft 7 in) in width. \n\nWhen enemy infantry was approaching, a rapid
    switch to the pycne (spelled also pucne) formation (dense or tight formation)
    was necessary. \n\nIn that case, each man's space was halved (0.9\u20131 metre
    or 2 feet 11 inches\u20133 feet 3 inches in width) and the formation depth returned
    to normal. \n\nAn even denser formation, the synaspismos or sunaspismos (ultra-tight
    or locked shields formation), was used when the phalanx was expected to experience
    extra pressure, intense missile volleys or frontal cavalry charges. \n\nIn synaspismos,
    the rank depth was half that of a normal phalanx and the width each man occupied
    was as small as 0.45 metres (1.5 ft).\n\n\n=== Stages of combat ===\n\nSeveral
    stages in hoplite combat can be defined:\nEphodos: The hoplites stop singing
    their p\xE6anes (battle hymns) and move towards the enemy, gradually picking
    up pace and momentum. \n\nIn the instants before impact, war cries (alalagm\u0153,
    sing. alalagmos) would be made. \n\nNotable war cries were the Athenian (eleleleleu!
    eleleleleu!) and the Macedonian (alalalalai! alalalalai!) alalagm\u0153.\nKrousis:
    The opposing phalanxes meet each other almost simultaneously along their front.
    \nDoratismos: Repeated, rapid spear thrusts in order to disrupt the enemy formation.
    \n\nThe use of long spears would keep enemies apart as well as allow men in a
    row to assist their comrades next to them. \n\nThe prodding could also open up
    a man to allow a comrade to spear him. \n\nToo hard prodding could get a spear
    stuck in a shield, which would necessitate someone in the back to lend his to
    the now-disarmed man.\nOthismos: Literally 'pushing' after most spears have been
    broken, the hoplites begin to push with their spears and spear shafts against
    their opponents' shields. \n\nThis could be the longest phase.Pararrhexis: 'Breaching'
    the opposing phalanx, the enemy formation shatters and the battle ends. \n\nCavalry
    would be used at this point to mop up the scattered enemy.\n\n\n== Tactics ==\n\nThe
    early history of the phalanx is largely one of combat between hoplite armies
    from competing Greek city-states. \n\nThe usual result was rather identical,
    inflexible formations pushing against each other until one broke. \n\nThe potential
    of the phalanx to achieve something more was demonstrated at Battle of Marathon
    (490 BC). \n\nFacing the much larger army of Darius I, the Athenians thinned
    out their phalanx and consequently lengthened their front, to avoid being outflanked.
    \n\nHowever, even a reduced-depth phalanx proved unstoppable to the lightly armed
    Persian infantry. \n\nAfter routing the Persian wings, the hoplites on the Athenian
    wings wheeled inwards, destroying the elite troop at the Persian centre, resulting
    in a crushing victory for Athens. \n\nThroughout the Greco-Persian Wars the hoplite
    phalanx was to prove superior to the Persian infantry (e.g. the battles of Thermopylae
    and Plataea).\nPerhaps the most prominent example of the phalanx's evolution
    was the oblique order, made famous in the Battle of Leuctra. \n\nThere, the Theban
    general Epaminondas thinned out the right flank and centre of his phalanx, and
    deepened his left flank to an unheard-of 50 men deep. \n\nIn doing so, Epaminondas
    reversed the convention by which the right flank of the phalanx was strongest.
    \n\nThis allowed the Thebans to assault in strength the elite Spartan troops
    on the right flank of the opposing phalanx. \n\nMeanwhile, the centre and right
    flank of the Theban line were echeloned back, from the opposing phalanx, keeping
    the weakened parts of the formation from being engaged. \n\nOnce the Spartan
    right had been routed by the Theban left, the remainder of the Spartan line also
    broke. \n\nThus, by localising the attacking power of the hoplites, Epaminondas
    was able to defeat an enemy previously thought invincible.\nPhilip II of Macedon
    spent several years in Thebes as a hostage, and paid attention to Epaminondas'
    innovations. \n\nOn return to his homeland, he raised a revolutionary new infantry
    force, which was to change the face of the Greek world. \n\nPhilip's phalangites
    were the first force of professional soldiers seen in Ancient Greece apart from
    Sparta. \n\nThey were armed with longer spears (the sarissa) and were drilled
    more thoroughly in more evolved, complicated tactics and manoeuvres. \n\nMore
    importantly, though, Philip's phalanx was part of a multi-faceted, combined force
    that included a variety of skirmishers and cavalry, most notably the famous Companion
    cavalry. \n\nThe Macedonian phalanx now was used to pin the centre of the enemy
    line, while cavalry and more mobile infantry struck at the foe's flanks. \n\nIts
    supremacy over the more static armies fielded by the Greek city-states was shown
    at the Battle of Chaeronea, where Philip II's army crushed the allied Theban
    and Athenian phalanxes.\n\n\n== Weaknesses ==\n\nThe hoplite phalanx was weakest
    when facing an enemy fielding lighter and more flexible troops without its own
    such supporting troops. \n\nAn example of this would be the Battle of Lechaeum,
    where an Athenian contingent led by Iphicrates routed an entire Spartan mora
    (a unit of anywhere from 500 to 900 hoplites). \n\nThe Athenian force had a considerable
    proportion of light missile troops armed with javelins and bows that wore down
    the Spartans with repeated attacks, causing disarray in the Spartan ranks and
    an eventual rout when they spotted Athenian heavy infantry reinforcements trying
    to flank them by boat.\nThe Macedonian phalanx had weaknesses similar to its
    hoplitic predecessor. \n\nTheoretically indestructible from the front, its flanks
    and rear were very vulnerable, and once engaged it may not easily disengage or
    redeploy to face a threat from those directions. \n\nThus, a phalanx facing non-phalangite
    formations required some sort of protection on its flanks\u2014lighter or at
    least more mobile infantry, cavalry, etc. \n\nThis was shown at the Battle of
    Magnesia, where, once the Seleucid supporting cavalry elements were driven off,
    the phalanx was static and unable to go on the offensive against its Roman opponents
    (although they continued to resist stoutly and attempted a fighting withdrawal
    under a hail of Roman missiles, until the elephants posted on their flanks panicked
    and disrupted their formation).\nThe Macedonian phalanx could also lose its cohesion
    without proper coordination or while moving through broken terrain; doing so
    could create gaps between individual blocks/syntagmata, or could prevent a solid
    front within those sub-units as well, causing other sections of the line to bunch
    up. \n\nIn this event, as in the battles of Cynoscephalae and Pydna, the phalanx
    became vulnerable to attacks by more flexible units\u2014such as Roman legionary
    centuries, which were able to avoid the sarissae and engage in hand-to-hand combat
    with the phalangites.\nAnother important area that must be considered concerns
    the psychological tendencies of the hoplites. \n\nBecause the strength of a phalanx
    depended on the ability of the hoplites to maintain their frontline, it was crucial
    that a phalanx be able to quickly and efficiently replace fallen soldiers in
    the front ranks. \n\nIf a phalanx failed to do this in a structured manner, the
    opposing phalanx would have an opportunity to breach the line which, many times,
    would lead to a quick defeat. \n\nThis then implies that the hoplites ranks closer
    to the front must be mentally prepared to replace their fallen comrade and adapt
    to his new position without disrupting the structure of the frontline.Finally,
    most of the phalanx-centric armies tended to lack supporting echelons behind
    the main line of battle. \n\nThis meant that breaking through the line of battle
    or compromising one of its flanks often ensured victory.\n\n\n== Classical decline
    and post-classical use ==\n\nAfter reaching its zenith in the conquests of Alexander
    the Great, the phalanx began a slow decline, as Macedonian successor states declined.
    \n\nThe combined arms tactics used by Alexander and his father were gradually
    replaced by a return to the simpler frontal charge tactics of the hoplite phalanx.
    \n\nThe expense of the supporting arms and cavalry, and the widespread use of
    mercenaries, caused the Diadochi to rely on phalanx vs. phalanx tactics during
    the Wars of the Diadochi.\nThe decline of the Diadochi and the phalanx was linked
    with the rise of Rome and the Roman legions from the 3rd century BC. \n\nThe
    Battle of the Caudine Forks showed the clumsiness of the Roman phalanx against
    the Samnites. \n\nThe Romans had originally employed the phalanx themselves but
    gradually evolved more flexible tactics. \n\nThe result was the three-line Roman
    legion of the middle period of the Roman Republic, the Manipular System. \n\nRomans
    used a phalanx for their third military line, the triarii. \n\nThese were veteran
    reserve troops armed with the hastae or spear. \n\nRome conquered most of the
    Macedonian successor states. \n\nAlso the various Greek city-states and leagues.
    \n\nAs these states ceased to exist, so did the armies which used the traditional
    phalanx. \n\nSubsequently, troops from these regions were equipped, trained and
    fought using the Roman model.\nA phalanx formation called the phoulkon appeared
    in the late Roman army and Byzantine army. \n\nIt had characteristics of the
    classical Greek and Hellenistic phalanxes, but was more flexible. \n\nIt was
    used against cavalry more than infantry.\nHowever, the phalanx did not totally
    disappear. \n\nIn some battles between the Roman army and Hellenistic phalanxes,
    such as Pydna (168 BC), Cynoscephalae (197 BC) and Magnesia (190 BC), the phalanx
    performed well. \n\nIt even drove back the Roman infantry. \n\nHowever, at Cynoscephalae
    and Magnesia, failure to defend the flanks of the phalanx led to defeat. \n\nAt
    Pydna, the phalanx lost cohesion when pursuing retreating Roman soldiers. \n\nThis
    allowed the Romans to penetrate the formation. \n\nThen, Roman close combat skills
    proved decisive. \n\nThe historian Polybius details the effectiveness of the
    Roman legion against the phalanx. \n\nHe deduces that the Romans refused to fight
    the phalanx where the phalanx was effective, Romans offered battle only when
    a legion could exploit the clumsiness and immobility of a phalanx.\n\nSpear-armed
    troops continued to be important elements in many armies until reliable firearms
    became available. \n\nThese did not necessarily fight as a phalanx. \n\nFor example,
    compare the classical phalanx and late medieval pike formations.Military historians
    have suggested that the Scots under William Wallace and Robert the Bruce consciously
    imitated the Hellenistic phalanx to produce the Scots 'hedgehog' or schiltron.
    \n\nHowever, long spears might have been used by Picts and others in Scotlands'
    Early Middle Ages. \n\nPrior to 1066, long spear tactics (also found in North
    Wales) might have been part of irregular warfare in Britain. \n\nThe Scots used
    imported French pikes and dynamic tactics at the Battle of Flodden. \n\nHowever,
    Flodden found the Scots pitted against effective light artillery, while advancing
    over bad ground. \n\nThe combination disorganised the Scotts phalanxes and permitted
    effective attacks by English longbowmen, and soldiers wielding shorter, handier
    polearms called bills. \n\nSome contemporary sources might say that the bills
    cut off the heads of Scots pikes.\nThe pike was briefly reconsidered as a weapon
    by European armies in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. \n\nIt could protect
    riflemen, whose slower rate of fire made them vulnerable. \n\nA collapsible pike
    was invented but never issued. \n\nThe Confederate Army considered these for
    the American Civil War. \n\nSome were even manufactured but probably were never
    issued. \n\nPikes were manufactured during World War II as \"Croft's Pikes\".\nWhile
    obsolete in military practice, the phalanx remained in use as a metaphor of warriors
    moving forward as a single united block. \n\nThis metaphor inspired several 20th-century
    political movements, notably the Spanish Falange and its ideology of Falangism.\nThe
    Byzantines continued and improved the use of the classical Greek phalanx alongside
    the Macedonian-style phalanx. \n\nThe latter was based on a model that Alexander
    himself had created and had tried to give more importance to the skirmishers
    and cavalry, yet it never saw action until the Byzantines adopted the model that
    rely in a mixture of many units sometimes. \n\nMany writers of the age describe
    the spear as being a sarissa yet it was a meter short than the original sarissa
    and had being modified by the time, yet the term for the long spear remained
    alongside with its other names.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phalanx"

  descriptionText: "\n\nPHALANX\n\n\nThe phalanx (Ancient Greek: \u03C6\u03AC\u03BB\u03B1\u03B3\u03BE;
    plural phalanxes or phalanges, \u03C6\u03AC\u03BB\u03B1\u03B3\u03B3\u03B5\u03C2,
    phalanges) was a rectangular mass military formation, usually composed entirely
    of heavy infantry armed with spears, pikes, sarissas, or similar pole weapons.
    \n\nThe term is particularly used to describe the use of this formation in Ancient
    Greek warfare, although the ancient Greek writers used it to also describe any
    massed infantry formation, regardless of its equipment. \n\nArrian uses the term
    in his Array against the Alans when he refers to his legions. \n\nIn Greek texts,
    the phalanx may be deployed for battle, on the march, or even camped, thus describing
    the mass of infantry or cavalry that would deploy in line during battle. \n\nThey
    marched forward as one entity. \nThe term itself, as used today, does not refer
    to a distinctive military unit or division (e.g., the Roman legion or the contemporary
    Western-type battalion), but to the type of formation of an army's troops. \n\nTherefore,
    this term does not indicate a standard combat strength or composition but includes
    the total number of infantry, which is deployed in a single formation known as
    a \"phalanx\".\nMany spear-armed troops historically fought in what might be
    termed phalanx-like formations. \n\nThis article focuses on the use of the military
    phalanx formation in Ancient Greece, the Hellenistic world, and other ancient
    states heavily influenced by Greek civilization.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe earliest
    known depiction of a phalanx-like formation occurs in a Sumerian stele from the
    25th century BC. \n\nHere the troops seem to have been equipped with spears,
    helmets, and large shields covering the whole body. \n\nAncient Egyptian infantry
    were known to have employed similar formations. \n\nThe first usage of the term
    phalanx comes from Homer's \"\u03C6\u03B1\u03BB\u03B1\u03B3\u03BE\", used to
    describe hoplites fighting in an organized battle line. \n\nHomer used the term
    to differentiate the formation-based combat from the individual duels so often
    found in his poems.Historians have not arrived at a consensus about the relationship
    between the Greek formation and these predecessors of the hoplites. \n\nThe principles
    of shield wall and spear hedge were almost universally known among the armies
    of major civilizations throughout history, and so the similarities may be related
    to convergent evolution instead of diffusion.\nTraditionally, historians date
    the origin of the hoplite phalanx of ancient Greece to the 8th century BC in
    Sparta, but this is under revision. \n\nIt is perhaps more likely that the formation
    was devised in the 7th century BC after the introduction of the aspis by the
    city of Argos, which would have made the formation possible. \n\nThis is further
    evidenced by the Chigi vase, dated to 650 BC, identifying hoplites armed with
    aspis, spear and panoply.Another possible theory as to the birth of Greek phalanx
    warfare stems from the idea that some of the basic aspects of the phalanx were
    present in earlier times yet were not fully developed due to the lack of appropriate
    technology. \n\nTwo of the basic tactics seen in earlier warfare include the
    principle of cohesion and the use of large groups of soldiers. \n\nThis would
    suggest that the Greek phalanx was rather the culmination and perfection of a
    slowly developed idea that originated many years earlier. \n\nAs weaponry and
    armour advanced through the years in different city-states, the phalanx became
    complex and effective.\n\n\n== Overview ==\n\nThe hoplite phalanx of the Archaic
    and Classical periods in Greece (c. 800\u2013350 BC) was the formation in which
    the hoplites would line up in ranks in close order. \n\nThe hoplites would lock
    their shields together, and the first few ranks of soldiers would project their
    spears out over the first rank of shields. \n\nThe phalanx therefore presented
    a shield wall and a mass of spear points to the enemy, making frontal assaults
    against it very difficult. \n\nIt also allowed a higher proportion of the soldiers
    to be actively engaged in combat at a given time (rather than just those in the
    front rank).\nBattles between two phalanxes usually took place in open, flat
    plains where it was easier to advance and stay in formation. \n\nRough terrain
    or hilly regions would have made it difficult to maintain a steady line and would
    have defeated the purpose of a phalanx. \n\nAs a result, battles between Greek
    city-states would not take place in just any location, nor would they be limited
    to sometimes obvious strategic points. \n\nRather, many times, the two opposing
    sides would find the most suitable piece of land where the conflict could be
    settled. \n\nTypically, the battle ended with one of the two fighting forces
    fleeing to safety.The phalanx usually advanced at a walking pace, although it
    is possible that they picked up speed during the last several yards. \n\nOne
    of the main reasons for this slow approach was to maintain formation. \n\nThe
    formation would be rendered useless if the phalanx was lost as the unit approached
    the enemy and could even become detrimental to the advancing unit, resulting
    in a weaker formation that was easier for an enemy force to break through. \n\nIf
    the hoplites of the phalanx were to pick up speed toward the latter part of the
    advance, it would have been for the purpose of gaining momentum against the enemy
    in the initial collision. \n\nHerodotus states of the Greeks at the Battle of
    Marathon, that \"They were the first Greeks we know of to charge their enemy
    at a run\". \n\nMany historians believe that this innovation was precipitated
    by their desire to minimize their losses from Persian archery. \n\nThe opposing
    sides would collide, possibly severing many of the spears of the row in front
    and killing the front part of the enemy army due to the bone-breaking collision.\nThe
    spears of a phalanx had spiked butts. \n\nIn battle, the back ranks used the
    spikes to finish fallen enemy soldiers.\n\n\n=== Pushing ===\n\nThe \"physical
    pushing match\" theory is one where the battle would rely on the valour of the
    men in the front line, whilst those in the rear maintained forward pressure on
    the front ranks with their shields, and the whole formation would consistently
    press forward trying to break the enemy formation. \n\nThis is the most widely
    accepted interpretation of the ancient sources thus when two phalanx formations
    engaged, the struggle essentially became a pushing match. \n\nHistorians such
    as Victor Davis Hanson point out that it is difficult to account for exceptionally
    deep phalanx formations unless they were necessary to facilitate the physical
    pushing depicted by this theory, as those behind the first two ranks could not
    take part in the actual spear thrusting.No Greek art ever depicts anything like
    a phalanx pushing match, so this hypothesis is a product of educated speculation
    rather than explicit testimony from contemporary sources and is far from being
    academically resolved. \n\nThe Greek term for \"push\" was used in the same metaphorical
    manner as the English word is (for example it was also used to describe the process
    of rhetorical arguments) and so does not necessarily describe a literal physical
    push, although it is possible that it did.\nFor instance, if Othismos were to
    accurately describe a physical pushing match, it would be logical to state that
    the deeper phalanx would always win an engagement since the physical strength
    of individuals would not compensate for even one additional rank on the enemy
    side. \n\nHowever, there are numerous examples of shallow phalanxes holding off
    an opponent. \n\nFor instance, at Delium in 424 BC, the Athenian left flank,
    a formation eight men deep, held off a formation of Thebans 25 deep without immediate
    collapse. \n\nIt is difficult with the physical pushing model to imagine eight
    men withstanding the pushing force of 25 opponents for a matter of seconds, let
    alone half the battle.\nSuch arguments have led to a wave of counter-criticism
    to physical shoving theorists. \n\nAdrian Goldsworthy, in his article \"The Othismos,
    Myths and Heresies: The nature of Hoplite Battle\", argues that the physical
    pushing match model does not fit with the average casualty figures of hoplite
    warfare nor the practical realities of moving large formations of men in battle.
    \n\nThis debate has yet to be resolved amongst scholars.\nPractical difficulties
    with this theory also include the fact that, in a shoving match, an eight-foot
    spear is too long to fight effectively or even parry attacks. \n\nSpears enable
    a formation of men to keep their enemies at a distance, parry attacks aimed at
    them and their comrades, and give the necessary reach to strike multiple men
    in the opposite formation. \n\nA pushing match would put enemies so close together
    that a quick stabbing with a knife would kill the front row almost instantly.
    \n\nThe crush of men would also prevent the formation from withdrawing or retreating,
    which would result in much higher casualties than is recorded. \n\nThe speed
    at which this would occur would also end the battle very quickly, instead of
    prolonging it for hours.\n\n\n=== Shields ===\n\nEach individual hoplite carried
    his shield on his left arm, protecting not only himself but also the soldier
    to the left. \n\nThis meant that the men at the extreme right of the phalanx
    were only half-protected. \n\nIn battle, opposing phalanxes would try to exploit
    this weakness by attempting to overlap the enemy's right flank. \n\nIt also meant
    that, in battle, a phalanx would tend to drift to the right (as hoplites sought
    to remain behind the shield of their neighbor). \n\nSome groups, such as the
    Spartans at Nemea, tried to use this phenomenon to their advantage. \n\nIn this
    case, the phalanx would sacrifice its left side, which typically consisted of
    allied troops, in an effort to overtake the enemy from the flank. \n\nIt is unlikely
    that this strategy worked very often, as it is not mentioned frequently in ancient
    Greek literature.There was a leader in each row of a phalanx, and a rear rank
    officer, the ouragos (meaning tail-leader), who kept order in the rear. \n\nThe
    hoplites had to trust their neighbors to protect them and in turn be willing
    to protect their neighbors; a phalanx was thus only as strong as its weakest
    elements. \n\nThe effectiveness of the phalanx therefore depended on how well
    the hoplites could maintain this formation in combat and how well they could
    stand their ground, especially when engaged against another phalanx. \n\nFor
    this reason, the formation was deliberately organized to group friends and family
    close together, thus providing a psychological incentive to support one's fellows,
    and a disincentive, through shame, to panic or attempt to flee. \n\nThe more
    disciplined and courageous the army, the more likely it was to win \u2013 often
    engagements between the various city-states of Greece would be resolved by one
    side fleeing before the battle. \n\nThe Greek word dynamis, the 'will to fight',
    expresses the drive that kept hoplites in formation.\n\nNow of those, who dare,
    abiding one beside another, to advance to the close fray, and the foremost champions,
    fewer die, and they save the people in the rear; but in men that fear, all excellence
    is lost. \n\nNo one could ever in words go through those several ills, which
    befall a man, if he has been actuated by cowardice. \n\nFor 'tis grievous to
    wound in the rear the back of a flying man in hostile war. \n\nShameful too is
    a corpse lying low in the dust, wounded behind in the back by the point of a
    spear.\n\n\n=== Hoplite armament ===\n\nEach hoplite provided his own equipment.
    \n\nThe primary hoplite weapon was a spear around 2.4 metres (7.9 ft) in length
    called a dory. \n\nAlthough accounts of its length vary, it is usually now believed
    to have been seven to nine feet long (~2.1\u20132.7 m). \n\nIt was held one-handed,
    with the other hand holding the hoplite's shield (aspis). \n\nThe spearhead was
    usually a curved leaf shape, while the rear of the spear had a spike called a
    sauroter ('lizard-killer') which was used to stand the spear in the ground (hence
    the name). \n\nIt was also used as a secondary weapon if the main shaft snapped
    or to kill enemies lying on the ground. \n\nThis was a common problem, especially
    for soldiers who were involved in the initial clash with the enemy. \n\nDespite
    the snapping of the spear, hoplites could easily switch to the sauroter without
    great consequence. \n\nThe rear ranks used the secondary end to finish off fallen
    opponents as the phalanx advanced over them.\nThroughout the hoplite era, the
    standard hoplite armour went through many cyclical changes. \n\nAn Archaic hoplite
    typically wore a bronze breastplate, a bronze helmet with cheekplates, as well
    as greaves and other armour. \n\nLater, in the classical period, the breastplate
    became less common, replaced instead with a corselet that some claim was made
    of linothorax (layers of linen glued together), or perhaps of leather, sometimes
    covered in whole or in part with overlapping metal scales. \n\nEventually, even
    greaves became less commonly used, although degrees of heavier armour remained,
    as attested by Xenophon as late as 401 BC.These changes reflected the balancing
    of mobility with protection, especially as cavalry became more prominent in the
    Peloponnesian War and the need to combat light troops, which were increasingly
    used to negate the hoplite's role as the primary force in battle. \n\nYet bronze
    armour remained in some form until the end of the hoplite era. \n\nSome archaeologists
    have pointed out that bronze armour does not actually provide as much protection
    from direct blows as more extensive corselet padding, and have suggested its
    continued use was a matter of status for those who could afford it. \n\nIn the
    classical Greek dialect, there is no word for swordsmen; yet hoplites also carried
    a short sword called the xiphos, used as a secondary weapon if the dory was broken
    or lost. \n\nSamples of the xiphos recovered at excavation sites were typically
    around 60 cm (24 in) in length. \n\nThese swords were double-edged and could
    therefore be used as a cutting and thrusting weapon. \n\nThese short swords were
    often used to stab or cut at the enemy's neck during close combat.Hoplites carried
    a circular shield called a hoplon (often referred to as an aspis) made from wood
    and covered in bronze, measuring roughly 1 metre (3.3 ft) in diameter. \n\nIt
    spanned from chin to knee and was very heavy (8\u201315 kg (18\u201333 lb)).
    \n\nThis medium-sized shield (fairly large for the period considering the average
    male height) was made possible partly by its dish-like shape, which allowed it
    to be supported with the rim on the shoulder. \n\nThis was quite an important
    feature of the shield, especially for the hoplites that remained in the latter
    ranks. \n\nWhile these soldiers continued to help press forward, they did not
    have the added burden of holding up their shield. \n\nBut the circular shield
    was not without its disadvantages. \n\nDespite its mobility, protective curve,
    and double straps the circular shape created gaps in the shield wall at both
    its top and bottom. (Top gaps were somewhat reduced by the one or two spears
    jutting out of the gap. \n\nIn order to minimize the bottom gaps, thick leather
    'curtains' were used but only by an [unknown] percentage of the hoplites, possibly
    mostly in the first row only since there were disadvantages as well: considerable
    added weight on an already heavy shield and a certain additional cost.) These
    gaps left parts of the hoplite exposed to potentially lethal spear thrusts and
    were a persistent vulnerability for hoplites controlling the front lines.\n\n\n===
    Phalangite armament ===\n\nThe phalanx of the Ancient Macedonian kingdom and
    the later Hellenistic successor states was a development of the hoplite phalanx.
    \n\nThe 'phalangites' were armed with a much longer spear, the sarissa, and less
    heavily armoured. \n\nThe sarissa was the pike used by the ancient Macedonian
    army. \n\nIts actual length is unknown, but apparently it was twice as long as
    the dory. \n\nThis makes it at least 14 feet (4.3 m), but 18 feet (5.5 m) appears
    more likely. (The cavalry xyston was 12.5 feet (3.8 m) by comparison.) The great
    length of the pike was balanced by a counterweight at the rear end, which also
    functioned as a butt-spike, allowing the sarissa to be planted into the ground.
    \n\nBecause of its great length, weight and different balance, a sarissa was
    wielded two-handed. \n\nThis meant that the aspis was no longer a practical defence.
    \n\nInstead, the phalangites strapped a smaller pelte shield (usually reserved
    for peltasts, light skirmishers) to their left forearm. \n\nRecent theories,
    including examination of ancient frescoes depicting full sets of weapons and
    armor, claim that the shields used were actually larger than the pelte but smaller
    than the aspis, hanging by leather strap(s) from the left shoulder or from both
    shoulders. \n\nThe shield would retain handling straps in the inner curve, to
    be handled like a (smaller) aspis if the fight progressed to sword-wielding.
    \n\nAlthough in both shield size assumptions this reduced the shield wall, the
    extreme length of the spear kept the enemy at a greater distance, as the pikes
    of the first three to five ranks could all be brought to bear in front of the
    front row. \n\nThis pike had to be held underhand, as the shield would have obscured
    the soldier's vision had it been held overhead. \n\nIt would also be very hard
    to remove a sarissa from anything it stuck in (the earth, shields, and soldiers
    of the opposition) if it were thrust downwards, due to its length. \n\nThe Macedonian
    phalanx was much less able to form a shield wall, but the lengthened spears would
    have compensated for this. \n\nSuch a phalanx formation also reduced the likelihood
    that battles would degenerate into a pushing match.\n\n\n== Deployment and combat
    ==\n\n=== Phalanx composition and strength ===\n\nThe basic combat element of
    the Greek armies was either the stichos (meaning 'file'; usually 8\u201316 men
    strong) or the enomotia (meaning 'sworn' and made up by 2\u20134 stich\u0153,
    totaling up to 32 men), both led by a dim\u0153rites who was assisted by a decadarchos
    and two decaster\u0153 (sing. decasteros). \n\nFour to a maximum of 32 enomoti\xE6
    (depending on the era in question or the city) were forming a lochos led by a
    lochagos, who in this way was in command of initially 100 hoplites to a maximum
    of c. 500 in the late Hellenistic armies. \n\nHere, it has to be noted that the
    military manuals of Asclepiodotus and Aelian use the term lochos to denote a
    file in the phalanx. \n\nA taxis (mora for the Spartans) was the greatest standard
    hoplitic formation of 500 to 1500 men, led by a strategos (general). \n\nThe
    entire army, a total of several taxeis or mor\xE6 was led by a generals' council.
    \n\nThe commander-in-chief was usually called a polemarchos or a strategos autocrator.\n\n\n===
    Phalanx front and depth ===\n\nHoplite phalanxes usually deployed in ranks of
    eight men or more deep; the Macedonian phalanxes were usually 16 men deep, sometimes
    reported to have been arrayed 32 men deep. \n\nThere are some notable extremes;
    at the battles of Leuctra and Mantinea, the Theban general Epaminondas arranged
    the left wing of the phalanx into a \"hammerhead\" of 50 ranks of elite hoplites
    deep (see below) and when depth was less important, phalanxes just four deep
    are recorded, as at the battle of Marathon.The phalanx depth could vary depending
    on the needs of the moment and plans of the general. \n\nWhile the phalanx was
    in march, an eis bathos formation (loose, meaning literally 'in depth') was adopted
    in order to move more freely and maintain order. \n\nThis was also the initial
    battle formation as, in addition, it permitted friendly units to pass through
    whether assaulting or retreating. \n\nIn this status, the phalanx had twice the
    normal depth and each hoplite had to occupy about 1.8\u20132 metres (5 ft 11
    in\u20136 ft 7 in) in width. \n\nWhen enemy infantry was approaching, a rapid
    switch to the pycne (spelled also pucne) formation (dense or tight formation)
    was necessary. \n\nIn that case, each man's space was halved (0.9\u20131 metre
    or 2 feet 11 inches\u20133 feet 3 inches in width) and the formation depth returned
    to normal. \n\nAn even denser formation, the synaspismos or sunaspismos (ultra-tight
    or locked shields formation), was used when the phalanx was expected to experience
    extra pressure, intense missile volleys or frontal cavalry charges. \n\nIn synaspismos,
    the rank depth was half that of a normal phalanx and the width each man occupied
    was as small as 0.45 metres (1.5 ft).\n\n\n=== Stages of combat ===\n\nSeveral
    stages in hoplite combat can be defined:\nEphodos: The hoplites stop singing
    their p\xE6anes (battle hymns) and move towards the enemy, gradually picking
    up pace and momentum. \n\nIn the instants before impact, war cries (alalagm\u0153,
    sing. alalagmos) would be made. \n\nNotable war cries were the Athenian (eleleleleu!
    eleleleleu!) and the Macedonian (alalalalai! alalalalai!) alalagm\u0153.\nKrousis:
    The opposing phalanxes meet each other almost simultaneously along their front.
    \nDoratismos: Repeated, rapid spear thrusts in order to disrupt the enemy formation.
    \n\nThe use of long spears would keep enemies apart as well as allow men in a
    row to assist their comrades next to them. \n\nThe prodding could also open up
    a man to allow a comrade to spear him. \n\nToo hard prodding could get a spear
    stuck in a shield, which would necessitate someone in the back to lend his to
    the now-disarmed man.\nOthismos: Literally 'pushing' after most spears have been
    broken, the hoplites begin to push with their spears and spear shafts against
    their opponents' shields. \n\nThis could be the longest phase.Pararrhexis: 'Breaching'
    the opposing phalanx, the enemy formation shatters and the battle ends. \n\nCavalry
    would be used at this point to mop up the scattered enemy.\n\n\n== Tactics ==\n\nThe
    early history of the phalanx is largely one of combat between hoplite armies
    from competing Greek city-states. \n\nThe usual result was rather identical,
    inflexible formations pushing against each other until one broke. \n\nThe potential
    of the phalanx to achieve something more was demonstrated at Battle of Marathon
    (490 BC). \n\nFacing the much larger army of Darius I, the Athenians thinned
    out their phalanx and consequently lengthened their front, to avoid being outflanked.
    \n\nHowever, even a reduced-depth phalanx proved unstoppable to the lightly armed
    Persian infantry. \n\nAfter routing the Persian wings, the hoplites on the Athenian
    wings wheeled inwards, destroying the elite troop at the Persian centre, resulting
    in a crushing victory for Athens. \n\nThroughout the Greco-Persian Wars the hoplite
    phalanx was to prove superior to the Persian infantry (e.g. the battles of Thermopylae
    and Plataea).\nPerhaps the most prominent example of the phalanx's evolution
    was the oblique order, made famous in the Battle of Leuctra. \n\nThere, the Theban
    general Epaminondas thinned out the right flank and centre of his phalanx, and
    deepened his left flank to an unheard-of 50 men deep. \n\nIn doing so, Epaminondas
    reversed the convention by which the right flank of the phalanx was strongest.
    \n\nThis allowed the Thebans to assault in strength the elite Spartan troops
    on the right flank of the opposing phalanx. \n\nMeanwhile, the centre and right
    flank of the Theban line were echeloned back, from the opposing phalanx, keeping
    the weakened parts of the formation from being engaged. \n\nOnce the Spartan
    right had been routed by the Theban left, the remainder of the Spartan line also
    broke. \n\nThus, by localising the attacking power of the hoplites, Epaminondas
    was able to defeat an enemy previously thought invincible.\nPhilip II of Macedon
    spent several years in Thebes as a hostage, and paid attention to Epaminondas'
    innovations. \n\nOn return to his homeland, he raised a revolutionary new infantry
    force, which was to change the face of the Greek world. \n\nPhilip's phalangites
    were the first force of professional soldiers seen in Ancient Greece apart from
    Sparta. \n\nThey were armed with longer spears (the sarissa) and were drilled
    more thoroughly in more evolved, complicated tactics and manoeuvres. \n\nMore
    importantly, though, Philip's phalanx was part of a multi-faceted, combined force
    that included a variety of skirmishers and cavalry, most notably the famous Companion
    cavalry. \n\nThe Macedonian phalanx now was used to pin the centre of the enemy
    line, while cavalry and more mobile infantry struck at the foe's flanks. \n\nIts
    supremacy over the more static armies fielded by the Greek city-states was shown
    at the Battle of Chaeronea, where Philip II's army crushed the allied Theban
    and Athenian phalanxes.\n\n\n== Weaknesses ==\n\nThe hoplite phalanx was weakest
    when facing an enemy fielding lighter and more flexible troops without its own
    such supporting troops. \n\nAn example of this would be the Battle of Lechaeum,
    where an Athenian contingent led by Iphicrates routed an entire Spartan mora
    (a unit of anywhere from 500 to 900 hoplites). \n\nThe Athenian force had a considerable
    proportion of light missile troops armed with javelins and bows that wore down
    the Spartans with repeated attacks, causing disarray in the Spartan ranks and
    an eventual rout when they spotted Athenian heavy infantry reinforcements trying
    to flank them by boat.\nThe Macedonian phalanx had weaknesses similar to its
    hoplitic predecessor. \n\nTheoretically indestructible from the front, its flanks
    and rear were very vulnerable, and once engaged it may not easily disengage or
    redeploy to face a threat from those directions. \n\nThus, a phalanx facing non-phalangite
    formations required some sort of protection on its flanks\u2014lighter or at
    least more mobile infantry, cavalry, etc. \n\nThis was shown at the Battle of
    Magnesia, where, once the Seleucid supporting cavalry elements were driven off,
    the phalanx was static and unable to go on the offensive against its Roman opponents
    (although they continued to resist stoutly and attempted a fighting withdrawal
    under a hail of Roman missiles, until the elephants posted on their flanks panicked
    and disrupted their formation).\nThe Macedonian phalanx could also lose its cohesion
    without proper coordination or while moving through broken terrain; doing so
    could create gaps between individual blocks/syntagmata, or could prevent a solid
    front within those sub-units as well, causing other sections of the line to bunch
    up. \n\nIn this event, as in the battles of Cynoscephalae and Pydna, the phalanx
    became vulnerable to attacks by more flexible units\u2014such as Roman legionary
    centuries, which were able to avoid the sarissae and engage in hand-to-hand combat
    with the phalangites.\nAnother important area that must be considered concerns
    the psychological tendencies of the hoplites. \n\nBecause the strength of a phalanx
    depended on the ability of the hoplites to maintain their frontline, it was crucial
    that a phalanx be able to quickly and efficiently replace fallen soldiers in
    the front ranks. \n\nIf a phalanx failed to do this in a structured manner, the
    opposing phalanx would have an opportunity to breach the line which, many times,
    would lead to a quick defeat. \n\nThis then implies that the hoplites ranks closer
    to the front must be mentally prepared to replace their fallen comrade and adapt
    to his new position without disrupting the structure of the frontline.Finally,
    most of the phalanx-centric armies tended to lack supporting echelons behind
    the main line of battle. \n\nThis meant that breaking through the line of battle
    or compromising one of its flanks often ensured victory.\n\n\n== Classical decline
    and post-classical use ==\n\nAfter reaching its zenith in the conquests of Alexander
    the Great, the phalanx began a slow decline, as Macedonian successor states declined.
    \n\nThe combined arms tactics used by Alexander and his father were gradually
    replaced by a return to the simpler frontal charge tactics of the hoplite phalanx.
    \n\nThe expense of the supporting arms and cavalry, and the widespread use of
    mercenaries, caused the Diadochi to rely on phalanx vs. phalanx tactics during
    the Wars of the Diadochi.\nThe decline of the Diadochi and the phalanx was linked
    with the rise of Rome and the Roman legions from the 3rd century BC. \n\nThe
    Battle of the Caudine Forks showed the clumsiness of the Roman phalanx against
    the Samnites. \n\nThe Romans had originally employed the phalanx themselves but
    gradually evolved more flexible tactics. \n\nThe result was the three-line Roman
    legion of the middle period of the Roman Republic, the Manipular System. \n\nRomans
    used a phalanx for their third military line, the triarii. \n\nThese were veteran
    reserve troops armed with the hastae or spear. \n\nRome conquered most of the
    Macedonian successor states. \n\nAlso the various Greek city-states and leagues.
    \n\nAs these states ceased to exist, so did the armies which used the traditional
    phalanx. \n\nSubsequently, troops from these regions were equipped, trained and
    fought using the Roman model.\nA phalanx formation called the phoulkon appeared
    in the late Roman army and Byzantine army. \n\nIt had characteristics of the
    classical Greek and Hellenistic phalanxes, but was more flexible. \n\nIt was
    used against cavalry more than infantry.\nHowever, the phalanx did not totally
    disappear. \n\nIn some battles between the Roman army and Hellenistic phalanxes,
    such as Pydna (168 BC), Cynoscephalae (197 BC) and Magnesia (190 BC), the phalanx
    performed well. \n\nIt even drove back the Roman infantry. \n\nHowever, at Cynoscephalae
    and Magnesia, failure to defend the flanks of the phalanx led to defeat. \n\nAt
    Pydna, the phalanx lost cohesion when pursuing retreating Roman soldiers. \n\nThis
    allowed the Romans to penetrate the formation. \n\nThen, Roman close combat skills
    proved decisive. \n\nThe historian Polybius details the effectiveness of the
    Roman legion against the phalanx. \n\nHe deduces that the Romans refused to fight
    the phalanx where the phalanx was effective, Romans offered battle only when
    a legion could exploit the clumsiness and immobility of a phalanx.\n\nSpear-armed
    troops continued to be important elements in many armies until reliable firearms
    became available. \n\nThese did not necessarily fight as a phalanx. \n\nFor example,
    compare the classical phalanx and late medieval pike formations.Military historians
    have suggested that the Scots under William Wallace and Robert the Bruce consciously
    imitated the Hellenistic phalanx to produce the Scots 'hedgehog' or schiltron.
    \n\nHowever, long spears might have been used by Picts and others in Scotlands'
    Early Middle Ages. \n\nPrior to 1066, long spear tactics (also found in North
    Wales) might have been part of irregular warfare in Britain. \n\nThe Scots used
    imported French pikes and dynamic tactics at the Battle of Flodden. \n\nHowever,
    Flodden found the Scots pitted against effective light artillery, while advancing
    over bad ground. \n\nThe combination disorganised the Scotts phalanxes and permitted
    effective attacks by English longbowmen, and soldiers wielding shorter, handier
    polearms called bills. \n\nSome contemporary sources might say that the bills
    cut off the heads of Scots pikes.\nThe pike was briefly reconsidered as a weapon
    by European armies in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. \n\nIt could protect
    riflemen, whose slower rate of fire made them vulnerable. \n\nA collapsible pike
    was invented but never issued. \n\nThe Confederate Army considered these for
    the American Civil War. \n\nSome were even manufactured but probably were never
    issued. \n\nPikes were manufactured during World War II as \"Croft's Pikes\".\nWhile
    obsolete in military practice, the phalanx remained in use as a metaphor of warriors
    moving forward as a single united block. \n\nThis metaphor inspired several 20th-century
    political movements, notably the Spanish Falange and its ideology of Falangism.\nThe
    Byzantines continued and improved the use of the classical Greek phalanx alongside
    the Macedonian-style phalanx. \n\nThe latter was based on a model that Alexander
    himself had created and had tried to give more importance to the skirmishers
    and cavalry, yet it never saw action until the Byzantines adopted the model that
    rely in a mixture of many units sometimes. \n\nMany writers of the age describe
    the spear as being a sarissa yet it was a meter short than the original sarissa
    and had being modified by the time, yet the term for the long spear remained
    alongside with its other names.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phalanx"

  descriptionText: "\n\nSPHENOID BONE\n\n\nThe sphenoid bone is an unpaired bone
    of the neurocranium. \n\nIt is situated in the middle of the skull towards the
    front, in front of the basilar part of the occipital bone. \n\nThe sphenoid bone
    is one of the seven bones that articulate to form the orbit. Its shape somewhat
    resembles that of a butterfly or bat with its wings extended.\n\n\n== Structure
    ==\n\nIt is divided into the following parts:\n\n-A median portion, known as
    the body of sphenoid bone, containing the sella turcica, which houses the pituitary
    gland as well as the paired paranasal sinuses, the sphenoidal sinuses.\n-Two
    greater wings on the lateral side of the body and two lesser wings from the anterior
    side.\n-Pterygoid processes of the sphenoides, directed downwards from the junction
    of the body and the greater wings.\n-Two sphenoidal conchae are situated at the
    anterior and inferior part of the body.\n\n\n=== Intrinsic ligaments of the sphenoid
    ===\n\nThe more important of these are: \n\n-The pterygospinous, stretching between
    the spina angularis and the lateral pterygoid plate see (cervical fascia);\n-The
    interclinoid, a fibrous process joining the anterior to the posterior clinoid
    process;\n-And the caroticoclinoid, connecting the anterior to the middle clinoid
    process.\n\nThese ligaments occasionally ossify.\n\n\n=== Features ===\n\n-pterygoid
    notch\n-pterygoid fossa\n-scaphoid fossa\n-pterygoid hamulus\n-pterygoid canal\n-pterygospinous
    process\n-sella turcica\n\n\n=== Articulations ===\n\nThe sphenoid articulates
    with the frontal, parietal, ethmoid, temporal, zygomatic, palatine, vomer, and
    occipital bones and helps to connect the neurocranium to the facial skeleton.\n\n\n==
    Body of sphenoid ==\n\n\n=== Superior or cerebral surface ===\n\nArticulates
    with ethmoid bone anteriorly and basilar part of occipital bone posteriorly.\n\nIt
    shows:\n\nJugum sphenoidale\nSulcus chiasmaticus\nTuberculum sellae\nSella turcica\nDorsum
    sellae\nClivus\n\n\n=== Inferior surface ===\n\nRostrum of sphenoid\nSphenoidal
    conchae\nVaginal processes of medial pterygoid plate\n\n\n=== Anterior surface
    ===\n\nSphenoidal crest articulates with the perpendicular plate of ethmoid leading
    to formation of a part of the septum of nose.\n\n\n=== Posterior surface ===\nBasilar
    part of occipital bone\n\n\n=== Lateral surface ===\n\nCarotid sulcus lodging
    cavernous sinus and internal carotid artery\n\n\n== Sphenoidal sinuses ==\n\nThese
    are asymmetrical air sinuses in the body of the sphenoid, closed by Sphenoidal
    conchae\n\n\n== Greater wings ==\n\n\n=== Superior or cerebral surface ===\n\nThis
    forms the floor of the middle cranial fossa.  It presents (starting from the
    front):\n\n-Foramen rotundum\n-Foramen ovale\n-Sphenoidal emissary foramen\n-Foramen
    spinosum\n\n\n=== Lateral surface ===\n\nThis is divided into (by infratemporal
    crest):\n\nUpper or temporal surface\nLower or infratemporal surfaceForamen pierce
    it:\n\nForamen ovale\nForamen spinosum\n\n\n=== Orbital surface ===\n\nThis forms
    the posterior wall of the orbit\n\n\n== Lesser wings ==\n\nThese are two triangular
    wings projecting laterally from anterosuperior part of the body.  Each consists
    of:\n\n-A base forming medial end of the wing.\n-Tip forming the lateral end
    of the wing.\n-Superior surface forming floor of anterior cranial fossa.\n-Inferior
    surface forming upper boundary of superior orbital fissure.\n-Posterior surface
    projects into the Sylvian point.\n-Medially, terminates in the anterior clinoid
    process.\n\n\n=== Development ===\n\nUntil the seventh or eighth month of fetal
    development, the body of the sphenoid consists of two parts: \n\n-One in front
    of the tuberculum sell\xE6, the presphenoid, with which the small wings are continuous;
    \n-The other, consisting of the sella turcica and dorsum sellae, the postsphenoid,
    with which are associated the great wings, and pterygoid processes.\n\nThe greater
    part of the bone is ossified in cartilage. There are fourteen centers in all,
    six for the presphenoid and eight for the postsphenoid.\n\n\n==== Presphenoid
    ====\n\nBy about the ninth week of fetal development an ossific center appears
    for each of the small wings (orbito-sphenoids) just lateral to the optic foramen;
    this is followed by the appearance of two nuclei in the presphenoid part of the
    body.\n\nThe sphenoidal conchae are each developed from a center that makes its
    appearance about the fifth month; at birth they consist of small triangular laminae,
    and it is not until the third year that they become hollowed out and coneshaped;
    about the fourth year they fuse with the labyrinths of the ethmoid bone, and
    between the ninth and twelfth years they unite with the sphenoid bone.\n\n\n====
    Postsphenoid ====\n\nThe first ossific nuclei are those for the great wings (alisphenoids).
    \n\nOne makes its appearance in each wing between the foramen rotundum and foramen
    ovale about the eighth week. \n\nThe orbital plate and that part of the sphenoid,
    which is found in the temporal fossa, as well as the lateral pterygoid plate,
    are ossified in membrane (Fawcett).\n\nSoon after, the centers for the postsphenoid
    part of the body appear, one on either side of the sella turcica, and become
    blended together about the middle of fetal life.\n\nEach medial pterygoid plate
    (except its hamulus) is ossified in membrane, and its center probably appears
    about the ninth or tenth week; the hamulus becomes chondrified during the third
    month, and almost at once ossifies (Fawcett).\n\nThe medial joins the lateral
    pterygoid plate about the sixth month.\nAbout the fourth month, a center appears
    for each lingula and speedily joins the rest of the bone.\n\nThe presphenoid
    is united to the postsphenoid about the eighth month, and at birth the sphenoid
    is in three pieces : \n    a central, consisting of the body and small wings,
    and two lateral, each comprising a great wing and pterygoid process.\n\nIn the
    first year after birth the great wings and body unite, and the small wings extend
    inward above the anterior part of the body, and, meeting with each other in the
    middle line, form an elevated smooth surface, termed the jugum sphenoidale.\n\nBy
    the twenty-fifth year the sphenoid and occipital are completely fused.\nBetween
    the pre- and postsphenoid there are occasionally seen the remains of a canal,
    the canalis cranio-pharyngeus, through which, in early fetal life, the hypophyseal
    diverticulum of the buccal ectoderm is transmitted.\n\nThe sphenoidal sinuses
    are present as minute cavities at the time of birth (Onodi), but do not attain
    their full size until after puberty.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\nThis bone assists
    with the formation of the base and the sides of the skull, and the floors and
    walls of the orbits. \n\nIt is the site of attachment for most of the muscles
    of mastication. Many foramina and fissures are located in the sphenoid that carry
    nerves and blood vessels of the head and neck, such as the superior orbital fissure
    (with ophthalmic nerve), foramen rotundum (with maxillary nerve) and foramen
    ovale (with mandibular nerve).\n\n\n== Other animals ==\n\nThe sphenoid bone
    of humans is homologous with a number of bones that are often separate in other
    animals, and have a somewhat complex arrangement.\n\nIn the early lobe-finned
    fishes and tetrapods, the pterygoid bones were flat, wing-like bones forming
    the major part of the roof of the mouth.  \n\nAbove the pterygoids were the epipterygoid
    bones, which formed part of a flexible joint between the braincase and the palatal
    region, as well as extending a vertical bar of bone towards the roof of the skull.
    \n\nBetween the pterygoids lay an elongated, narrow parasphenoid bone, which
    also spread over some of the lower surface of the braincase, and connected, at
    its forward end, with a sphenethmoid bone helping to protect the olfactory nerves.
    \n\nFinally, the basisphenoid bone formed part of the floor of the braincase
    and lay immediately above the parasphenoid.Aside from the loss of the flexible
    joint at the rear of the palate, this primitive pattern is broadly retained in
    reptiles, albeit with some individual modifications. \n\nIn birds, the epipterygoids
    are absent and the pterygoids considerably reduced. \n\nLiving amphibians have
    a relatively simplified skull in this region; a broad parasphenoid forms the
    floor of the braincase, the pterygoids are relatively small, and all other related
    bones except the sphenethmoid are absent.\n\nIn mammals, these various bones
    are often (though not always) fused into a single structure; the sphenoid. The
    basisphenoid forms the posterior part of the base, while the pterygoid processes
    represent the pterygoid bones. \n\nThe epipterygoids have extended into the wall
    of the cranium; they are referred to as alisphenoids when separate in mammals,
    and form the greater wings of the sphenoid when fused into a larger structure.
    \n\nThe sphenethmoid bone forms as three bones: the lesser wings and the anterior
    part of the base. \n\nThese two parts of the sphenethmoid may be distinguished
    as orbitosphenoids and presphenoid, respectively, although there is often some
    degree of fusion. \n\nOnly the parasphenoid appears to be entirely absent in
    mammals.In the dog the sphenoid is represented by 8 bones: \n    -basisphenoid,
    alisphenoids, presphenoid, orbitosphenoids, pterygoids. \n    \n    These bones
    remain separate and are the:\n\n2 Alisphenoids: each greater wing\n2 Orbitosphenoids:
    each lesser wing\nBasisphenoid: back part of body\nPresphenoid: front part of
    body\n2 Pterygoids: medial pterygoid plate\n\n== See also ==\n\nSphenoidal sinus\nPterygospinal

  descriptionText: "\n\nMETATARSAL BONES\n\n\nThe metatarsal bones, or metatarsus
    are a group of five long bones in the foot, located between the tarsal bones
    of the hind- and mid-foot and the phalanges of the toes. \n\nLacking individual
    names, the metatarsal bones are numbered from the medial side (the side of the
    great toe): the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth metatarsal (often depicted
    with Roman numerals). \n\nThe metatarsals are analogous to the metacarpal bones
    of the hand. \n\nThe lengths of the metatarsal bones in humans are, in descending
    order: second, third, fourth, fifth and first.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe five
    metatarsals are dorsally convex long bones consisting of a shaft or body, a base
    (proximally), and a head (distally). \n\nThe body is prismoid in form, tapers
    gradually from the tarsal to the phalangeal extremity, and is curved longitudinally,
    so as to be concave below, slightly convex above. \n\nThe base or posterior extremity
    is wedge-shaped, articulating proximally with the tarsal bones, and by its sides
    with the contiguous metatarsal bones: its dorsal and plantar surfaces are rough
    for the attachment of ligaments. \n\nThe head or distal extremity presents a
    convex articular surface, oblong from above downward, and extending farther backward
    below than above. \n\nIts sides are flattened, and on each is a depression, surmounted
    by a tubercle, for ligamentous attachment. \n\nIts plantar surface is grooved
    antero-posteriorly for the passage of the flexor tendons, and marked on either
    side by an articular eminence continuous with the terminal articular surface.\n\nDuring
    growth, the growth plates are located distally on the metatarsals, except on
    the first metatarsal where it is located proximally. \n\nYet it is quite common
    to have an accessory growth plate on the distal first metatarsal.\n\n\n=== Articulations
    ===\n\n\nThe base of each metatarsal bone articulates with one or more of the
    tarsal bones at the tarsometatarsal joints, and the head with one of the first
    row of phalanges at the metatarsophalangeal joints. \n\nTheir bases also articulate
    with each other at the intermetatarsal joints\n\n-The first metatarsal articulates
    with the medial cuneiform, and to a small extent to the intermediate cuneiform.\n-the
    second with all three cuneiforms.\n-the third with the lateral cuneiform.\n-the
    fourth with the lateral cuneiform and the cuboid.\n-The fifth with the cuboid.\n\n\n==
    Clinical significance ==\n\n=== Injuries ===\n\nThe metatarsal bones are often
    broken by association football players. \n\nThese and other recent cases have
    been attributed to the lightweight design of modern football boots, which provide
    less protection to the foot. \n\nIn 2010 some soccer players began testing a
    new sock that incorporated a rubber silicone pad over the foot to provide protection
    to the top of the foot. \n\nStress fractures are thought to account for 16% of
    injuries related to sports participation, and the metatarsals are the bones most
    often involved. \n\nThese fractures are sometimes called march fractures, based
    on their traditional association with military recruits after long marches. \n\nThe
    second and third metatarsals are fixed while walking, thus these metatarsals
    are common sites of injury. \n\nThe fifth metatarsal may be fractured if the
    foot is oversupinated during locomotion.Protection from injuries can be given
    by the use of safety footwear which can use built-in or removable metatarsal
    guards.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metatarsal_bones"

  descriptionText: "\n\nFEMUR\n\n\nThe femur (, pl. femurs or femora ), or thigh
    bone, is the proximal bone of the hindlimb in tetrapod vertebrates. \n\nThe head
    of the femur articulates with the acetabulum in the pelvic bone forming the hip
    joint, while the distal part of the femur articulates with the tibia (shinbone)
    and patella (kneecap), forming the knee joint. \n\nBy most measures the two (left
    and right) femurs are the strongest bones of the body, and in humans, the largest
    and thickest.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe femur is the only bone in the upper
    leg. The two femurs converge medially toward the knees, where they articulate
    with the proximal ends of the tibiae. \n\nThe angle of convergence of the femora
    is a major factor in determining the femoral-tibial angle. \n\nHuman females
    have thicker pelvic bones, causing their femora to converge more than in males.\n\nIn
    the condition genu valgum (knock knee) the femurs converge so much that the knees
    touch one another. \n\nThe opposite extreme is genu varum (bow-leggedness). \n\nIn
    the general population of people without either genu valgum or genu varum,  the
    femoral-tibial angle is about 175 degrees.\n\nThe femur is the largest and thickest
    bone in the human body. \n\nBy some measures, it is also the strongest bone in
    the human body. \n\nThis depends on the type of measurement taken to calculate
    strength. \n\nSome strength tests show the temporal bone in the skull to be the
    strongest bone. \n\nThe femur length on average is 26.74% of a person's height,
    a ratio found in both men and women and most ethnic groups with only restricted
    variation, and is useful in anthropology because it offers a basis for a reasonable
    estimate of a subject's height from an incomplete skeleton.\n\nThe femur is categorised
    as a long bone and comprises a diaphysis (shaft or body) and two epiphyses (extremities)
    that articulate with adjacent bones in the hip and knee.\n\n\n=== Upper part
    ===\n\nThe upper or proximal extremity (close to the torso) contains the head,
    neck, the two trochanters and adjacent structures.\n\nThe upper extremity is
    the shortest femoral extremity, the lower extremity is the thickest femoral extremity.\n\nThe
    head of the femur, which articulates with the acetabulum of the pelvic bone,
    comprises two-thirds of a sphere. \n\nIt has a small groove, or fovea, connected
    through the round ligament to the sides of the acetabular notch. \n\nThe head
    of the femur is connected to the shaft through the neck or collum. \n\nThe neck
    is 4\u20135 cm. long and the diameter is smallest front to back and compressed
    at its middle. \n\nThe collum forms an angle with the shaft in about 130 degrees.
    This angle is highly variant. \n\nIn the infant it is about 150 degrees and in
    old age reduced to 120 degrees on average. An abnormal increase in the angle
    is known as coxa valga and an abnormal reduction is called coxa vara. \n\nBoth
    the head and neck of the femur is vastly embedded in the hip musculature and
    can not be directly palpated. \n\nIn skinny people with the thigh laterally rotated,
    the head of the femur can be felt deep as a resistance profound (deep) for the
    femoral artery.\n\nThe transition area between the head and neck is quite rough
    due to attachment of muscles and the hip joint capsule. \n\nHere the two trochanters,
    greater and lesser trochanter, are found.\n\nThe greater trochanter is almost
    box-shaped and is the most lateral prominent of the femur. \n\nThe highest point
    of the greater trochanter is located higher than the collum and reaches the midpoint
    of the hip joint. The greater trochanter can easily be felt. \n\nThe trochanteric
    fossa is a deep depression bounded posteriorly by the intertrochanteric crest
    on the medial surface of the greater trochanter.\n\nThe lesser trochanter is
    a cone-shaped extension of the lowest part of the femur neck. \n\nThe two trochanters
    are joined by the intertrochanteric crest on the back side and by the intertrochanteric
    line on the front.\n\nA slight ridge is sometimes seen commencing about the middle
    of the intertrochanteric crest, and reaching vertically downward for about 5
    cm. along the back part of the body: it is called the linea quadrata (or quadrate
    line).\n\nAbout the junction of the upper one-third and lower two-thirds on the
    intertrochanteric crest is the quadrate tubercle located. \n\nThe size of the
    tubercle varies and it is not always located on the intertrochanteric crest and
    that also adjacent areas can be part of the quadrate tubercle, such as the posterior
    surface of the greater trochanter or the neck of the femur. \n\nIn a small anatomical
    study it was shown that the epiphyseal line passes directly through the quadrate
    tubercle.\n\n\n=== Body ===\n\nThe body of the femur (or shaft) is large, thick
    and almost cylindrical in form. \n\nIt is a little broader above than in the
    center, broadest and somewhat flattened from before backward below. \n\nIt is
    slightly arched, so as to be convex in front, and concave behind, where it is
    strengthened by a prominent longitudinal ridge, the linea aspera which diverges
    proximally and distal as the medial and lateral ridge. \n\nProximally the lateral
    ridge of the linea aspera becomes the gluteal tuberosity while the medial ridge
    continues as the pectineal line. \n\nBesides the linea aspera the shaft has two
    other bordes; a lateral and medial border. \n\nThese three bordes separates the
    shaft into three surfaces: One anterior, one medial and one lateral. \n\nDue
    to the vast musculature of the thigh the shaft can not be palpated.\n\nThe third
    trochanter is a bony projection occasionally present on the proximal femur near
    the superior border of the gluteal tuberosity. \n\nWhen present, it is oblong,
    rounded, or conical in shape and sometimes continuous with the gluteal ridge.
    \n\nA structure of minor importance in humans, the incidence of the third trochanter
    varies from 17\u201372% between ethnic groups and it is frequently reported as
    more common in females than in males.\n\n\n=== Lower part ===\n\nThe lower extremity
    of the femur (or distal extremity) is the thickest femoral extremity, the upper
    extremity is the shortest femoral extremity. \n\nIt is somewhat cuboid in form,
    but its transverse diameter is greater than its antero-posterior (front to back).
    \n\nIt consists of two oblong eminences known as the condyles.\n\nAnteriorly,
    the condyles are slightly prominent and are separated by a smooth shallow articular
    depression called the patellar surface. \n\nPosteriorly, they project considerably
    and a deep notch, the Intercondylar fossa of femur, is present between them.
    \n\nThe lateral condyle is the more prominent and is the broader both in its
    antero-posterior and transverse diameters. \n\nThe medial condyle is the longer
    and, when the femur is held with its body perpendicular, projects to a lower
    level. \n\nWhen, however, the femur is in its natural oblique position the lower
    surfaces of the two condyles lie practically in the same horizontal plane. \n\nThe
    condyles are not quite parallel with one another; the long axis of the lateral
    is almost directly antero-posterior, but that of the medial runs backward and
    medialward. \n\nTheir opposed surfaces are small, rough, and concave, and form
    the walls of the intercondyloid fossa. \n\nThis fossa is limited above by a ridge,
    the intercondyloid line, and below by the central part of the posterior margin
    of the patellar surface. \n\nThe posterior cruciate ligament of the knee joint
    is attached to the lower and front part of the medial wall of the fossa and the
    anterior cruciate ligament to an impression on the upper and back part of its
    lateral wall.\n\nThe articular surface of the lower end of the femur occupies
    the anterior, inferior, and posterior surfaces of the condyles. \n\nIts front
    part is named the patellar surface and articulates with the patella; it presents
    a median groove which extends downward to the intercondyloid fossa and two convexities,
    the lateral of which is broader, more prominent, and extends farther upward than
    the medial.\n\nEach condyle is surmounted by an elevation, the epicondyle. The
    medial epicondyle is a large convex eminence to which the tibial collateral ligament
    of the knee-joint is attached. \n\nAt its upper part is the adductor tubercle
    and behind it is a rough impression which gives origin to the medial head of
    the gastrocnemius. \n\nThe lateral epicondyle which is smaller and less prominent
    than the medial, gives attachment to the fibular collateral ligament of the knee-joint.\n\n\n===
    Development ===\n\nThe femur develops from the limb buds as a result of interactions
    between the ectoderm and the underlying mesoderm, formation occurs roughly around
    the fourth week of development.\n\nBy the sixth week of development, the first
    hyaline cartilage model of the femur is formed by chondrocytes. \n\nEndochondral
    ossification begins by the end of the embryonic period and primary ossification
    centers are present in all long bones of the limbs, including the femur, by the
    12th week of development. \n\nThe hindlimb development lags behind forelimb development
    by 1\u20132 days.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\nAs the femur is the only bone in the
    thigh, it serves as an attachment point for all the muscles that exert their
    force over the hip and knee joints. \n\nSome biarticular muscles \u2013 which
    cross two joints, like the gastrocnemius and plantaris muscles \u2013 also originate
    from the femur. \n\nIn all, 23 individual muscles either originate from or insert
    onto the femur.\n\nIn cross-section, the thigh is divided up into three separate
    fascial compartments divided by fascia, each containing muscles. \n\nThese compartments
    use the femur as an axis, and are separated by tough connective tissue membranes
    (or septa). \n\nEach of these compartments has its own blood and nerve supply,
    and contains a different group of muscles. \n\nThese compartments are named the
    anterior, medial and posterior fascial compartments.\n\n\n=== Fractures ===\n\nA
    femoral fracture that involves the femoral head, femoral neck or the shaft of
    the femur immediately below the lesser trochanter may be classified as a hip
    fracture, especially when associated with osteoporosis.  \n\nFemur fractures
    can be managed in a pre-hospital setting with the use of a traction splint.\n\n\n==
    Diversity among animals ==\n\nIn primitive tetrapods, the main points of muscle
    attachment along the femur are the internal trochanter and third trochanter,
    and a ridge along the ventral surface of the femoral shaft referred to as the
    adductor crest. \n\nThe neck of the femur is generally minimal or absent in the
    most primitive forms, reflecting a simple attachment to the acetabulum. \n\nThe
    greater trochanter was present in the extinct archosaurs, as well as in modern
    birds and mammals, being associated with the loss of the primitive sprawling
    gait. \n\nThe lesser trochanter is a unique development of mammals, which lack
    both the internal and fourth trochanters. \n\nThe adductor crest is also often
    absent in mammals or alternatively reduced to a series of creases along the surface
    of the bone. \n\nStructures analogous to the third trochanter are present in
    mammals, including some primates.\n\nSome species of whales, snakes, and other
    non-walking vertebrates have vestigial femurs. \n\nIn some snakes the protruding
    end of a pelvic spur, a vestigial pelvis and femur remnant which is not connected
    to the rest of the skeleton, plays a role in mating. \n\nThis role in mating
    is hypothesized to have possibly occurred in Basilosauridae, an extinct family
    of whales with well-defined femurs, lower legs and feet. \n\nOccasionally, the
    genes that code for longer extremities cause a modern whale to develop miniature
    legs (atavism).\n\nOne of the earliest known vertebrates to have a femur is the
    eusthenopteron, a prehistoric lobe-finned fish from the Late Devonian period.\n\n\n===
    Invertebrates ===\n\nIn invertebrate zoology the name femur appears in arthropodology.
    \n\nThe usage is not homologous with that of vertebrate anatomy; the term \"femur\"
    simply has been adopted by analogy and refers, where applicable, to the most
    proximal of (usually) the two longest jointed segments of the legs of the arthropoda.
    \n\nThe two basal segments preceding the femur are the coxa and trochanter. \n\nThis
    convention is not followed in carcinology but it applies in arachnology and entomology.
    \n\nIn myriapodology another segment, the prefemur, connects the trochanter and
    femur.\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"

    INTERMEDIATE CUNEIFORM BONE



    There are three cuneiform
    ("wedge-shaped") bones in the human foot:


    -the first or medial cuneiform

    -the
    second or intermediate cuneiform, also known as the middle cuneiform

    -the
    third or lateral cuneiformThey are located between the navicular bone and the
    first, second and third metatarsal bones and are medial to the cuboid bone.



    ==
    Structure ==


    The intermediate cuneiform is situated between the other two
    cuneiform bones (the medial and lateral cuneiforms), and articulates with the
    navicular posteriorly, the second metatarsal anteriorly and with the other cuneiforms
    on either side.

  descriptionText: "\n\nPHALANX\n\n\nThe phalanx (Ancient Greek: \u03C6\u03AC\u03BB\u03B1\u03B3\u03BE;
    plural phalanxes or phalanges, \u03C6\u03AC\u03BB\u03B1\u03B3\u03B3\u03B5\u03C2,
    phalanges) was a rectangular mass military formation, usually composed entirely
    of heavy infantry armed with spears, pikes, sarissas, or similar pole weapons.
    \n\nThe term is particularly used to describe the use of this formation in Ancient
    Greek warfare, although the ancient Greek writers used it to also describe any
    massed infantry formation, regardless of its equipment. \n\nArrian uses the term
    in his Array against the Alans when he refers to his legions. \n\nIn Greek texts,
    the phalanx may be deployed for battle, on the march, or even camped, thus describing
    the mass of infantry or cavalry that would deploy in line during battle. \n\nThey
    marched forward as one entity. \nThe term itself, as used today, does not refer
    to a distinctive military unit or division (e.g., the Roman legion or the contemporary
    Western-type battalion), but to the type of formation of an army's troops. \n\nTherefore,
    this term does not indicate a standard combat strength or composition but includes
    the total number of infantry, which is deployed in a single formation known as
    a \"phalanx\".\nMany spear-armed troops historically fought in what might be
    termed phalanx-like formations. \n\nThis article focuses on the use of the military
    phalanx formation in Ancient Greece, the Hellenistic world, and other ancient
    states heavily influenced by Greek civilization.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe earliest
    known depiction of a phalanx-like formation occurs in a Sumerian stele from the
    25th century BC. \n\nHere the troops seem to have been equipped with spears,
    helmets, and large shields covering the whole body. \n\nAncient Egyptian infantry
    were known to have employed similar formations. \n\nThe first usage of the term
    phalanx comes from Homer's \"\u03C6\u03B1\u03BB\u03B1\u03B3\u03BE\", used to
    describe hoplites fighting in an organized battle line. \n\nHomer used the term
    to differentiate the formation-based combat from the individual duels so often
    found in his poems.Historians have not arrived at a consensus about the relationship
    between the Greek formation and these predecessors of the hoplites. \n\nThe principles
    of shield wall and spear hedge were almost universally known among the armies
    of major civilizations throughout history, and so the similarities may be related
    to convergent evolution instead of diffusion.\nTraditionally, historians date
    the origin of the hoplite phalanx of ancient Greece to the 8th century BC in
    Sparta, but this is under revision. \n\nIt is perhaps more likely that the formation
    was devised in the 7th century BC after the introduction of the aspis by the
    city of Argos, which would have made the formation possible. \n\nThis is further
    evidenced by the Chigi vase, dated to 650 BC, identifying hoplites armed with
    aspis, spear and panoply.Another possible theory as to the birth of Greek phalanx
    warfare stems from the idea that some of the basic aspects of the phalanx were
    present in earlier times yet were not fully developed due to the lack of appropriate
    technology. \n\nTwo of the basic tactics seen in earlier warfare include the
    principle of cohesion and the use of large groups of soldiers. \n\nThis would
    suggest that the Greek phalanx was rather the culmination and perfection of a
    slowly developed idea that originated many years earlier. \n\nAs weaponry and
    armour advanced through the years in different city-states, the phalanx became
    complex and effective.\n\n\n== Overview ==\n\nThe hoplite phalanx of the Archaic
    and Classical periods in Greece (c. 800\u2013350 BC) was the formation in which
    the hoplites would line up in ranks in close order. \n\nThe hoplites would lock
    their shields together, and the first few ranks of soldiers would project their
    spears out over the first rank of shields. \n\nThe phalanx therefore presented
    a shield wall and a mass of spear points to the enemy, making frontal assaults
    against it very difficult. \n\nIt also allowed a higher proportion of the soldiers
    to be actively engaged in combat at a given time (rather than just those in the
    front rank).\nBattles between two phalanxes usually took place in open, flat
    plains where it was easier to advance and stay in formation. \n\nRough terrain
    or hilly regions would have made it difficult to maintain a steady line and would
    have defeated the purpose of a phalanx. \n\nAs a result, battles between Greek
    city-states would not take place in just any location, nor would they be limited
    to sometimes obvious strategic points. \n\nRather, many times, the two opposing
    sides would find the most suitable piece of land where the conflict could be
    settled. \n\nTypically, the battle ended with one of the two fighting forces
    fleeing to safety.The phalanx usually advanced at a walking pace, although it
    is possible that they picked up speed during the last several yards. \n\nOne
    of the main reasons for this slow approach was to maintain formation. \n\nThe
    formation would be rendered useless if the phalanx was lost as the unit approached
    the enemy and could even become detrimental to the advancing unit, resulting
    in a weaker formation that was easier for an enemy force to break through. \n\nIf
    the hoplites of the phalanx were to pick up speed toward the latter part of the
    advance, it would have been for the purpose of gaining momentum against the enemy
    in the initial collision. \n\nHerodotus states of the Greeks at the Battle of
    Marathon, that \"They were the first Greeks we know of to charge their enemy
    at a run\". \n\nMany historians believe that this innovation was precipitated
    by their desire to minimize their losses from Persian archery. \n\nThe opposing
    sides would collide, possibly severing many of the spears of the row in front
    and killing the front part of the enemy army due to the bone-breaking collision.\nThe
    spears of a phalanx had spiked butts. \n\nIn battle, the back ranks used the
    spikes to finish fallen enemy soldiers.\n\n\n=== Pushing ===\n\nThe \"physical
    pushing match\" theory is one where the battle would rely on the valour of the
    men in the front line, whilst those in the rear maintained forward pressure on
    the front ranks with their shields, and the whole formation would consistently
    press forward trying to break the enemy formation. \n\nThis is the most widely
    accepted interpretation of the ancient sources thus when two phalanx formations
    engaged, the struggle essentially became a pushing match. \n\nHistorians such
    as Victor Davis Hanson point out that it is difficult to account for exceptionally
    deep phalanx formations unless they were necessary to facilitate the physical
    pushing depicted by this theory, as those behind the first two ranks could not
    take part in the actual spear thrusting.No Greek art ever depicts anything like
    a phalanx pushing match, so this hypothesis is a product of educated speculation
    rather than explicit testimony from contemporary sources and is far from being
    academically resolved. \n\nThe Greek term for \"push\" was used in the same metaphorical
    manner as the English word is (for example it was also used to describe the process
    of rhetorical arguments) and so does not necessarily describe a literal physical
    push, although it is possible that it did.\nFor instance, if Othismos were to
    accurately describe a physical pushing match, it would be logical to state that
    the deeper phalanx would always win an engagement since the physical strength
    of individuals would not compensate for even one additional rank on the enemy
    side. \n\nHowever, there are numerous examples of shallow phalanxes holding off
    an opponent. \n\nFor instance, at Delium in 424 BC, the Athenian left flank,
    a formation eight men deep, held off a formation of Thebans 25 deep without immediate
    collapse. \n\nIt is difficult with the physical pushing model to imagine eight
    men withstanding the pushing force of 25 opponents for a matter of seconds, let
    alone half the battle.\nSuch arguments have led to a wave of counter-criticism
    to physical shoving theorists. \n\nAdrian Goldsworthy, in his article \"The Othismos,
    Myths and Heresies: The nature of Hoplite Battle\", argues that the physical
    pushing match model does not fit with the average casualty figures of hoplite
    warfare nor the practical realities of moving large formations of men in battle.
    \n\nThis debate has yet to be resolved amongst scholars.\nPractical difficulties
    with this theory also include the fact that, in a shoving match, an eight-foot
    spear is too long to fight effectively or even parry attacks. \n\nSpears enable
    a formation of men to keep their enemies at a distance, parry attacks aimed at
    them and their comrades, and give the necessary reach to strike multiple men
    in the opposite formation. \n\nA pushing match would put enemies so close together
    that a quick stabbing with a knife would kill the front row almost instantly.
    \n\nThe crush of men would also prevent the formation from withdrawing or retreating,
    which would result in much higher casualties than is recorded. \n\nThe speed
    at which this would occur would also end the battle very quickly, instead of
    prolonging it for hours.\n\n\n=== Shields ===\n\nEach individual hoplite carried
    his shield on his left arm, protecting not only himself but also the soldier
    to the left. \n\nThis meant that the men at the extreme right of the phalanx
    were only half-protected. \n\nIn battle, opposing phalanxes would try to exploit
    this weakness by attempting to overlap the enemy's right flank. \n\nIt also meant
    that, in battle, a phalanx would tend to drift to the right (as hoplites sought
    to remain behind the shield of their neighbor). \n\nSome groups, such as the
    Spartans at Nemea, tried to use this phenomenon to their advantage. \n\nIn this
    case, the phalanx would sacrifice its left side, which typically consisted of
    allied troops, in an effort to overtake the enemy from the flank. \n\nIt is unlikely
    that this strategy worked very often, as it is not mentioned frequently in ancient
    Greek literature.There was a leader in each row of a phalanx, and a rear rank
    officer, the ouragos (meaning tail-leader), who kept order in the rear. \n\nThe
    hoplites had to trust their neighbors to protect them and in turn be willing
    to protect their neighbors; a phalanx was thus only as strong as its weakest
    elements. \n\nThe effectiveness of the phalanx therefore depended on how well
    the hoplites could maintain this formation in combat and how well they could
    stand their ground, especially when engaged against another phalanx. \n\nFor
    this reason, the formation was deliberately organized to group friends and family
    close together, thus providing a psychological incentive to support one's fellows,
    and a disincentive, through shame, to panic or attempt to flee. \n\nThe more
    disciplined and courageous the army, the more likely it was to win \u2013 often
    engagements between the various city-states of Greece would be resolved by one
    side fleeing before the battle. \n\nThe Greek word dynamis, the 'will to fight',
    expresses the drive that kept hoplites in formation.\n\nNow of those, who dare,
    abiding one beside another, to advance to the close fray, and the foremost champions,
    fewer die, and they save the people in the rear; but in men that fear, all excellence
    is lost. \n\nNo one could ever in words go through those several ills, which
    befall a man, if he has been actuated by cowardice. \n\nFor 'tis grievous to
    wound in the rear the back of a flying man in hostile war. \n\nShameful too is
    a corpse lying low in the dust, wounded behind in the back by the point of a
    spear.\n\n\n=== Hoplite armament ===\n\nEach hoplite provided his own equipment.
    \n\nThe primary hoplite weapon was a spear around 2.4 metres (7.9 ft) in length
    called a dory. \n\nAlthough accounts of its length vary, it is usually now believed
    to have been seven to nine feet long (~2.1\u20132.7 m). \n\nIt was held one-handed,
    with the other hand holding the hoplite's shield (aspis). \n\nThe spearhead was
    usually a curved leaf shape, while the rear of the spear had a spike called a
    sauroter ('lizard-killer') which was used to stand the spear in the ground (hence
    the name). \n\nIt was also used as a secondary weapon if the main shaft snapped
    or to kill enemies lying on the ground. \n\nThis was a common problem, especially
    for soldiers who were involved in the initial clash with the enemy. \n\nDespite
    the snapping of the spear, hoplites could easily switch to the sauroter without
    great consequence. \n\nThe rear ranks used the secondary end to finish off fallen
    opponents as the phalanx advanced over them.\nThroughout the hoplite era, the
    standard hoplite armour went through many cyclical changes. \n\nAn Archaic hoplite
    typically wore a bronze breastplate, a bronze helmet with cheekplates, as well
    as greaves and other armour. \n\nLater, in the classical period, the breastplate
    became less common, replaced instead with a corselet that some claim was made
    of linothorax (layers of linen glued together), or perhaps of leather, sometimes
    covered in whole or in part with overlapping metal scales. \n\nEventually, even
    greaves became less commonly used, although degrees of heavier armour remained,
    as attested by Xenophon as late as 401 BC.These changes reflected the balancing
    of mobility with protection, especially as cavalry became more prominent in the
    Peloponnesian War and the need to combat light troops, which were increasingly
    used to negate the hoplite's role as the primary force in battle. \n\nYet bronze
    armour remained in some form until the end of the hoplite era. \n\nSome archaeologists
    have pointed out that bronze armour does not actually provide as much protection
    from direct blows as more extensive corselet padding, and have suggested its
    continued use was a matter of status for those who could afford it. \n\nIn the
    classical Greek dialect, there is no word for swordsmen; yet hoplites also carried
    a short sword called the xiphos, used as a secondary weapon if the dory was broken
    or lost. \n\nSamples of the xiphos recovered at excavation sites were typically
    around 60 cm (24 in) in length. \n\nThese swords were double-edged and could
    therefore be used as a cutting and thrusting weapon. \n\nThese short swords were
    often used to stab or cut at the enemy's neck during close combat.Hoplites carried
    a circular shield called a hoplon (often referred to as an aspis) made from wood
    and covered in bronze, measuring roughly 1 metre (3.3 ft) in diameter. \n\nIt
    spanned from chin to knee and was very heavy (8\u201315 kg (18\u201333 lb)).
    \n\nThis medium-sized shield (fairly large for the period considering the average
    male height) was made possible partly by its dish-like shape, which allowed it
    to be supported with the rim on the shoulder. \n\nThis was quite an important
    feature of the shield, especially for the hoplites that remained in the latter
    ranks. \n\nWhile these soldiers continued to help press forward, they did not
    have the added burden of holding up their shield. \n\nBut the circular shield
    was not without its disadvantages. \n\nDespite its mobility, protective curve,
    and double straps the circular shape created gaps in the shield wall at both
    its top and bottom. (Top gaps were somewhat reduced by the one or two spears
    jutting out of the gap. \n\nIn order to minimize the bottom gaps, thick leather
    'curtains' were used but only by an [unknown] percentage of the hoplites, possibly
    mostly in the first row only since there were disadvantages as well: considerable
    added weight on an already heavy shield and a certain additional cost.) These
    gaps left parts of the hoplite exposed to potentially lethal spear thrusts and
    were a persistent vulnerability for hoplites controlling the front lines.\n\n\n===
    Phalangite armament ===\n\nThe phalanx of the Ancient Macedonian kingdom and
    the later Hellenistic successor states was a development of the hoplite phalanx.
    \n\nThe 'phalangites' were armed with a much longer spear, the sarissa, and less
    heavily armoured. \n\nThe sarissa was the pike used by the ancient Macedonian
    army. \n\nIts actual length is unknown, but apparently it was twice as long as
    the dory. \n\nThis makes it at least 14 feet (4.3 m), but 18 feet (5.5 m) appears
    more likely. (The cavalry xyston was 12.5 feet (3.8 m) by comparison.) The great
    length of the pike was balanced by a counterweight at the rear end, which also
    functioned as a butt-spike, allowing the sarissa to be planted into the ground.
    \n\nBecause of its great length, weight and different balance, a sarissa was
    wielded two-handed. \n\nThis meant that the aspis was no longer a practical defence.
    \n\nInstead, the phalangites strapped a smaller pelte shield (usually reserved
    for peltasts, light skirmishers) to their left forearm. \n\nRecent theories,
    including examination of ancient frescoes depicting full sets of weapons and
    armor, claim that the shields used were actually larger than the pelte but smaller
    than the aspis, hanging by leather strap(s) from the left shoulder or from both
    shoulders. \n\nThe shield would retain handling straps in the inner curve, to
    be handled like a (smaller) aspis if the fight progressed to sword-wielding.
    \n\nAlthough in both shield size assumptions this reduced the shield wall, the
    extreme length of the spear kept the enemy at a greater distance, as the pikes
    of the first three to five ranks could all be brought to bear in front of the
    front row. \n\nThis pike had to be held underhand, as the shield would have obscured
    the soldier's vision had it been held overhead. \n\nIt would also be very hard
    to remove a sarissa from anything it stuck in (the earth, shields, and soldiers
    of the opposition) if it were thrust downwards, due to its length. \n\nThe Macedonian
    phalanx was much less able to form a shield wall, but the lengthened spears would
    have compensated for this. \n\nSuch a phalanx formation also reduced the likelihood
    that battles would degenerate into a pushing match.\n\n\n== Deployment and combat
    ==\n\n=== Phalanx composition and strength ===\n\nThe basic combat element of
    the Greek armies was either the stichos (meaning 'file'; usually 8\u201316 men
    strong) or the enomotia (meaning 'sworn' and made up by 2\u20134 stich\u0153,
    totaling up to 32 men), both led by a dim\u0153rites who was assisted by a decadarchos
    and two decaster\u0153 (sing. decasteros). \n\nFour to a maximum of 32 enomoti\xE6
    (depending on the era in question or the city) were forming a lochos led by a
    lochagos, who in this way was in command of initially 100 hoplites to a maximum
    of c. 500 in the late Hellenistic armies. \n\nHere, it has to be noted that the
    military manuals of Asclepiodotus and Aelian use the term lochos to denote a
    file in the phalanx. \n\nA taxis (mora for the Spartans) was the greatest standard
    hoplitic formation of 500 to 1500 men, led by a strategos (general). \n\nThe
    entire army, a total of several taxeis or mor\xE6 was led by a generals' council.
    \n\nThe commander-in-chief was usually called a polemarchos or a strategos autocrator.\n\n\n===
    Phalanx front and depth ===\n\nHoplite phalanxes usually deployed in ranks of
    eight men or more deep; the Macedonian phalanxes were usually 16 men deep, sometimes
    reported to have been arrayed 32 men deep. \n\nThere are some notable extremes;
    at the battles of Leuctra and Mantinea, the Theban general Epaminondas arranged
    the left wing of the phalanx into a \"hammerhead\" of 50 ranks of elite hoplites
    deep (see below) and when depth was less important, phalanxes just four deep
    are recorded, as at the battle of Marathon.The phalanx depth could vary depending
    on the needs of the moment and plans of the general. \n\nWhile the phalanx was
    in march, an eis bathos formation (loose, meaning literally 'in depth') was adopted
    in order to move more freely and maintain order. \n\nThis was also the initial
    battle formation as, in addition, it permitted friendly units to pass through
    whether assaulting or retreating. \n\nIn this status, the phalanx had twice the
    normal depth and each hoplite had to occupy about 1.8\u20132 metres (5 ft 11
    in\u20136 ft 7 in) in width. \n\nWhen enemy infantry was approaching, a rapid
    switch to the pycne (spelled also pucne) formation (dense or tight formation)
    was necessary. \n\nIn that case, each man's space was halved (0.9\u20131 metre
    or 2 feet 11 inches\u20133 feet 3 inches in width) and the formation depth returned
    to normal. \n\nAn even denser formation, the synaspismos or sunaspismos (ultra-tight
    or locked shields formation), was used when the phalanx was expected to experience
    extra pressure, intense missile volleys or frontal cavalry charges. \n\nIn synaspismos,
    the rank depth was half that of a normal phalanx and the width each man occupied
    was as small as 0.45 metres (1.5 ft).\n\n\n=== Stages of combat ===\n\nSeveral
    stages in hoplite combat can be defined:\nEphodos: The hoplites stop singing
    their p\xE6anes (battle hymns) and move towards the enemy, gradually picking
    up pace and momentum. \n\nIn the instants before impact, war cries (alalagm\u0153,
    sing. alalagmos) would be made. \n\nNotable war cries were the Athenian (eleleleleu!
    eleleleleu!) and the Macedonian (alalalalai! alalalalai!) alalagm\u0153.\nKrousis:
    The opposing phalanxes meet each other almost simultaneously along their front.
    \nDoratismos: Repeated, rapid spear thrusts in order to disrupt the enemy formation.
    \n\nThe use of long spears would keep enemies apart as well as allow men in a
    row to assist their comrades next to them. \n\nThe prodding could also open up
    a man to allow a comrade to spear him. \n\nToo hard prodding could get a spear
    stuck in a shield, which would necessitate someone in the back to lend his to
    the now-disarmed man.\nOthismos: Literally 'pushing' after most spears have been
    broken, the hoplites begin to push with their spears and spear shafts against
    their opponents' shields. \n\nThis could be the longest phase.Pararrhexis: 'Breaching'
    the opposing phalanx, the enemy formation shatters and the battle ends. \n\nCavalry
    would be used at this point to mop up the scattered enemy.\n\n\n== Tactics ==\n\nThe
    early history of the phalanx is largely one of combat between hoplite armies
    from competing Greek city-states. \n\nThe usual result was rather identical,
    inflexible formations pushing against each other until one broke. \n\nThe potential
    of the phalanx to achieve something more was demonstrated at Battle of Marathon
    (490 BC). \n\nFacing the much larger army of Darius I, the Athenians thinned
    out their phalanx and consequently lengthened their front, to avoid being outflanked.
    \n\nHowever, even a reduced-depth phalanx proved unstoppable to the lightly armed
    Persian infantry. \n\nAfter routing the Persian wings, the hoplites on the Athenian
    wings wheeled inwards, destroying the elite troop at the Persian centre, resulting
    in a crushing victory for Athens. \n\nThroughout the Greco-Persian Wars the hoplite
    phalanx was to prove superior to the Persian infantry (e.g. the battles of Thermopylae
    and Plataea).\nPerhaps the most prominent example of the phalanx's evolution
    was the oblique order, made famous in the Battle of Leuctra. \n\nThere, the Theban
    general Epaminondas thinned out the right flank and centre of his phalanx, and
    deepened his left flank to an unheard-of 50 men deep. \n\nIn doing so, Epaminondas
    reversed the convention by which the right flank of the phalanx was strongest.
    \n\nThis allowed the Thebans to assault in strength the elite Spartan troops
    on the right flank of the opposing phalanx. \n\nMeanwhile, the centre and right
    flank of the Theban line were echeloned back, from the opposing phalanx, keeping
    the weakened parts of the formation from being engaged. \n\nOnce the Spartan
    right had been routed by the Theban left, the remainder of the Spartan line also
    broke. \n\nThus, by localising the attacking power of the hoplites, Epaminondas
    was able to defeat an enemy previously thought invincible.\nPhilip II of Macedon
    spent several years in Thebes as a hostage, and paid attention to Epaminondas'
    innovations. \n\nOn return to his homeland, he raised a revolutionary new infantry
    force, which was to change the face of the Greek world. \n\nPhilip's phalangites
    were the first force of professional soldiers seen in Ancient Greece apart from
    Sparta. \n\nThey were armed with longer spears (the sarissa) and were drilled
    more thoroughly in more evolved, complicated tactics and manoeuvres. \n\nMore
    importantly, though, Philip's phalanx was part of a multi-faceted, combined force
    that included a variety of skirmishers and cavalry, most notably the famous Companion
    cavalry. \n\nThe Macedonian phalanx now was used to pin the centre of the enemy
    line, while cavalry and more mobile infantry struck at the foe's flanks. \n\nIts
    supremacy over the more static armies fielded by the Greek city-states was shown
    at the Battle of Chaeronea, where Philip II's army crushed the allied Theban
    and Athenian phalanxes.\n\n\n== Weaknesses ==\n\nThe hoplite phalanx was weakest
    when facing an enemy fielding lighter and more flexible troops without its own
    such supporting troops. \n\nAn example of this would be the Battle of Lechaeum,
    where an Athenian contingent led by Iphicrates routed an entire Spartan mora
    (a unit of anywhere from 500 to 900 hoplites). \n\nThe Athenian force had a considerable
    proportion of light missile troops armed with javelins and bows that wore down
    the Spartans with repeated attacks, causing disarray in the Spartan ranks and
    an eventual rout when they spotted Athenian heavy infantry reinforcements trying
    to flank them by boat.\nThe Macedonian phalanx had weaknesses similar to its
    hoplitic predecessor. \n\nTheoretically indestructible from the front, its flanks
    and rear were very vulnerable, and once engaged it may not easily disengage or
    redeploy to face a threat from those directions. \n\nThus, a phalanx facing non-phalangite
    formations required some sort of protection on its flanks\u2014lighter or at
    least more mobile infantry, cavalry, etc. \n\nThis was shown at the Battle of
    Magnesia, where, once the Seleucid supporting cavalry elements were driven off,
    the phalanx was static and unable to go on the offensive against its Roman opponents
    (although they continued to resist stoutly and attempted a fighting withdrawal
    under a hail of Roman missiles, until the elephants posted on their flanks panicked
    and disrupted their formation).\nThe Macedonian phalanx could also lose its cohesion
    without proper coordination or while moving through broken terrain; doing so
    could create gaps between individual blocks/syntagmata, or could prevent a solid
    front within those sub-units as well, causing other sections of the line to bunch
    up. \n\nIn this event, as in the battles of Cynoscephalae and Pydna, the phalanx
    became vulnerable to attacks by more flexible units\u2014such as Roman legionary
    centuries, which were able to avoid the sarissae and engage in hand-to-hand combat
    with the phalangites.\nAnother important area that must be considered concerns
    the psychological tendencies of the hoplites. \n\nBecause the strength of a phalanx
    depended on the ability of the hoplites to maintain their frontline, it was crucial
    that a phalanx be able to quickly and efficiently replace fallen soldiers in
    the front ranks. \n\nIf a phalanx failed to do this in a structured manner, the
    opposing phalanx would have an opportunity to breach the line which, many times,
    would lead to a quick defeat. \n\nThis then implies that the hoplites ranks closer
    to the front must be mentally prepared to replace their fallen comrade and adapt
    to his new position without disrupting the structure of the frontline.Finally,
    most of the phalanx-centric armies tended to lack supporting echelons behind
    the main line of battle. \n\nThis meant that breaking through the line of battle
    or compromising one of its flanks often ensured victory.\n\n\n== Classical decline
    and post-classical use ==\n\nAfter reaching its zenith in the conquests of Alexander
    the Great, the phalanx began a slow decline, as Macedonian successor states declined.
    \n\nThe combined arms tactics used by Alexander and his father were gradually
    replaced by a return to the simpler frontal charge tactics of the hoplite phalanx.
    \n\nThe expense of the supporting arms and cavalry, and the widespread use of
    mercenaries, caused the Diadochi to rely on phalanx vs. phalanx tactics during
    the Wars of the Diadochi.\nThe decline of the Diadochi and the phalanx was linked
    with the rise of Rome and the Roman legions from the 3rd century BC. \n\nThe
    Battle of the Caudine Forks showed the clumsiness of the Roman phalanx against
    the Samnites. \n\nThe Romans had originally employed the phalanx themselves but
    gradually evolved more flexible tactics. \n\nThe result was the three-line Roman
    legion of the middle period of the Roman Republic, the Manipular System. \n\nRomans
    used a phalanx for their third military line, the triarii. \n\nThese were veteran
    reserve troops armed with the hastae or spear. \n\nRome conquered most of the
    Macedonian successor states. \n\nAlso the various Greek city-states and leagues.
    \n\nAs these states ceased to exist, so did the armies which used the traditional
    phalanx. \n\nSubsequently, troops from these regions were equipped, trained and
    fought using the Roman model.\nA phalanx formation called the phoulkon appeared
    in the late Roman army and Byzantine army. \n\nIt had characteristics of the
    classical Greek and Hellenistic phalanxes, but was more flexible. \n\nIt was
    used against cavalry more than infantry.\nHowever, the phalanx did not totally
    disappear. \n\nIn some battles between the Roman army and Hellenistic phalanxes,
    such as Pydna (168 BC), Cynoscephalae (197 BC) and Magnesia (190 BC), the phalanx
    performed well. \n\nIt even drove back the Roman infantry. \n\nHowever, at Cynoscephalae
    and Magnesia, failure to defend the flanks of the phalanx led to defeat. \n\nAt
    Pydna, the phalanx lost cohesion when pursuing retreating Roman soldiers. \n\nThis
    allowed the Romans to penetrate the formation. \n\nThen, Roman close combat skills
    proved decisive. \n\nThe historian Polybius details the effectiveness of the
    Roman legion against the phalanx. \n\nHe deduces that the Romans refused to fight
    the phalanx where the phalanx was effective, Romans offered battle only when
    a legion could exploit the clumsiness and immobility of a phalanx.\n\nSpear-armed
    troops continued to be important elements in many armies until reliable firearms
    became available. \n\nThese did not necessarily fight as a phalanx. \n\nFor example,
    compare the classical phalanx and late medieval pike formations.Military historians
    have suggested that the Scots under William Wallace and Robert the Bruce consciously
    imitated the Hellenistic phalanx to produce the Scots 'hedgehog' or schiltron.
    \n\nHowever, long spears might have been used by Picts and others in Scotlands'
    Early Middle Ages. \n\nPrior to 1066, long spear tactics (also found in North
    Wales) might have been part of irregular warfare in Britain. \n\nThe Scots used
    imported French pikes and dynamic tactics at the Battle of Flodden. \n\nHowever,
    Flodden found the Scots pitted against effective light artillery, while advancing
    over bad ground. \n\nThe combination disorganised the Scotts phalanxes and permitted
    effective attacks by English longbowmen, and soldiers wielding shorter, handier
    polearms called bills. \n\nSome contemporary sources might say that the bills
    cut off the heads of Scots pikes.\nThe pike was briefly reconsidered as a weapon
    by European armies in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. \n\nIt could protect
    riflemen, whose slower rate of fire made them vulnerable. \n\nA collapsible pike
    was invented but never issued. \n\nThe Confederate Army considered these for
    the American Civil War. \n\nSome were even manufactured but probably were never
    issued. \n\nPikes were manufactured during World War II as \"Croft's Pikes\".\nWhile
    obsolete in military practice, the phalanx remained in use as a metaphor of warriors
    moving forward as a single united block. \n\nThis metaphor inspired several 20th-century
    political movements, notably the Spanish Falange and its ideology of Falangism.\nThe
    Byzantines continued and improved the use of the classical Greek phalanx alongside
    the Macedonian-style phalanx. \n\nThe latter was based on a model that Alexander
    himself had created and had tried to give more importance to the skirmishers
    and cavalry, yet it never saw action until the Byzantines adopted the model that
    rely in a mixture of many units sometimes. \n\nMany writers of the age describe
    the spear as being a sarissa yet it was a meter short than the original sarissa
    and had being modified by the time, yet the term for the long spear remained
    alongside with its other names.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phalanx"

  descriptionText: "\n\nINCISOR\n\n\nIncisors (from Latin incidere, \"to cut\") are
    the front teeth present in most mammals. \n\nThey are located in the premaxilla
    above and on the mandible below. \n\nHumans have a total of eight (two on each
    side, top and bottom). \n\nOpossums have 18, whereas armadillos have none.\n\n\n==
    Structure ==\n\nAdult humans normally have eight incisors, two of each type.
    \n\nThe types of incisor are:\n\nmaxillary central incisor (upper jaw, closest
    to the center of the lips)\nmaxillary lateral incisor (upper jaw, beside the
    maxillary central incisor)\nmandibular central incisor (lower jaw, closest to
    the center of the lips)\nmandibular lateral incisor (lower jaw, beside the mandibular
    central incisor)Children with a full set of deciduous teeth (primary teeth) also
    have eight incisors, named the same way as in permanent teeth. \n\nYoung children
    may have from zero to eight incisors depending on the stage of their tooth eruption
    and tooth development. \n\nTypically, the mandibular central incisors erupt first,
    followed by the maxillary central incisors, the mandibular lateral incisors and
    finally the maxillary laterals. \n\nThe rest of the primary dentition erupts
    after the incisors.Apart from the first molars, the incisors are also the first
    permanent teeth to erupt, following the same order as the primary teeth, among
    themselves.\n\n\n=== Other animals ===\n\nAmong other animals, the number varies
    from species to species. \n\nOpossums have 18, whereas armadillos have none.
    \n\nCats, dogs, foxes, pigs, and horses have twelve. \n\nRodents have four. \n\nRabbits
    and hares (lagomorphs) were once considered rodents, but are distinguished by
    having six\u2014one small pair, called \"peg teeth\", is located directly behind
    the most anterior pair. \n\nIncisors are used to bite off tough foods, such as
    red meat.\nCattle (cows, bulls, etc.) have none on top but a total of six on
    the bottom.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\nIn cats, the incisors are small; biting off
    meat is done with the canines and the carnassials. \n\nIn elephants, the upper
    incisors are modified into curved tusks (unlike with Narwhals, where it is a
    canine that develops into a straight and twisted tusk). \n\nThe incisors of rodents
    grow throughout life and are worn by gnawing. \n\nIn humans, the incisors serve
    to cut off pieces of food, as well as in the grip of other food items.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incisor"

  descriptionText: "\n\nMETACARPAL BONES\n\n\nIn human anatomy, the metacarpal bones
    or metacarpus, form the intermediate part of the skeletal hand located between
    the phalanges of the fingers and the carpal bones of the wrist which forms the
    connection to the forearm. \n\nThe metacarpal bones are analogous to the metatarsal
    bones in the foot.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\n\nThe metacarpals form a transverse
    arch to which the rigid row of distal carpal bones are fixed. \n\nThe peripheral
    metacarpals (those of the thumb and little finger) form the sides of the cup
    of the palmar gutter and as they are brought together they deepen this concavity.
    \n\nThe index metacarpal is the most firmly fixed, while the thumb metacarpal
    articulates with the trapezium and acts independently from the others. \n\nThe
    middle metacarpals are tightly united to the carpus by intrinsic interlocking
    bone elements at their bases. \n\nThe ring metacarpal is somewhat more mobile
    while the fifth metacarpal is semi-independent.Each metacarpal bone consists
    of a body or shaft, and two extremities: the head at the distal or digital end
    (near the fingers), and the base at the proximal or carpal end (close to the
    wrist).\n\n\n=== Body ===\n\nThe body (shaft) is prismoid in form, and curved,
    so as to be convex in the longitudinal direction behind, concave in front. \n\nIt
    presents three surfaces: medial, lateral, and dorsal.\n\nThe medial and lateral
    surfaces are concave, for the attachment of the interosseus muscles, and separated
    from one another by a prominent anterior ridge.\n\nThe dorsal surface presents
    in its distal two-thirds a smooth, triangular, flattened area which is covered
    in by the tendons of the extensor muscles. \n\nThis surface is bounded by two
    lines, which commence in small tubercles situated on either side of the digital
    extremity, and, passing upward, converge and meet some distance above the center
    of the bone and form a ridge which runs along the rest of the dorsal surface
    to the carpal extremity. \n\nThis ridge separates two sloping surfaces for the
    attachment of the interossei dorsales.\n\nTo the tubercles on the digital extremities
    are attached the collateral ligaments of the metacarpophalangeal joints.\n\n\n===
    Base ===\n\nThe base (basis) or carpal extremity is of a cuboidal form, and broader
    behind than in front: it articulates with the carpal bones and with the adjoining
    metacarpal bones; its dorsal and volar surfaces are rough, for the attachment
    of ligaments.\n\n\n=== Head ===\n\nThe head (caput) or digital extremity presents
    an oblong surface markedly convex from before backward, less so transversely,
    and flattened from side to side; it articulates with the proximal phalanx. \n\nIt
    is broader, and extends farther upward, on the volar than on the dorsal aspect,
    and is longer in the antero-posterior than in the transverse diameter. \n\nOn
    either side of the head is a tubercle for the attachment of the collateral ligament
    of the metacarpophalangeal joint.\n\nThe dorsal surface, broad and flat, supports
    the tendons of the extensor muscles.\n\nThe volar surface is grooved in the middle
    line for the passage of the flexor tendons, and marked on either side by an articular
    eminence continuous with the terminal articular surface.\n\n\n=== Neck ===\n\nThe
    neck, or subcapital segment, is the transition zone between the body and the
    head.\n\n\n=== Articulations ===\n\nBesides the metacarpophalangeal joints, the
    metacarpal bones articulate by carpometacarpal joints as follows:\n\n-the first
    with the trapezium;\n-the second with the trapezium, trapezoid, capitate and
    third metacarpal;\n-the third with the capitate and second and fourth metacarpals;\n-the
    fourth with the capitate, hamate, and third and fifth metacarpals;\n-and the
    fifth with the hamate and fourth metacarpal;\n        \n\n\n=== Insertions ===\n\n-Extensor
    Carpi Radialis Longus/Brevis: Both insert on the base of metacarpal II; Assist
    with wrist extension and radial flexion of the wrist\n-Extensor Carpi Ulnaris:
    Inserts on the base of metacarpal V; Extends and fixes wrist when digits are
    being flexed; assists with ulnar flexion of wrist\n-Abductor Pollicis Longus:
    Inserts on the trapezium and base of metacarpal I; Abducts thumb in frontal plane;
    extends thumb at carpometacarpal joint\n-Opponens Pollicis: Inserts on metacarpal
    I; flexes metacarpal I to oppose the thumb to the fingertips\n-Opponens digiti
    minimi: Inserts on the medial surface of metacarpal V; Flexes metacarpal V at
    carpometacarpal joint when little finger is moved into opposition with tip of
    thumb; deepens palm of hand.\n\n        \n\n\n== Clinical significance ==\n\n===
    Congenital disorders ===\n\nThe fourth and fifth metacarpal bones are commonly
    \"blunted\" or shortened, in pseudohypoparathyroidism and pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism.\n\nA
    blunted fourth metacarpal, with normal fifth metacarpal, can signify Turner syndrome.\n\nBlunted
    metacarpals (particularly the fourth metacarpal) are a symptom of Nevoid basal
    cell carcinoma syndrome.\n\n\n=== Fracture ===\n\nThe neck of a metacarpal is
    a common location for a boxer's fracture. \n\nHowever, all parts of the metacarpal
    bone (including head, body and base) are susceptible to fracture. \n\nFor these
    fractures several types of treatment exist ranging from non-operative techniques
    with or without immobilization to operative techniques using closed or open reduction
    and internal fixation (ORIF). \n\nGenerally speaking most fractures showing little
    or no displacement can be treated successfully without surgery. \n\nIntraarticular
    fracture-dislocations of the metacarpal head or base may require surgical fixation,
    as fragment displacement affecting the joint surface is rarely tolerated well.\n\n\n==
    Other animals ==\n\nIn four-legged animals, the metacarpals form part of the
    forefeet, and are frequently reduced in number, appropriate to the number of
    toes. \n\nIn digitigrade and unguligrade animals, the metacarpals are greatly
    extended and strengthened, forming an additional segment to the limb, a feature
    that typically enhances the animal's speed. \n\nIn both birds and bats, the metacarpals
    form part of the wing.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Etymology ===\n\nThe Greek physician
    Galen used to refer to the metacarpus as \u03BC\u03B5\u03C4\u03B1\u03BA\u03AC\u03C1\u03C0\u03B9\u03BF\u03BD.
    \n\nThe Latin form metacarpium more truly resembles its Ancient Greek predecessor
    \u03BC\u03B5\u03C4\u03B1\u03BA\u03AC\u03C1\u03C0\u03B9\u03BF\u03BD than metacarpus.
    \n\nMeta\u2013 is Greek for beyond and carpal from Ancient Greek \u03BA\u03B1\u03C1\u03C0\u03CC\u03C2
    (karp\xF3s, \u201Cwrist\u201D).\n\nIn anatomic Latin, adjectives like metacarpius,
    metacarpicus, metacarpiaeus, metacarpeus, metacarpianus and metacarpalis can
    be found. \n\nThe form metacarpius is more true to the later Greek form \u03BC\u03B5\u03C4\u03B1\u03BA\u03AC\u03C1\u03C0\u03B9\u03BF\u03C2.
    \n\nMetacarpalis, as in ossa metacarpalia in the current official Latin nomenclature,
    Terminologia Anatomica is a compound consisting of Latin and Greek parts. \n\nThe
    usage of such hybrids in anatomic Latin is disapproved by some.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacarpal_bones"

  descriptionText: "\n\nMETATARSAL BONES\n\n\nThe metatarsal bones, or metatarsus
    are a group of five long bones in the foot, located between the tarsal bones
    of the hind- and mid-foot and the phalanges of the toes. \n\nLacking individual
    names, the metatarsal bones are numbered from the medial side (the side of the
    great toe): the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth metatarsal (often depicted
    with Roman numerals). \n\nThe metatarsals are analogous to the metacarpal bones
    of the hand. \n\nThe lengths of the metatarsal bones in humans are, in descending
    order: second, third, fourth, fifth and first.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe five
    metatarsals are dorsally convex long bones consisting of a shaft or body, a base
    (proximally), and a head (distally). \n\nThe body is prismoid in form, tapers
    gradually from the tarsal to the phalangeal extremity, and is curved longitudinally,
    so as to be concave below, slightly convex above. \n\nThe base or posterior extremity
    is wedge-shaped, articulating proximally with the tarsal bones, and by its sides
    with the contiguous metatarsal bones: its dorsal and plantar surfaces are rough
    for the attachment of ligaments. \n\nThe head or distal extremity presents a
    convex articular surface, oblong from above downward, and extending farther backward
    below than above. \n\nIts sides are flattened, and on each is a depression, surmounted
    by a tubercle, for ligamentous attachment. \n\nIts plantar surface is grooved
    antero-posteriorly for the passage of the flexor tendons, and marked on either
    side by an articular eminence continuous with the terminal articular surface.\n\nDuring
    growth, the growth plates are located distally on the metatarsals, except on
    the first metatarsal where it is located proximally. \n\nYet it is quite common
    to have an accessory growth plate on the distal first metatarsal.\n\n\n=== Articulations
    ===\n\n\nThe base of each metatarsal bone articulates with one or more of the
    tarsal bones at the tarsometatarsal joints, and the head with one of the first
    row of phalanges at the metatarsophalangeal joints. \n\nTheir bases also articulate
    with each other at the intermetatarsal joints\n\n-The first metatarsal articulates
    with the medial cuneiform, and to a small extent to the intermediate cuneiform.\n-the
    second with all three cuneiforms.\n-the third with the lateral cuneiform.\n-the
    fourth with the lateral cuneiform and the cuboid.\n-The fifth with the cuboid.\n\n\n==
    Clinical significance ==\n\n=== Injuries ===\n\nThe metatarsal bones are often
    broken by association football players. \n\nThese and other recent cases have
    been attributed to the lightweight design of modern football boots, which provide
    less protection to the foot. \n\nIn 2010 some soccer players began testing a
    new sock that incorporated a rubber silicone pad over the foot to provide protection
    to the top of the foot. \n\nStress fractures are thought to account for 16% of
    injuries related to sports participation, and the metatarsals are the bones most
    often involved. \n\nThese fractures are sometimes called march fractures, based
    on their traditional association with military recruits after long marches. \n\nThe
    second and third metatarsals are fixed while walking, thus these metatarsals
    are common sites of injury. \n\nThe fifth metatarsal may be fractured if the
    foot is oversupinated during locomotion.Protection from injuries can be given
    by the use of safety footwear which can use built-in or removable metatarsal
    guards.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metatarsal_bones"

  descriptionText: "\n\nARYTENOID CARTILAGE\n\n\nThe arytenoid cartilages () are
    a pair of small three-sided pyramids which form part of the larynx. \n\nThey
    are the site of attachment of the vocal cords. \n\nEach is pyramidal or ladle-shaped
    and has three surfaces, a base, and an apex. \n\nThe arytenoid cartilages allow
    for movement of the vocal cords by articulating with the cricoid cartilage. \n\nIt
    may be affected by arthritis, dislocations, or sclerosis.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe
    arytenoid cartilages are part of the posterior part of the larynx.\n\n\n=== Surfaces
    ===\n\nThe posterior surface is triangular, smooth, concave, and gives attachment
    to the arytenoid muscle and transversus.\n\nThe antero-lateral surface is somewhat
    convex and rough. \n\nOn it, near the apex of the cartilage, is a rounded elevation
    (colliculus) from which a ridge (crista arcuata) curves at first backward and
    then downward and forward to the vocal process. \n\nThe lower part of this crest
    intervenes between two depressions or fove\xE6, an upper, triangular, and a lower
    oblong in shape; the latter gives attachment to the thyroarytenoid muscle (vocal
    muscle).\n\nThe medial surface is narrow, smooth, and flattened, covered by mucous
    membrane. \n\nIt forms the lateral boundary of the intercartilaginous part of
    the rima glottidis.\n\n\n=== Base and apex ===\n\nThe base of each cartilage
    is broad, and on it is a concave smooth surface, for articulation with the cricoid
    cartilage.\n\nIts lateral angle is called the muscular process.\nIts anterior
    angle is called the vocal process.\n\nThe apex of each cartilage is pointed,
    curved backward and medialward, and surmounted by a small conical, cartilaginous
    nodule, the corniculate cartilage. \n\nIt articulates with the cricoid lamina
    with a ball-and-socket joint.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\nThe arytenoid cartilages
    allow the vocal folds to be tensed, relaxed, or approximated. \n\nThey articulate
    with the supero-lateral parts of the cricoid cartilage lamina, forming the cricoarytenoid
    joints at which they can come together, move apart, tilt anteriorly or posteriorly,
    and rotate.\n\n\n== Clinical significance ==\n\n\n\n=== Arthritis ===\n\nRheumatoid
    arthritis and osteoarthritis can affect the cricoarytenoid joint. \n\nThis can
    cause airway obstruction, which may be life-threatening.\n\n\n=== Dislocation
    ===\n\nRarely, the arytenoid cartilage may be dislocated. \n\nThis is most often
    caused by tracheal intubation, major trauma to the larynx, or more rarely a laryngeal
    mask airway. \n\nThis may cause symptoms with problems breathing, such as \"breathiness\"
    when breathing. \n\nElectromyography and CT scans of the larynx may be used to
    assess a dislocation in detail. \n\nDislocations may be reduced using an endoscope.\n\n\n===
    Laryngeal cancer ===\n\nSome cases of laryngeal cancer cause the arytenoid cartilage
    to appear sclerotic. \n\nThis may be observed, and is highly predictive of laryngeal
    cancer.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n\n=== Etymology ===\n\nThe term \"arytenoid\"
    comes from Ancient Greek \u1F00\u03C1\u03CD\u03C4\u03B1\u03B9\u03BD\u03B1 arytaina
    meaning \"ladle\" and \u03B5\u1F36\u03B4\u03BF\u03C2 eidos, meaning \"form\".
    \n\nThey are also often described as \"pyramid\" shaped. \n\nThe word \"arytenoid\"
    is pronounced .\n\n\n== Other animals ==\n\nThe arytenoid cartilages are in the
    larynxes of many animals, including horses.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arytenoid_cartilage"

  descriptionText: "\n\nMOLAR (TOOTH)\n\n\nThe molars or molar teeth are large, flat
    teeth at the back of the mouth. \n\nThey are more developed in mammals. \n\nThey
    are used primarily to grind food during chewing. \n\nThe name molar derives from
    Latin, molaris dens, meaning \"millstone tooth\", from mola, millstone and dens,
    tooth. \n\nMolars show a great deal of diversity in size and shape across mammal
    groups. \n\nThe third molar of humans is sometimes vestigial.\n\n\n== Human anatomy
    ==\n\n\nIn humans, the molar teeth have either four or five cusps. \n\nAdult
    humans have 12 molars, in four groups of three at the back of the mouth. \n\nThe
    third, rearmost molar in each group is called a wisdom tooth. \n\nIt is the last
    tooth to appear, breaking through the front of the gum at about the age of 20,
    although this varies from individual to individual. \n\nRace can also affect
    the age at which this occurs, with statistical variations between groups. \n\nIn
    some cases, it may not even erupt at all.\nThe human mouth contains upper (maxillary)
    and lower (mandibular) molars. \n\nThey are: maxillary first molar, maxillary
    second molar, maxillary third molar, mandibular first molar, mandibular second
    molar, and mandibular third molar.\n\n\n== Mammal evolution ==\n\n\nIn mammals,
    the crown of the molars and premolars is folded into a wide range of complex
    shapes. \n\nThe basic elements of the crown are the more or less conical projections
    called cusps and the valleys that separate them. \n\nThe cusps contain both dentine
    and enamel, whereas minor projections on the crown, called crenulations, are
    the result of different enamel thickness. \n\nCusps are occasionally joined to
    form ridges and expanded to form crests. \n\nCingula are often incomplete ridges
    that pass around the base of the crown.Mammalian, multicusped cheek teeth probably
    evolved from single-cusped teeth in synapsids, although the diversity of therapsid
    molar patterns and the complexity in the molars of the earliest mammals make
    determining how this happened impossible. \n\nAccording to the widely accepted
    \"differentiation theory\", additional cusps have arisen by budding or outgrowth
    from the crown, while the rivalling \"concrescence theory\" instead proposes
    that complex teeth evolved by the clustering of originally separate conical teeth.
    \n\nTherian mammals (placentals and marsupials) are generally agreed to have
    evolved from an ancestor with tribosphenic cheek teeth, with three main cusps
    arranged in a triangle.\n\n\n== Morphology ==\n\n\nEach major cusp on an upper
    molar is called a cone and is identified by a prefix dependent on its relative
    location on the tooth: proto-, para-, meta-, hypo-, and ento-. \n\nSuffixes are
    added to these names: -id is added to cusps on a lower molar (e.g., protoconid);
    -ule to a minor cusp (e.g., protoconulid). \n\nA shelf-like ridge on the lower
    part of the crown (on an upper molar) is called a cingulum; the same feature
    on the lower molar a cingulid, and a minor cusp on these, for example, a cingular
    cuspule or conulid.\n\n\n=== Tribosphenic ===\n\n\nThe design that is considered
    one of the most important characteristics of mammals is a three-cusped shape
    called a tribosphenic molar. \n\nThis molar design has two important features:
    the trigonid, or shearing end, and the talonid, or crushing heel. \n\nIn modern
    tribosphenic molars, the trigonid is towards the front of the jaw and the talonid
    is towards the rear.\n\nThe tribosphenic tooth is found in insectivores and young
    platypuses (adults have no teeth). \n\nUpper molars look like three-pointed mountain
    ranges; lowers look like two peaks and a third off to the side.\nThe tribosphenic
    design appears primitively in all groups of mammals. \n\nSome paleontologists
    believe that it developed independently in monotremes (or australosphenidans),
    rather than being inherited from an ancestor that they share with marsupials
    and placentals (or boreosphenidans); but this idea has critics and the debate
    is still going on. \n\nFor example, the dentition of the Early Cretaceous monotreme
    Steropodon is similar to those of Peramus and dryolestoids, which suggests that
    monotremes are related to some pre-tribosphenic therian mammals, but, on the
    other hand, the status of neither of these two groups is well-established.\n\nSome
    Jurassic mammals, such as Shuotherium and Pseudotribos, have \"reversed tribosphenic\"
    molars, in which the talonid is towards the front. \n\nThis variant is regarded
    as an example of convergent evolution.From the primitive tribosphenic tooth,
    molars have diversified into several unique morphologies. \n\nIn many groups,
    a fourth cusp, the hypocone (hypoconid), subsequently evolved (see below).\n\n\n===
    Quadrate ===\n\n\nQuadrate (also called quadritubercular or euthemorphic) molars
    have an additional fourth cusp on the lingual (tongue) side called the hypocone,
    located posterior to the protocone. \n\nQuadrate molars appeared early in mammal
    evolution and are present in many species, including hedgehogs, raccoons, and
    many primates, including humans.\n\nThere may be a fifth cusp.\n\nIn many mammals,
    additional smaller cusps called conules appear between the larger cusps. \n\nThey
    are named after their locations, e.g. a paraconule is located between a paracone
    and a metacone, a hypoconulid is located between a hypoconid and an entoconid.\n\n\n===
    Bunodont ===\n\n\nIn bunodont molars, the cusps are low and rounded hills rather
    than sharp peaks. \n\nThey are most common among omnivores such as pigs, bears,
    and humans. \n\nBunodont molars are effective crushing devices and often basically
    quadrate in shape.\n\n\n=== Hypsodont ===\n\nHypsodont dentition is characterized
    by high-crowned teeth and enamel that extends far past the gum line, which provides
    extra material for wear and tear. \n\nSome examples of animals with hypsodont
    dentition are cattle and horses, all animals that feed on gritty, fibrous material.
    \n\nHypsodont molars can continue to grow throughout life, for example in some
    species of Arvicolinae (herbivorous rodents).Hypsodont molars lack both a crown
    and a neck. \n\nThe occlusal surface is rough and mostly flat, adapted for crushing
    and grinding plant material. \n\nThe body is covered with cementum both above
    and below the gingival line, below which is a layer of enamel covering the entire
    length of the body. \n\nThe cementum and the enamel invaginate into the thick
    layer of dentin.\n\n\n=== Brachydont ===\n\nThe opposite condition to hypsodont
    is called brachydont or brachyodont (from brachys 'short'). \n\nIt is a type
    of dentition characterized by low-crowned teeth. \n\nHuman teeth are brachydont.A
    brachydont tooth has a crown above the gingival line and a neck just below it,
    and at least one root. \n\nA cap of enamel covers the crown and extends down
    to the neck. \n\nCementum is only found below the gingival line. \n\nThe occlusal
    surfaces tend to be pointed, well-suited for holding prey and tearing and shredding.\n\n\n===
    Zalambdodont ===\n\nZalambdodont molars have three cusps, one larger on the lingual
    side and two smaller on the labial side, joined by two crests that form a V-
    or \u03BB-shape. \n\nThe larger inner cusp might be homologous with the paracone
    in a tribosphenic molar, but can also be fused with the metacone. \n\nThe protocone
    is typically missing. \n\nThe two smaller labial cusps are located on an expanded
    shelf called the stylar shelf. \n\nZalambdodont molars are found in, for example,
    golden moles and solenodons.\n\n\n=== Dilambdodont ===\n\nLike zalambdodont molars,
    dilambdodont molars have a distinct ectoloph, but are shaped like two lambdas
    or a W. \n\nOn the lingual side, at the bottom of the W, are the metacone and
    paracone, and the stylar shelf is on the labial side. \n\nA protocone is present
    lingual to the ectoloph. \n\nDilambdodont molars are present in shrews, moles,
    and some insectivorous bats.\n\n\n=== Lophodont ===\n\n\nLophodont teeth are
    easily identified by the differentiating patterns of ridges or lophs of enamel
    interconnecting the cusps on the crowns. \n\nPresent in most herbivores, these
    patterns of lophs can be a simple, ring-like edge, as in mole rats, or a complex
    arrangement of series of ridges and cross-ridges, as those in odd-toed ungulates,
    such as equids.Lophodont molars have hard and elongated enamel ridges called
    lophs oriented either along or perpendicular to the dental row. \n\nLophodont
    molars are common in herbivores that grind their food thoroughly. \n\nExamples
    include tapirs, manatees, and many rodents.When two lophs form transverse, often
    ring-shaped, ridges on a tooth, the arrangement is called bilophodont. \n\nThis
    pattern is common in primates, but can also be found in lagomorphs (hares, rabbits,
    and pikas) and some rodents.\n\nExtreme forms of lophodonty in elephants and
    some rodents (such as Otomys) is known as loxodonty. \n\nThe African elephant
    belongs to a genus called Loxodonta because of this feature.\n\n\n=== Selenodont
    ===\n\nIn selenodont molars (so-named after moon goddess Selene), the major cusp
    is elongated into crescent-shaped ridge. \n\nExamples include most even-toed
    ungulates, such as cattle and deer.\n\n\n=== Secodont ===\n\n\nMany carnivorous
    mammals have enlarged and blade-like teeth especially adapted for slicing and
    chopping called carnassials. \n\nA general term for such blade-like teeth is
    secodont or plagiaulacoid.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_(tooth)"

  descriptionText: "\n\nINCISOR\n\n\nIncisors (from Latin incidere, \"to cut\") are
    the front teeth present in most mammals. \n\nThey are located in the premaxilla
    above and on the mandible below. \n\nHumans have a total of eight (two on each
    side, top and bottom). \n\nOpossums have 18, whereas armadillos have none.\n\n\n==
    Structure ==\n\nAdult humans normally have eight incisors, two of each type.
    \n\nThe types of incisor are:\n\nmaxillary central incisor (upper jaw, closest
    to the center of the lips)\nmaxillary lateral incisor (upper jaw, beside the
    maxillary central incisor)\nmandibular central incisor (lower jaw, closest to
    the center of the lips)\nmandibular lateral incisor (lower jaw, beside the mandibular
    central incisor)Children with a full set of deciduous teeth (primary teeth) also
    have eight incisors, named the same way as in permanent teeth. \n\nYoung children
    may have from zero to eight incisors depending on the stage of their tooth eruption
    and tooth development. \n\nTypically, the mandibular central incisors erupt first,
    followed by the maxillary central incisors, the mandibular lateral incisors and
    finally the maxillary laterals. \n\nThe rest of the primary dentition erupts
    after the incisors.Apart from the first molars, the incisors are also the first
    permanent teeth to erupt, following the same order as the primary teeth, among
    themselves.\n\n\n=== Other animals ===\n\nAmong other animals, the number varies
    from species to species. \n\nOpossums have 18, whereas armadillos have none.
    \n\nCats, dogs, foxes, pigs, and horses have twelve. \n\nRodents have four. \n\nRabbits
    and hares (lagomorphs) were once considered rodents, but are distinguished by
    having six\u2014one small pair, called \"peg teeth\", is located directly behind
    the most anterior pair. \n\nIncisors are used to bite off tough foods, such as
    red meat.\nCattle (cows, bulls, etc.) have none on top but a total of six on
    the bottom.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\nIn cats, the incisors are small; biting off
    meat is done with the canines and the carnassials. \n\nIn elephants, the upper
    incisors are modified into curved tusks (unlike with Narwhals, where it is a
    canine that develops into a straight and twisted tusk). \n\nThe incisors of rodents
    grow throughout life and are worn by gnawing. \n\nIn humans, the incisors serve
    to cut off pieces of food, as well as in the grip of other food items.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incisor"

  descriptionText: "\n\nCAPITATE BONE\n\n\nThe capitate bone is found in the center
    of the carpal bone region, colloquially known as the wrist, which is at the distal
    end of the radius and ulna bones. \n\nIt articulates with the third metacarpal
    bone (the middle finger) and forms the third carpometacarpal joint. \n\nThe capitate
    bone is the largest of the carpal bones in the human hand. \n\nIt presents, above,
    a rounded portion or head, which is received into the concavity formed by the
    scaphoid and lunate bones; a constricted portion or neck; and below this, the
    body.\n\nThe bone is also found in many other mammals, and is homologous with
    the \"third distal carpal\" of reptiles and amphibians.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe
    capitate is the largest carpal bone found within the hand. \n\nThe capitate is
    found within the distal row of carpal bones. \n\nThe capitate lies directly adjacent
    to the metacarpal of the ring finger on its distal surface, has the hamate on
    its ulnar surface and trapezoid on its radial surface, and abuts the lunate and
    scaphoid proximally. \n\n\n=== Surfaces ===\n\nThe superior surface is round,
    smooth, and articulates with the lunate bone.\n\nThe inferior surface is divided
    by two ridges into three facets, for articulation with the second, third, and
    fourth metacarpal bones, that for the third being the largest.\n\nThe dorsal
    surface is broad and rough.The palmar surface is narrow, rounded, and rough,
    for the attachment of ligaments and a part of the adductor pollicis muscle.\n\nThe
    lateral surface articulates with the lesser multangular by a small facet at its
    anterior inferior angle, behind which is a rough depression for the attachment
    of an interosseous ligament. \n\nAbove this is a deep, rough groove, forming
    part of the neck, and serving for the attachment of ligaments; it is bounded
    superiorly by a smooth, convex surface, for articulation with the scaphoid bone.\n\nThe
    medial surface articulates with the hamate bone by a smooth, concave, oblong
    facet, which occupies its posterior and superior parts; it is rough in front,
    for the attachment of an interosseous ligament.\n\n\n=== Variation ===\n\nThe
    capitate bone variably articulates with the metacarpal of the index finger. \n\nHowever,
    its normal articulation is with the middle finger.\n\n\n=== Development ===\n\nThe
    ossification of capitate starts at 1 \u2013 5 months.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\nThe
    carpal bones function as a unit to provide a bony superstructure for the hand.
    :\u200A708\u200A They allow movements of the wrist from side to side (medial
    to lateral) as well as up and down (anterior to posterior). \n\n\nHarris wrote
    in the British Medical Journal in 1944 that \"the strength of construction of
    the hand in a man is concentrated in the radius, thumb, and index and middle
    fingers.\" \n\nTherefore, the capitate is larger to support the strength and
    stress that the middle finger undergoes.\n\n\n== Clinical significance ==\n\nA
    capitate fracture accounts for 1.3% of all wrist fractures. \n\nIsolated fractures
    of the capitate comprise only 0.3% and are often non-displace. \n\nThis is since
    the capitate is at the centre of the carpal region and is therefore quite well
    protected.\n\nCapitate fractures occur together with fractures of another carpal
    bone, the scaphoid.\n\nVarious mechanisms for fractures of the capitate have
    been postulated. \n\nAdler et al. described three mechanisms\u2014the first is
    direct trauma to the dorsal surface of the bone, the second is fall on the palm
    with the wrist in forced extension and the third is fall on the forcefully flexed
    hand; the second being the most frequent and the third rarest.\n\nIn the case
    of an acute capitate fracture where there is x-ray evidence of excellent alignment
    of the fracture fragments, the attending doctor will immobilise the wrist in
    a plaster or lightweight wrist brace. \n\nOnce the cast has been removed the
    patient begins physiotherapy to regain the range of movement of the wrist joint
    and strength in the muscles involved.\n\nIf x-rays show that the capitate fracture
    fragments are out of alignment, surgery is indicated. \n\nA surgeon can use small
    compression screws or K-wires to unite the two pieces of bone. \n\nThe headless
    compression screw has advantage over the K-wire as it provides compression across
    the fracture site and allows early motion. \n\nIt may be the case that the ligament
    between the \u0441apitate and the scaphoid bone is also injured; if so, this
    would be repaired at the same time.\n\nBecause the capitate has a poor blood
    supply there are sometimes complications with the healing process. \n\nThis may
    manifest itself as a diffuse ache in the wrist upon activity, and can persist
    for many months. \n\nThis is due to a breakdown of the capitate caused by the
    lack of blood supply and healing (avascular necrosis). \n\nNonunion has been
    reported as the most common complication; 19.6% to 56% in isolated capitate fractures.
    \n\nEarly diagnosis is key to preventing this.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe etymology
    derives from the Latin Latin: capit\u0101tus, \"having a head,\" from Latin:
    capit-, meaning \"head.\"\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitate_bone"

  descriptionText: "\n\nNASAL BONE\n\n\nThe nasal bones are two small oblong bones,
    varying in size and form in different individuals; they are placed side by side
    at the middle and upper part of the face and by their junction, form the bridge
    of the upper one third of the nose.\n\nEach has two surfaces and four borders.\n\n\n==
    Structure ==\n\nThe two nasal bones are joined at the midline internasal suture
    and make up the bridge of the nose.\n\n\n=== Surfaces ===\n\nThe outer surface
    is concavo-convex from above downward, convex from side to side; it is covered
    by the procerus and nasalis muscles, and perforated about its center by a foramen,
    for the transmission of a small vein.\nThe inner surface is concave from side
    to side, and is traversed from above downward, by a groove for the passage of
    a branch of the nasociliary nerve.\n\n\n=== Articulations ===\n\nThe nasal articulates
    with four bones: two of the cranium, the frontal and ethmoid, and two of the
    face, the opposite nasal and the maxilla.\n\n\n== Other animals ==\n\nIn primitive
    bony fish and tetrapods, the nasal bones are the most anterior of a set of four
    paired bones forming the roof of the skull, being followed in sequence by the
    frontals, the parietals, and the postparietals. \n\nTheir form in living species
    is highly variable, depending on the shape of the head, but they generally form
    the roof of the snout or beak, running from the nostrils to a position short
    of the orbits. \n\nIn most animals, they are generally therefore proportionally
    larger than in humans or great apes, because of the shortened faces of the latter.
    \n\nTurtles, unusually, lack nasal bones, with the prefrontal bones of the orbit
    reaching all the way to the nostrils.\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_bone"

  descriptionText: "\n\nPHALANX\n\n\nThe phalanx (Ancient Greek: \u03C6\u03AC\u03BB\u03B1\u03B3\u03BE;
    plural phalanxes or phalanges, \u03C6\u03AC\u03BB\u03B1\u03B3\u03B3\u03B5\u03C2,
    phalanges) was a rectangular mass military formation, usually composed entirely
    of heavy infantry armed with spears, pikes, sarissas, or similar pole weapons.
    \n\nThe term is particularly used to describe the use of this formation in Ancient
    Greek warfare, although the ancient Greek writers used it to also describe any
    massed infantry formation, regardless of its equipment. \n\nArrian uses the term
    in his Array against the Alans when he refers to his legions. \n\nIn Greek texts,
    the phalanx may be deployed for battle, on the march, or even camped, thus describing
    the mass of infantry or cavalry that would deploy in line during battle. \n\nThey
    marched forward as one entity. \nThe term itself, as used today, does not refer
    to a distinctive military unit or division (e.g., the Roman legion or the contemporary
    Western-type battalion), but to the type of formation of an army's troops. \n\nTherefore,
    this term does not indicate a standard combat strength or composition but includes
    the total number of infantry, which is deployed in a single formation known as
    a \"phalanx\".\nMany spear-armed troops historically fought in what might be
    termed phalanx-like formations. \n\nThis article focuses on the use of the military
    phalanx formation in Ancient Greece, the Hellenistic world, and other ancient
    states heavily influenced by Greek civilization.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe earliest
    known depiction of a phalanx-like formation occurs in a Sumerian stele from the
    25th century BC. \n\nHere the troops seem to have been equipped with spears,
    helmets, and large shields covering the whole body. \n\nAncient Egyptian infantry
    were known to have employed similar formations. \n\nThe first usage of the term
    phalanx comes from Homer's \"\u03C6\u03B1\u03BB\u03B1\u03B3\u03BE\", used to
    describe hoplites fighting in an organized battle line. \n\nHomer used the term
    to differentiate the formation-based combat from the individual duels so often
    found in his poems.Historians have not arrived at a consensus about the relationship
    between the Greek formation and these predecessors of the hoplites. \n\nThe principles
    of shield wall and spear hedge were almost universally known among the armies
    of major civilizations throughout history, and so the similarities may be related
    to convergent evolution instead of diffusion.\nTraditionally, historians date
    the origin of the hoplite phalanx of ancient Greece to the 8th century BC in
    Sparta, but this is under revision. \n\nIt is perhaps more likely that the formation
    was devised in the 7th century BC after the introduction of the aspis by the
    city of Argos, which would have made the formation possible. \n\nThis is further
    evidenced by the Chigi vase, dated to 650 BC, identifying hoplites armed with
    aspis, spear and panoply.Another possible theory as to the birth of Greek phalanx
    warfare stems from the idea that some of the basic aspects of the phalanx were
    present in earlier times yet were not fully developed due to the lack of appropriate
    technology. \n\nTwo of the basic tactics seen in earlier warfare include the
    principle of cohesion and the use of large groups of soldiers. \n\nThis would
    suggest that the Greek phalanx was rather the culmination and perfection of a
    slowly developed idea that originated many years earlier. \n\nAs weaponry and
    armour advanced through the years in different city-states, the phalanx became
    complex and effective.\n\n\n== Overview ==\n\nThe hoplite phalanx of the Archaic
    and Classical periods in Greece (c. 800\u2013350 BC) was the formation in which
    the hoplites would line up in ranks in close order. \n\nThe hoplites would lock
    their shields together, and the first few ranks of soldiers would project their
    spears out over the first rank of shields. \n\nThe phalanx therefore presented
    a shield wall and a mass of spear points to the enemy, making frontal assaults
    against it very difficult. \n\nIt also allowed a higher proportion of the soldiers
    to be actively engaged in combat at a given time (rather than just those in the
    front rank).\nBattles between two phalanxes usually took place in open, flat
    plains where it was easier to advance and stay in formation. \n\nRough terrain
    or hilly regions would have made it difficult to maintain a steady line and would
    have defeated the purpose of a phalanx. \n\nAs a result, battles between Greek
    city-states would not take place in just any location, nor would they be limited
    to sometimes obvious strategic points. \n\nRather, many times, the two opposing
    sides would find the most suitable piece of land where the conflict could be
    settled. \n\nTypically, the battle ended with one of the two fighting forces
    fleeing to safety.The phalanx usually advanced at a walking pace, although it
    is possible that they picked up speed during the last several yards. \n\nOne
    of the main reasons for this slow approach was to maintain formation. \n\nThe
    formation would be rendered useless if the phalanx was lost as the unit approached
    the enemy and could even become detrimental to the advancing unit, resulting
    in a weaker formation that was easier for an enemy force to break through. \n\nIf
    the hoplites of the phalanx were to pick up speed toward the latter part of the
    advance, it would have been for the purpose of gaining momentum against the enemy
    in the initial collision. \n\nHerodotus states of the Greeks at the Battle of
    Marathon, that \"They were the first Greeks we know of to charge their enemy
    at a run\". \n\nMany historians believe that this innovation was precipitated
    by their desire to minimize their losses from Persian archery. \n\nThe opposing
    sides would collide, possibly severing many of the spears of the row in front
    and killing the front part of the enemy army due to the bone-breaking collision.\nThe
    spears of a phalanx had spiked butts. \n\nIn battle, the back ranks used the
    spikes to finish fallen enemy soldiers.\n\n\n=== Pushing ===\n\nThe \"physical
    pushing match\" theory is one where the battle would rely on the valour of the
    men in the front line, whilst those in the rear maintained forward pressure on
    the front ranks with their shields, and the whole formation would consistently
    press forward trying to break the enemy formation. \n\nThis is the most widely
    accepted interpretation of the ancient sources thus when two phalanx formations
    engaged, the struggle essentially became a pushing match. \n\nHistorians such
    as Victor Davis Hanson point out that it is difficult to account for exceptionally
    deep phalanx formations unless they were necessary to facilitate the physical
    pushing depicted by this theory, as those behind the first two ranks could not
    take part in the actual spear thrusting.No Greek art ever depicts anything like
    a phalanx pushing match, so this hypothesis is a product of educated speculation
    rather than explicit testimony from contemporary sources and is far from being
    academically resolved. \n\nThe Greek term for \"push\" was used in the same metaphorical
    manner as the English word is (for example it was also used to describe the process
    of rhetorical arguments) and so does not necessarily describe a literal physical
    push, although it is possible that it did.\nFor instance, if Othismos were to
    accurately describe a physical pushing match, it would be logical to state that
    the deeper phalanx would always win an engagement since the physical strength
    of individuals would not compensate for even one additional rank on the enemy
    side. \n\nHowever, there are numerous examples of shallow phalanxes holding off
    an opponent. \n\nFor instance, at Delium in 424 BC, the Athenian left flank,
    a formation eight men deep, held off a formation of Thebans 25 deep without immediate
    collapse. \n\nIt is difficult with the physical pushing model to imagine eight
    men withstanding the pushing force of 25 opponents for a matter of seconds, let
    alone half the battle.\nSuch arguments have led to a wave of counter-criticism
    to physical shoving theorists. \n\nAdrian Goldsworthy, in his article \"The Othismos,
    Myths and Heresies: The nature of Hoplite Battle\", argues that the physical
    pushing match model does not fit with the average casualty figures of hoplite
    warfare nor the practical realities of moving large formations of men in battle.
    \n\nThis debate has yet to be resolved amongst scholars.\nPractical difficulties
    with this theory also include the fact that, in a shoving match, an eight-foot
    spear is too long to fight effectively or even parry attacks. \n\nSpears enable
    a formation of men to keep their enemies at a distance, parry attacks aimed at
    them and their comrades, and give the necessary reach to strike multiple men
    in the opposite formation. \n\nA pushing match would put enemies so close together
    that a quick stabbing with a knife would kill the front row almost instantly.
    \n\nThe crush of men would also prevent the formation from withdrawing or retreating,
    which would result in much higher casualties than is recorded. \n\nThe speed
    at which this would occur would also end the battle very quickly, instead of
    prolonging it for hours.\n\n\n=== Shields ===\n\nEach individual hoplite carried
    his shield on his left arm, protecting not only himself but also the soldier
    to the left. \n\nThis meant that the men at the extreme right of the phalanx
    were only half-protected. \n\nIn battle, opposing phalanxes would try to exploit
    this weakness by attempting to overlap the enemy's right flank. \n\nIt also meant
    that, in battle, a phalanx would tend to drift to the right (as hoplites sought
    to remain behind the shield of their neighbor). \n\nSome groups, such as the
    Spartans at Nemea, tried to use this phenomenon to their advantage. \n\nIn this
    case, the phalanx would sacrifice its left side, which typically consisted of
    allied troops, in an effort to overtake the enemy from the flank. \n\nIt is unlikely
    that this strategy worked very often, as it is not mentioned frequently in ancient
    Greek literature.There was a leader in each row of a phalanx, and a rear rank
    officer, the ouragos (meaning tail-leader), who kept order in the rear. \n\nThe
    hoplites had to trust their neighbors to protect them and in turn be willing
    to protect their neighbors; a phalanx was thus only as strong as its weakest
    elements. \n\nThe effectiveness of the phalanx therefore depended on how well
    the hoplites could maintain this formation in combat and how well they could
    stand their ground, especially when engaged against another phalanx. \n\nFor
    this reason, the formation was deliberately organized to group friends and family
    close together, thus providing a psychological incentive to support one's fellows,
    and a disincentive, through shame, to panic or attempt to flee. \n\nThe more
    disciplined and courageous the army, the more likely it was to win \u2013 often
    engagements between the various city-states of Greece would be resolved by one
    side fleeing before the battle. \n\nThe Greek word dynamis, the 'will to fight',
    expresses the drive that kept hoplites in formation.\n\nNow of those, who dare,
    abiding one beside another, to advance to the close fray, and the foremost champions,
    fewer die, and they save the people in the rear; but in men that fear, all excellence
    is lost. \n\nNo one could ever in words go through those several ills, which
    befall a man, if he has been actuated by cowardice. \n\nFor 'tis grievous to
    wound in the rear the back of a flying man in hostile war. \n\nShameful too is
    a corpse lying low in the dust, wounded behind in the back by the point of a
    spear.\n\n\n=== Hoplite armament ===\n\nEach hoplite provided his own equipment.
    \n\nThe primary hoplite weapon was a spear around 2.4 metres (7.9 ft) in length
    called a dory. \n\nAlthough accounts of its length vary, it is usually now believed
    to have been seven to nine feet long (~2.1\u20132.7 m). \n\nIt was held one-handed,
    with the other hand holding the hoplite's shield (aspis). \n\nThe spearhead was
    usually a curved leaf shape, while the rear of the spear had a spike called a
    sauroter ('lizard-killer') which was used to stand the spear in the ground (hence
    the name). \n\nIt was also used as a secondary weapon if the main shaft snapped
    or to kill enemies lying on the ground. \n\nThis was a common problem, especially
    for soldiers who were involved in the initial clash with the enemy. \n\nDespite
    the snapping of the spear, hoplites could easily switch to the sauroter without
    great consequence. \n\nThe rear ranks used the secondary end to finish off fallen
    opponents as the phalanx advanced over them.\nThroughout the hoplite era, the
    standard hoplite armour went through many cyclical changes. \n\nAn Archaic hoplite
    typically wore a bronze breastplate, a bronze helmet with cheekplates, as well
    as greaves and other armour. \n\nLater, in the classical period, the breastplate
    became less common, replaced instead with a corselet that some claim was made
    of linothorax (layers of linen glued together), or perhaps of leather, sometimes
    covered in whole or in part with overlapping metal scales. \n\nEventually, even
    greaves became less commonly used, although degrees of heavier armour remained,
    as attested by Xenophon as late as 401 BC.These changes reflected the balancing
    of mobility with protection, especially as cavalry became more prominent in the
    Peloponnesian War and the need to combat light troops, which were increasingly
    used to negate the hoplite's role as the primary force in battle. \n\nYet bronze
    armour remained in some form until the end of the hoplite era. \n\nSome archaeologists
    have pointed out that bronze armour does not actually provide as much protection
    from direct blows as more extensive corselet padding, and have suggested its
    continued use was a matter of status for those who could afford it. \n\nIn the
    classical Greek dialect, there is no word for swordsmen; yet hoplites also carried
    a short sword called the xiphos, used as a secondary weapon if the dory was broken
    or lost. \n\nSamples of the xiphos recovered at excavation sites were typically
    around 60 cm (24 in) in length. \n\nThese swords were double-edged and could
    therefore be used as a cutting and thrusting weapon. \n\nThese short swords were
    often used to stab or cut at the enemy's neck during close combat.Hoplites carried
    a circular shield called a hoplon (often referred to as an aspis) made from wood
    and covered in bronze, measuring roughly 1 metre (3.3 ft) in diameter. \n\nIt
    spanned from chin to knee and was very heavy (8\u201315 kg (18\u201333 lb)).
    \n\nThis medium-sized shield (fairly large for the period considering the average
    male height) was made possible partly by its dish-like shape, which allowed it
    to be supported with the rim on the shoulder. \n\nThis was quite an important
    feature of the shield, especially for the hoplites that remained in the latter
    ranks. \n\nWhile these soldiers continued to help press forward, they did not
    have the added burden of holding up their shield. \n\nBut the circular shield
    was not without its disadvantages. \n\nDespite its mobility, protective curve,
    and double straps the circular shape created gaps in the shield wall at both
    its top and bottom. (Top gaps were somewhat reduced by the one or two spears
    jutting out of the gap. \n\nIn order to minimize the bottom gaps, thick leather
    'curtains' were used but only by an [unknown] percentage of the hoplites, possibly
    mostly in the first row only since there were disadvantages as well: considerable
    added weight on an already heavy shield and a certain additional cost.) These
    gaps left parts of the hoplite exposed to potentially lethal spear thrusts and
    were a persistent vulnerability for hoplites controlling the front lines.\n\n\n===
    Phalangite armament ===\n\nThe phalanx of the Ancient Macedonian kingdom and
    the later Hellenistic successor states was a development of the hoplite phalanx.
    \n\nThe 'phalangites' were armed with a much longer spear, the sarissa, and less
    heavily armoured. \n\nThe sarissa was the pike used by the ancient Macedonian
    army. \n\nIts actual length is unknown, but apparently it was twice as long as
    the dory. \n\nThis makes it at least 14 feet (4.3 m), but 18 feet (5.5 m) appears
    more likely. (The cavalry xyston was 12.5 feet (3.8 m) by comparison.) The great
    length of the pike was balanced by a counterweight at the rear end, which also
    functioned as a butt-spike, allowing the sarissa to be planted into the ground.
    \n\nBecause of its great length, weight and different balance, a sarissa was
    wielded two-handed. \n\nThis meant that the aspis was no longer a practical defence.
    \n\nInstead, the phalangites strapped a smaller pelte shield (usually reserved
    for peltasts, light skirmishers) to their left forearm. \n\nRecent theories,
    including examination of ancient frescoes depicting full sets of weapons and
    armor, claim that the shields used were actually larger than the pelte but smaller
    than the aspis, hanging by leather strap(s) from the left shoulder or from both
    shoulders. \n\nThe shield would retain handling straps in the inner curve, to
    be handled like a (smaller) aspis if the fight progressed to sword-wielding.
    \n\nAlthough in both shield size assumptions this reduced the shield wall, the
    extreme length of the spear kept the enemy at a greater distance, as the pikes
    of the first three to five ranks could all be brought to bear in front of the
    front row. \n\nThis pike had to be held underhand, as the shield would have obscured
    the soldier's vision had it been held overhead. \n\nIt would also be very hard
    to remove a sarissa from anything it stuck in (the earth, shields, and soldiers
    of the opposition) if it were thrust downwards, due to its length. \n\nThe Macedonian
    phalanx was much less able to form a shield wall, but the lengthened spears would
    have compensated for this. \n\nSuch a phalanx formation also reduced the likelihood
    that battles would degenerate into a pushing match.\n\n\n== Deployment and combat
    ==\n\n=== Phalanx composition and strength ===\n\nThe basic combat element of
    the Greek armies was either the stichos (meaning 'file'; usually 8\u201316 men
    strong) or the enomotia (meaning 'sworn' and made up by 2\u20134 stich\u0153,
    totaling up to 32 men), both led by a dim\u0153rites who was assisted by a decadarchos
    and two decaster\u0153 (sing. decasteros). \n\nFour to a maximum of 32 enomoti\xE6
    (depending on the era in question or the city) were forming a lochos led by a
    lochagos, who in this way was in command of initially 100 hoplites to a maximum
    of c. 500 in the late Hellenistic armies. \n\nHere, it has to be noted that the
    military manuals of Asclepiodotus and Aelian use the term lochos to denote a
    file in the phalanx. \n\nA taxis (mora for the Spartans) was the greatest standard
    hoplitic formation of 500 to 1500 men, led by a strategos (general). \n\nThe
    entire army, a total of several taxeis or mor\xE6 was led by a generals' council.
    \n\nThe commander-in-chief was usually called a polemarchos or a strategos autocrator.\n\n\n===
    Phalanx front and depth ===\n\nHoplite phalanxes usually deployed in ranks of
    eight men or more deep; the Macedonian phalanxes were usually 16 men deep, sometimes
    reported to have been arrayed 32 men deep. \n\nThere are some notable extremes;
    at the battles of Leuctra and Mantinea, the Theban general Epaminondas arranged
    the left wing of the phalanx into a \"hammerhead\" of 50 ranks of elite hoplites
    deep (see below) and when depth was less important, phalanxes just four deep
    are recorded, as at the battle of Marathon.The phalanx depth could vary depending
    on the needs of the moment and plans of the general. \n\nWhile the phalanx was
    in march, an eis bathos formation (loose, meaning literally 'in depth') was adopted
    in order to move more freely and maintain order. \n\nThis was also the initial
    battle formation as, in addition, it permitted friendly units to pass through
    whether assaulting or retreating. \n\nIn this status, the phalanx had twice the
    normal depth and each hoplite had to occupy about 1.8\u20132 metres (5 ft 11
    in\u20136 ft 7 in) in width. \n\nWhen enemy infantry was approaching, a rapid
    switch to the pycne (spelled also pucne) formation (dense or tight formation)
    was necessary. \n\nIn that case, each man's space was halved (0.9\u20131 metre
    or 2 feet 11 inches\u20133 feet 3 inches in width) and the formation depth returned
    to normal. \n\nAn even denser formation, the synaspismos or sunaspismos (ultra-tight
    or locked shields formation), was used when the phalanx was expected to experience
    extra pressure, intense missile volleys or frontal cavalry charges. \n\nIn synaspismos,
    the rank depth was half that of a normal phalanx and the width each man occupied
    was as small as 0.45 metres (1.5 ft).\n\n\n=== Stages of combat ===\n\nSeveral
    stages in hoplite combat can be defined:\nEphodos: The hoplites stop singing
    their p\xE6anes (battle hymns) and move towards the enemy, gradually picking
    up pace and momentum. \n\nIn the instants before impact, war cries (alalagm\u0153,
    sing. alalagmos) would be made. \n\nNotable war cries were the Athenian (eleleleleu!
    eleleleleu!) and the Macedonian (alalalalai! alalalalai!) alalagm\u0153.\nKrousis:
    The opposing phalanxes meet each other almost simultaneously along their front.
    \nDoratismos: Repeated, rapid spear thrusts in order to disrupt the enemy formation.
    \n\nThe use of long spears would keep enemies apart as well as allow men in a
    row to assist their comrades next to them. \n\nThe prodding could also open up
    a man to allow a comrade to spear him. \n\nToo hard prodding could get a spear
    stuck in a shield, which would necessitate someone in the back to lend his to
    the now-disarmed man.\nOthismos: Literally 'pushing' after most spears have been
    broken, the hoplites begin to push with their spears and spear shafts against
    their opponents' shields. \n\nThis could be the longest phase.Pararrhexis: 'Breaching'
    the opposing phalanx, the enemy formation shatters and the battle ends. \n\nCavalry
    would be used at this point to mop up the scattered enemy.\n\n\n== Tactics ==\n\nThe
    early history of the phalanx is largely one of combat between hoplite armies
    from competing Greek city-states. \n\nThe usual result was rather identical,
    inflexible formations pushing against each other until one broke. \n\nThe potential
    of the phalanx to achieve something more was demonstrated at Battle of Marathon
    (490 BC). \n\nFacing the much larger army of Darius I, the Athenians thinned
    out their phalanx and consequently lengthened their front, to avoid being outflanked.
    \n\nHowever, even a reduced-depth phalanx proved unstoppable to the lightly armed
    Persian infantry. \n\nAfter routing the Persian wings, the hoplites on the Athenian
    wings wheeled inwards, destroying the elite troop at the Persian centre, resulting
    in a crushing victory for Athens. \n\nThroughout the Greco-Persian Wars the hoplite
    phalanx was to prove superior to the Persian infantry (e.g. the battles of Thermopylae
    and Plataea).\nPerhaps the most prominent example of the phalanx's evolution
    was the oblique order, made famous in the Battle of Leuctra. \n\nThere, the Theban
    general Epaminondas thinned out the right flank and centre of his phalanx, and
    deepened his left flank to an unheard-of 50 men deep. \n\nIn doing so, Epaminondas
    reversed the convention by which the right flank of the phalanx was strongest.
    \n\nThis allowed the Thebans to assault in strength the elite Spartan troops
    on the right flank of the opposing phalanx. \n\nMeanwhile, the centre and right
    flank of the Theban line were echeloned back, from the opposing phalanx, keeping
    the weakened parts of the formation from being engaged. \n\nOnce the Spartan
    right had been routed by the Theban left, the remainder of the Spartan line also
    broke. \n\nThus, by localising the attacking power of the hoplites, Epaminondas
    was able to defeat an enemy previously thought invincible.\nPhilip II of Macedon
    spent several years in Thebes as a hostage, and paid attention to Epaminondas'
    innovations. \n\nOn return to his homeland, he raised a revolutionary new infantry
    force, which was to change the face of the Greek world. \n\nPhilip's phalangites
    were the first force of professional soldiers seen in Ancient Greece apart from
    Sparta. \n\nThey were armed with longer spears (the sarissa) and were drilled
    more thoroughly in more evolved, complicated tactics and manoeuvres. \n\nMore
    importantly, though, Philip's phalanx was part of a multi-faceted, combined force
    that included a variety of skirmishers and cavalry, most notably the famous Companion
    cavalry. \n\nThe Macedonian phalanx now was used to pin the centre of the enemy
    line, while cavalry and more mobile infantry struck at the foe's flanks. \n\nIts
    supremacy over the more static armies fielded by the Greek city-states was shown
    at the Battle of Chaeronea, where Philip II's army crushed the allied Theban
    and Athenian phalanxes.\n\n\n== Weaknesses ==\n\nThe hoplite phalanx was weakest
    when facing an enemy fielding lighter and more flexible troops without its own
    such supporting troops. \n\nAn example of this would be the Battle of Lechaeum,
    where an Athenian contingent led by Iphicrates routed an entire Spartan mora
    (a unit of anywhere from 500 to 900 hoplites). \n\nThe Athenian force had a considerable
    proportion of light missile troops armed with javelins and bows that wore down
    the Spartans with repeated attacks, causing disarray in the Spartan ranks and
    an eventual rout when they spotted Athenian heavy infantry reinforcements trying
    to flank them by boat.\nThe Macedonian phalanx had weaknesses similar to its
    hoplitic predecessor. \n\nTheoretically indestructible from the front, its flanks
    and rear were very vulnerable, and once engaged it may not easily disengage or
    redeploy to face a threat from those directions. \n\nThus, a phalanx facing non-phalangite
    formations required some sort of protection on its flanks\u2014lighter or at
    least more mobile infantry, cavalry, etc. \n\nThis was shown at the Battle of
    Magnesia, where, once the Seleucid supporting cavalry elements were driven off,
    the phalanx was static and unable to go on the offensive against its Roman opponents
    (although they continued to resist stoutly and attempted a fighting withdrawal
    under a hail of Roman missiles, until the elephants posted on their flanks panicked
    and disrupted their formation).\nThe Macedonian phalanx could also lose its cohesion
    without proper coordination or while moving through broken terrain; doing so
    could create gaps between individual blocks/syntagmata, or could prevent a solid
    front within those sub-units as well, causing other sections of the line to bunch
    up. \n\nIn this event, as in the battles of Cynoscephalae and Pydna, the phalanx
    became vulnerable to attacks by more flexible units\u2014such as Roman legionary
    centuries, which were able to avoid the sarissae and engage in hand-to-hand combat
    with the phalangites.\nAnother important area that must be considered concerns
    the psychological tendencies of the hoplites. \n\nBecause the strength of a phalanx
    depended on the ability of the hoplites to maintain their frontline, it was crucial
    that a phalanx be able to quickly and efficiently replace fallen soldiers in
    the front ranks. \n\nIf a phalanx failed to do this in a structured manner, the
    opposing phalanx would have an opportunity to breach the line which, many times,
    would lead to a quick defeat. \n\nThis then implies that the hoplites ranks closer
    to the front must be mentally prepared to replace their fallen comrade and adapt
    to his new position without disrupting the structure of the frontline.Finally,
    most of the phalanx-centric armies tended to lack supporting echelons behind
    the main line of battle. \n\nThis meant that breaking through the line of battle
    or compromising one of its flanks often ensured victory.\n\n\n== Classical decline
    and post-classical use ==\n\nAfter reaching its zenith in the conquests of Alexander
    the Great, the phalanx began a slow decline, as Macedonian successor states declined.
    \n\nThe combined arms tactics used by Alexander and his father were gradually
    replaced by a return to the simpler frontal charge tactics of the hoplite phalanx.
    \n\nThe expense of the supporting arms and cavalry, and the widespread use of
    mercenaries, caused the Diadochi to rely on phalanx vs. phalanx tactics during
    the Wars of the Diadochi.\nThe decline of the Diadochi and the phalanx was linked
    with the rise of Rome and the Roman legions from the 3rd century BC. \n\nThe
    Battle of the Caudine Forks showed the clumsiness of the Roman phalanx against
    the Samnites. \n\nThe Romans had originally employed the phalanx themselves but
    gradually evolved more flexible tactics. \n\nThe result was the three-line Roman
    legion of the middle period of the Roman Republic, the Manipular System. \n\nRomans
    used a phalanx for their third military line, the triarii. \n\nThese were veteran
    reserve troops armed with the hastae or spear. \n\nRome conquered most of the
    Macedonian successor states. \n\nAlso the various Greek city-states and leagues.
    \n\nAs these states ceased to exist, so did the armies which used the traditional
    phalanx. \n\nSubsequently, troops from these regions were equipped, trained and
    fought using the Roman model.\nA phalanx formation called the phoulkon appeared
    in the late Roman army and Byzantine army. \n\nIt had characteristics of the
    classical Greek and Hellenistic phalanxes, but was more flexible. \n\nIt was
    used against cavalry more than infantry.\nHowever, the phalanx did not totally
    disappear. \n\nIn some battles between the Roman army and Hellenistic phalanxes,
    such as Pydna (168 BC), Cynoscephalae (197 BC) and Magnesia (190 BC), the phalanx
    performed well. \n\nIt even drove back the Roman infantry. \n\nHowever, at Cynoscephalae
    and Magnesia, failure to defend the flanks of the phalanx led to defeat. \n\nAt
    Pydna, the phalanx lost cohesion when pursuing retreating Roman soldiers. \n\nThis
    allowed the Romans to penetrate the formation. \n\nThen, Roman close combat skills
    proved decisive. \n\nThe historian Polybius details the effectiveness of the
    Roman legion against the phalanx. \n\nHe deduces that the Romans refused to fight
    the phalanx where the phalanx was effective, Romans offered battle only when
    a legion could exploit the clumsiness and immobility of a phalanx.\n\nSpear-armed
    troops continued to be important elements in many armies until reliable firearms
    became available. \n\nThese did not necessarily fight as a phalanx. \n\nFor example,
    compare the classical phalanx and late medieval pike formations.Military historians
    have suggested that the Scots under William Wallace and Robert the Bruce consciously
    imitated the Hellenistic phalanx to produce the Scots 'hedgehog' or schiltron.
    \n\nHowever, long spears might have been used by Picts and others in Scotlands'
    Early Middle Ages. \n\nPrior to 1066, long spear tactics (also found in North
    Wales) might have been part of irregular warfare in Britain. \n\nThe Scots used
    imported French pikes and dynamic tactics at the Battle of Flodden. \n\nHowever,
    Flodden found the Scots pitted against effective light artillery, while advancing
    over bad ground. \n\nThe combination disorganised the Scotts phalanxes and permitted
    effective attacks by English longbowmen, and soldiers wielding shorter, handier
    polearms called bills. \n\nSome contemporary sources might say that the bills
    cut off the heads of Scots pikes.\nThe pike was briefly reconsidered as a weapon
    by European armies in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. \n\nIt could protect
    riflemen, whose slower rate of fire made them vulnerable. \n\nA collapsible pike
    was invented but never issued. \n\nThe Confederate Army considered these for
    the American Civil War. \n\nSome were even manufactured but probably were never
    issued. \n\nPikes were manufactured during World War II as \"Croft's Pikes\".\nWhile
    obsolete in military practice, the phalanx remained in use as a metaphor of warriors
    moving forward as a single united block. \n\nThis metaphor inspired several 20th-century
    political movements, notably the Spanish Falange and its ideology of Falangism.\nThe
    Byzantines continued and improved the use of the classical Greek phalanx alongside
    the Macedonian-style phalanx. \n\nThe latter was based on a model that Alexander
    himself had created and had tried to give more importance to the skirmishers
    and cavalry, yet it never saw action until the Byzantines adopted the model that
    rely in a mixture of many units sometimes. \n\nMany writers of the age describe
    the spear as being a sarissa yet it was a meter short than the original sarissa
    and had being modified by the time, yet the term for the long spear remained
    alongside with its other names.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phalanx"

  descriptionText: "\n\nPATELLA\n\n\nThe patella, also known as the kneecap, is a
    flat, rounded triangular bone which articulates with the femur (thigh bone) and
    covers and protects the anterior articular surface of the knee joint. \n\nThe
    patella is found in many tetrapods, such as mice, cats, birds and dogs, but not
    in whales, or most reptiles.\nIn humans, the patella is the largest sesamoid
    bone in the body. \n\nBabies are born with a patella of soft cartilage which
    begins to ossify into bone at about four years of age.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe
    patella is a sesamoid bone roughly triangular in shape, with the apex of the
    patella facing downwards. \n\nThe apex is the most inferior (lowest) part of
    the patella. \n\nIt is pointed in shape, and gives attachment to the patellar
    ligament.\nThe front and back surfaces are joined by a thin margin and towards
    centre by a thicker margin. \n\nThe tendon of the quadriceps femoris muscle attaches
    to the base of the patella., with the vastus intermedius muscle attaching to
    the base itself, and the vastus lateralis and vastus medialis are attached to
    outer lateral and medial borders of patella respectively.\nThe upper third of
    the front of the patella is coarse, flattened, and rough, and serves for the
    attachment of the tendon of the quadriceps and often has exostoses. \n\nThe middle
    third has numerous vascular canaliculi. \n\nThe lower third culminates in the
    apex which serves as the origin of the patellar ligament. \n\nThe posterior surface
    is divided into two parts.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\nThe upper three-quarters of the patella
    articulates with the femur and is subdivided into a medial and a lateral facet
    by a vertical ledge which varies in shape.\nIn the adult the articular surface
    is about 12 cm2 (1.9 sq in) and covered by cartilage, which can reach a maximal
    thickness of 6 mm (0.24 in) in the centre at about 30 years of age. \n\nOwing
    to the great stress on the patellofemoral joint during resisted knee flexion,
    the articular cartilage of the patella is among the thickest in the human body.\nThe
    lower part of the posterior surface has vascular canaliculi filled and is filled
    by fatty tissue, the infrapatellar fat pad.\n\n\n=== Variation ===\n\n\nEmarginations
    (i.e. patella emarginata, a \"missing piece\") are common laterally on the proximal
    edge. \n\nBipartite patellas are the result of an ossification of a second cartilaginous
    layer at the location of an emargination. \n\nPreviously, bipartite patellas
    were explained as the failure of several ossification centres to fuse, but this
    idea has been rejected. \n\nPartite patellas occur almost exclusively in men.
    \n\nTripartite and even multipartite patellas occur.\nThe upper three-quarters
    of the patella articulates with the femur and is subdivided into a medial and
    a lateral facet by a vertical ledge which varies in shape. \n\nFour main types
    of articular surface can be distinguished:\n\nMost commonly the medial articular
    surface is smaller than the lateral.\nSometimes both articular surfaces are virtually
    equal in size.\nOccasionally, the medial surface is hypoplastic or\nthe central
    ledge is only indicated.\n\n\n=== Development ===\n\nIn the patella an ossification
    centre develops at the age of 3\u20136 years. \n\nThe patella originates from
    two centres of ossification which unite when fully formed.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\nThe
    primary functional role of the patella is knee extension. \n\nThe patella increases
    the leverage that the quadriceps tendon can exert on the femur by increasing
    the angle at which it acts.\nThe patella is attached to the tendon of the quadriceps
    femoris muscle, which contracts to extend/straighten the knee. \n\nThe patella
    is stabilized by the insertion of the horizontal fibres of vastus medialis and
    by the prominence of the lateral femoral condyle, which discourages lateral dislocation
    during flexion. \n\nThe retinacular fibres of the patella also stabilize it during
    exercise.\n\n\n== Clinical significance ==\n\n\n\n=== Dislocation ===\n\n\nPatellar
    dislocations occur with significant regularity, particularly in young female
    athletes. \n\nIt involves the patella sliding out of its position on the knee,
    most often laterally, and may be associated with extremely intense pain and swelling.
    \n\nThe patella can be tracked back into the groove with an extension of the
    knee, and therefore sometimes returns into the proper position on its own.\n\n\n===
    Vertical alignment ===\n\n\nA patella alta is a high-riding (superiorly aligned)
    patella. \n\nAn attenuated patella alta is an unusually small patella that develops
    out of and above the joint.\nA patella baja is a low-riding patella. \n\nA long-standing
    patella baja may result in extensor dysfunction.\n\nThe Insall-Salvati ratio
    helps to indicate patella baja on lateral X-rays, and is calculated as the patellar
    tendon length divided by the patellar bone length. \n\nAn Insall-Salvati ratio
    of < 0.8 indicates patella baja.\n\n\n=== Fracture ===\n\n\nThe kneecap is prone
    to injury because of its particularly exposed location, and fractures of the
    patella commonly occur as a consequence of direct trauma onto the knee. \n\nThese
    fractures usually cause swelling and pain in the region, bleeding into the joint
    (hemarthrosis), and an inability to extend the knee. \n\nPatella fractures are
    usually treated with surgery, unless the damage is minimal and the extensor mechanism
    is intact.\n\n\n=== Exostosis ===\n\nAn exostosis is the formation of new bone
    onto a bone, as a result of excess calcium formation. \n\nThis can be the cause
    of chronic pain when formed on the patella.\n\n\n== In animals ==\n\nThe patella
    is found in placental mammals and birds; most marsupials have only rudimentary,
    non-ossified patellae although a few species possess a bony patella. \n\nA patella
    is also present in the living monotremes, the platypus and the echidna. \n\nIn
    more primitive tetrapods, including living amphibians and most reptiles (except
    some Lepidosaurs), the muscle tendons from the upper leg are attached directly
    to the tibia, and a patella is not present. \n\nIn 2017 it was discovered that
    frogs have kneecaps, contrary to what was thought. \n\nThis raises the possibility
    that the kneecap arose 400 million years ago when tetrapods first appeared, but
    that it disappeared in some animals.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe word patella
    originated in the late 17th century from the diminutive form of Latin patina
    or patena or paten, meaning shallow dish.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patella"

  descriptionText: "\n\nPATELLA\n\n\nThe patella, also known as the kneecap, is a
    flat, rounded triangular bone which articulates with the femur (thigh bone) and
    covers and protects the anterior articular surface of the knee joint. \n\nThe
    patella is found in many tetrapods, such as mice, cats, birds and dogs, but not
    in whales, or most reptiles.\nIn humans, the patella is the largest sesamoid
    bone in the body. \n\nBabies are born with a patella of soft cartilage which
    begins to ossify into bone at about four years of age.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe
    patella is a sesamoid bone roughly triangular in shape, with the apex of the
    patella facing downwards. \n\nThe apex is the most inferior (lowest) part of
    the patella. \n\nIt is pointed in shape, and gives attachment to the patellar
    ligament.\nThe front and back surfaces are joined by a thin margin and towards
    centre by a thicker margin. \n\nThe tendon of the quadriceps femoris muscle attaches
    to the base of the patella., with the vastus intermedius muscle attaching to
    the base itself, and the vastus lateralis and vastus medialis are attached to
    outer lateral and medial borders of patella respectively.\nThe upper third of
    the front of the patella is coarse, flattened, and rough, and serves for the
    attachment of the tendon of the quadriceps and often has exostoses. \n\nThe middle
    third has numerous vascular canaliculi. \n\nThe lower third culminates in the
    apex which serves as the origin of the patellar ligament. \n\nThe posterior surface
    is divided into two parts.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\nThe upper three-quarters of the patella
    articulates with the femur and is subdivided into a medial and a lateral facet
    by a vertical ledge which varies in shape.\nIn the adult the articular surface
    is about 12 cm2 (1.9 sq in) and covered by cartilage, which can reach a maximal
    thickness of 6 mm (0.24 in) in the centre at about 30 years of age. \n\nOwing
    to the great stress on the patellofemoral joint during resisted knee flexion,
    the articular cartilage of the patella is among the thickest in the human body.\nThe
    lower part of the posterior surface has vascular canaliculi filled and is filled
    by fatty tissue, the infrapatellar fat pad.\n\n\n=== Variation ===\n\n\nEmarginations
    (i.e. patella emarginata, a \"missing piece\") are common laterally on the proximal
    edge. \n\nBipartite patellas are the result of an ossification of a second cartilaginous
    layer at the location of an emargination. \n\nPreviously, bipartite patellas
    were explained as the failure of several ossification centres to fuse, but this
    idea has been rejected. \n\nPartite patellas occur almost exclusively in men.
    \n\nTripartite and even multipartite patellas occur.\nThe upper three-quarters
    of the patella articulates with the femur and is subdivided into a medial and
    a lateral facet by a vertical ledge which varies in shape. \n\nFour main types
    of articular surface can be distinguished:\n\nMost commonly the medial articular
    surface is smaller than the lateral.\nSometimes both articular surfaces are virtually
    equal in size.\nOccasionally, the medial surface is hypoplastic or\nthe central
    ledge is only indicated.\n\n\n=== Development ===\n\nIn the patella an ossification
    centre develops at the age of 3\u20136 years. \n\nThe patella originates from
    two centres of ossification which unite when fully formed.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\nThe
    primary functional role of the patella is knee extension. \n\nThe patella increases
    the leverage that the quadriceps tendon can exert on the femur by increasing
    the angle at which it acts.\nThe patella is attached to the tendon of the quadriceps
    femoris muscle, which contracts to extend/straighten the knee. \n\nThe patella
    is stabilized by the insertion of the horizontal fibres of vastus medialis and
    by the prominence of the lateral femoral condyle, which discourages lateral dislocation
    during flexion. \n\nThe retinacular fibres of the patella also stabilize it during
    exercise.\n\n\n== Clinical significance ==\n\n\n\n=== Dislocation ===\n\n\nPatellar
    dislocations occur with significant regularity, particularly in young female
    athletes. \n\nIt involves the patella sliding out of its position on the knee,
    most often laterally, and may be associated with extremely intense pain and swelling.
    \n\nThe patella can be tracked back into the groove with an extension of the
    knee, and therefore sometimes returns into the proper position on its own.\n\n\n===
    Vertical alignment ===\n\n\nA patella alta is a high-riding (superiorly aligned)
    patella. \n\nAn attenuated patella alta is an unusually small patella that develops
    out of and above the joint.\nA patella baja is a low-riding patella. \n\nA long-standing
    patella baja may result in extensor dysfunction.\n\nThe Insall-Salvati ratio
    helps to indicate patella baja on lateral X-rays, and is calculated as the patellar
    tendon length divided by the patellar bone length. \n\nAn Insall-Salvati ratio
    of < 0.8 indicates patella baja.\n\n\n=== Fracture ===\n\n\nThe kneecap is prone
    to injury because of its particularly exposed location, and fractures of the
    patella commonly occur as a consequence of direct trauma onto the knee. \n\nThese
    fractures usually cause swelling and pain in the region, bleeding into the joint
    (hemarthrosis), and an inability to extend the knee. \n\nPatella fractures are
    usually treated with surgery, unless the damage is minimal and the extensor mechanism
    is intact.\n\n\n=== Exostosis ===\n\nAn exostosis is the formation of new bone
    onto a bone, as a result of excess calcium formation. \n\nThis can be the cause
    of chronic pain when formed on the patella.\n\n\n== In animals ==\n\nThe patella
    is found in placental mammals and birds; most marsupials have only rudimentary,
    non-ossified patellae although a few species possess a bony patella. \n\nA patella
    is also present in the living monotremes, the platypus and the echidna. \n\nIn
    more primitive tetrapods, including living amphibians and most reptiles (except
    some Lepidosaurs), the muscle tendons from the upper leg are attached directly
    to the tibia, and a patella is not present. \n\nIn 2017 it was discovered that
    frogs have kneecaps, contrary to what was thought. \n\nThis raises the possibility
    that the kneecap arose 400 million years ago when tetrapods first appeared, but
    that it disappeared in some animals.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe word patella
    originated in the late 17th century from the diminutive form of Latin patina
    or patena or paten, meaning shallow dish.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patella"

    MANUBRIUM (OF STERNUM)



    The manubrium (Latin for
    "handle") is the broad upper part of the sternum.


    It has a quadrangular
    shape, narrowing from the top, which gives it four borders.


    The suprasternal
    notch (jugular notch) is located in the middle at the upper broadest part of
    the manubrium.


    This notch can be felt between the two clavicles.


    On
    either side of this notch are the right and left clavicular notches.The manubrium
    joins with the body of the sternum, the clavicles and the cartilages of the first
    pair of ribs.


    The inferior border, oval and rough, is covered with a thin
    layer of cartilage for articulation with the body.


    The lateral borders
    are each marked above by a depression for the first costal cartilage, and below
    by a small facet, which, with a similar facet on the upper angle of the body,
    forms a notch for the reception of the costal cartilage of the second rib.


    Between
    the depression for the first costal cartilage and the demi-facet for the second
    is a narrow, curved edge, which slopes from above downward towards the middle.


    Also,
    the superior sternopericardial ligament attaches the pericardium to the posterior
    side of the manubrium.

  descriptionText: "\n\nSIXTH RIB\n\n\n== Structure of the rib cage ==\n\nRibs are
    described based on their location and connection with the sternum. \n\nAll ribs
    are attached posteriorly to the thoracic vertebrae and are numbered accordingly
    one to twelve. \n\nRibs that articulate directly with the sternum are called
    true ribs, whereas those that do not articulate directly are termed false ribs.
    \n\n\n=== Attachment of the rib cage ===\n\nThe terms true ribs and false ribs
    describe rib pairs that are directly or indirectly attached to the sternum. \n\nThe
    first seven rib pairs known as the fixed or vertebrosternal ribs are the true
    ribs (Latin: costae verae) as they connect directly to the sternum; the next
    five pairs (eighth to twelfth) are the false ribs (Latin: costae spuriae). \n\n\n===
    Parts of rib (general) ===\n\nEach rib consists of a head, neck, and a shaft.
    \n\nAll ribs are attached posteriorly to the thoracic vertebrae. \n\nThey are
    numbered to match the vertebrae they attach to \u2013 one to twelve, from top
    (T1) to bottom. \n\nThe head of the rib is the end part closest to the vertebra
    with which it articulates. \n\nIt is marked by a kidney-shaped articular surface
    which is divided by a horizontal crest into two articulating regions. \n\nThe
    upper region articulates with the inferior costal facet on the vertebra above,
    and the larger region articulates with the superior costal facet on the vertebra
    with the same number. \n\nThe transverse process of a thoracic vertebra also
    articulates at the transverse costal facet with the tubercle of the rib of the
    same number. \n\nThe crest gives attachment to the intra-articular ligament.The
    neck of the rib is the flattened part that extends laterally from the head. \n\nThe
    neck is about 3 cm long. \n\nIts anterior surface is flat and smooth, whilst
    its posterior is perforated by numerous foramina and its surface rough, to give
    attachment to the ligament of the neck. \n\nIts upper border presents a rough
    crest (crista colli costae) for the attachment of the anterior costotransverse
    ligament; its lower border is rounded.\n\nOn the posterior surface at the neck,
    is an eminence\u2014the tubercle that consists of an articular and a non-articular
    portion. \n\nThe articular portion is the lower and more medial of the two and
    presents a small, oval surface for articulation with the transverse costal facet
    on the end of the transverse process of the lower of the two vertebrae to which
    the head is connected. \n\nThe non-articular portion is a rough elevation and
    affords attachment to the ligament of the tubercle. \n\nThe tubercle is much
    more prominent in the upper ribs than in the lower ribs.\n\nThe angle of a rib
    (costal angle) may both refer to the bending part of it, and a prominent line
    in this area, a little in front of the tubercle. \n\nThis line is directed downward
    and laterally; this gives attachment to a tendon of the iliocostalis muscle.
    \n\nAt this point, the rib is bent in two directions, and at the same time twisted
    on its long axis.\n\nThe distance between the angle and the tubercle is progressively
    greater from the second to the tenth ribs. \n\nThe area between the angle and
    the tubercle is rounded, rough, and irregular, and serves for the attachment
    of the longissimus dorsi muscle.\n\n\n==== Ribs and vertebrae ====\n\nThe first
    rib (the topmost one) is the most curved and usually the shortest of all the
    ribs; it is broad and flat, its surfaces looking upward and downward, and its
    borders inward and outward.\n        \nThe head is small and rounded, and possesses
    only a single articular facet, for articulation with the body of the first thoracic
    vertebra. \n\nThe neck is narrow and rounded. \n\nThe tubercle, thick and prominent,
    is placed on the outer border. \n\nIt bears a small facet for articulation with
    the transverse costal facet on the transverse process of T1. \n\nThere is no
    angle, but at the tubercle, the rib is slightly bent, with the convexity upward,
    so that the head of the bone is directed downward. \n\nThe upper surface of the
    body is marked by two shallow grooves, separated from each other by a slight
    ridge prolonged internally into a tubercle, the scalene tubercle, for the attachment
    of the anterior scalene; the anterior groove transmits the subclavian vein, the
    posterior the subclavian artery and the lowest trunk of the brachial plexus.
    \n\nBehind the posterior groove is a rough area for the attachment of the medial
    scalene. \n\nThe under surface is smooth and without a costal groove. \n\nThe
    outer border is convex, thick, and rounded, and at its posterior part gives attachment
    to the first digitation of the serratus anterior. \n\nThe inner border is concave,
    thin, and sharp, and marked about its center by the scalene tubercle. \n\nThe
    anterior extremity is larger and thicker than that of any of the other ribs.\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rib_cage"

    INTERMEDIATE CUNEIFORM BONE



    There are three cuneiform
    ("wedge-shaped") bones in the human foot:


    -the first or medial cuneiform

    -the
    second or intermediate cuneiform, also known as the middle cuneiform

    -the
    third or lateral cuneiformThey are located between the navicular bone and the
    first, second and third metatarsal bones and are medial to the cuboid bone.



    ==
    Structure ==


    The intermediate cuneiform is situated between the other two
    cuneiform bones (the medial and lateral cuneiforms), and articulates with the
    navicular posteriorly, the second metatarsal anteriorly and with the other cuneiforms
    on either side.

  descriptionText: "\n\nCANINE TOOTH\n\n\nIn mammalian oral anatomy, the canine teeth,
    also called cuspids, dog teeth, or (in the context of the upper jaw) fangs, eye
    teeth, vampire teeth, or vampire fangs, are the relatively long, pointed teeth.
    \n\nThey can appear more flattened however, causing them to resemble incisors
    and leading them to be called incisiform. \n\nThey developed and are used primarily
    for firmly holding food in order to tear it apart, and occasionally as weapons.
    \n\nThey are often the largest teeth in a mammal's mouth. \n\nIndividuals of
    most species that develop them normally have four, two in the upper jaw and two
    in the lower, separated within each jaw by incisors; humans and dogs are examples.
    \n\nIn most species, canines are the anterior-most teeth in the maxillary bone.
    \nThe four canines in humans are the two maxillary canines and the two mandibular
    canines.\n\n\n== Details ==\n\nThere are four canine teeth: two in the upper
    (maxillary) and two in the lower (mandibular) arch. \n\nA canine is placed laterally
    to each lateral incisor and mesial to the premolars. \n\nThey are larger and
    stronger than the incisors, and their roots sink deeply into the bones, and cause
    well-marked prominences upon the surface. \n\nThey are the only teeth in dentition
    with a single cusp, their crowns are roughly triangular from mesial view and
    trapezoidal in buccal view.\n\nThe crown is large and conical, very convex on
    its labial surface, a little hollowed and uneven on its lingual surface, and
    tapering to a blunted point or cusp, which projects beyond the level of the other
    teeth. \n\nThe root is single, but longer and thicker than that of the incisors,
    conical in form, compressed laterally, and marked by a slight groove on each
    side. \n\nThe lingual surface also presents two depressions on either side of
    the surface separated by a ridge in between; these depressions are known as mesial
    and distal lingual fossae.\n\n\n=== Eruption ===\n\nIn humans, the upper canine
    teeth (popularly called eye teeth, from their position under the eyes) are larger
    and longer than the lower, and usually present a distinct basal ridge. \n\nEruption
    typically occurs between the ages of eleven and twelve years for upper canines
    and between nine and ten years for lower canines. \n\nUpper deciduous canines
    also known as the baby tooth, typically erupt between ages of sixteen and twenty-two
    months and sheds between ten and twelve years. \n\nLower deciduous canines typically
    erupt between ages of seventeen and twenty-two months and sheds between nine
    to twelve years \n\n\n=== Developmental defects ===\n\nTransposition (positional
    interchange of two adjacent teeth) is a development defect that most commonly
    found in the permanent canine, with the maxillary being more commonly seen than
    mandibular. \n\nThe upper canine frequently transposed with the first premolar
    whilst the lower canine transposed with the lateral incisor. \n\nOccasionally
    canines are congenitally missing.\n\n\n=== Maxillary canine morphology ===\n\nFrom
    a facial aspect, maxillary canines are approximately one millimetre narrower
    than the central incisor. \n\nTheir mesial aspects resemble the adjacent lateral
    incisors, while their distal aspects anticipate the first premolars. \n\nThey
    are slightly darker and more yellow in color than the other anterior teeth. \n\nFrom
    a lingual aspect, they have well developed mesial and distal marginal ridges
    and a well-developed cingulum. \n\nA prominent lingual ridge divides the lingual
    aspect in half and creates the mesial and distal lingual fossae between the lingual
    ridge and the marginal ridges. \n\nFrom a proximal aspect, they resemble the
    incisors, but are more robust, especially in the cingulum region. \n\nIncisally,
    they are visibly asymmetrical, as the mesial incisal edge is slightly shorter
    than the distal incisal edge, which places the cusp slightly mesial to the long
    axis of the tooth. \n\nThey are also thicker labiolingually than mesiodistally.
    \n\nBecause of the disproportionate incisal edges, the contacts are also asymmetrical.
    \n\nMesially, the contact sits at the junction of the incisal and middle third
    of the crown, while distally, the contact as more cervical, in the middle of
    the middle third of the crown.The root of the maxillary canines are the longest
    root of any tooth and conical in shape.\n\n\n=== Mandibular canine morphology
    ===\n\nThe lower canine teeth are placed nearer the middle line than the upper,
    so that their summits correspond to the intervals between the upper canines and
    the lateral incisors. \n\nFrom a facial aspect, the mandibular canine is notably
    narrower mesiodistally than the maxillary one, the root is compressed mesiodistally
    with well-marked grooves on both sides and may be just as long as the maxillary
    (and at times bifurcated). \n\nA distinctive feature is the nearly straight outline
    this tooth has compared to the maxillary canine which is slightly more bowed.
    \n\nAs in the maxillary canine, the mesial incisal edge (or cusp ridge) is shorter
    than the distal side, however, the cusp is displaced slightly lingual relative
    to the cusp of the maxillary canine.\n\nLingually, the surface of the tooth is
    much smoother compared to the very pronounced surface of the maxillary canine,
    and the cingulum is noted as less developed. \n\nThe cusp may be lost with attrition
    over time and may resemble an upper second permanent incisor.\n\n\n== Sexual
    dimorphism ==\n\nWith many species, the canine teeth in the upper or lower jaw,
    or in both, are much larger in the males than in the females, or are absent in
    females, except sometimes a hidden rudiment. \n\nCertain antelopes, the musk-deer,
    camel, horse, boar, various apes, seals, and the walrus, offer instances.\n\n\n==
    In non-synapsids ==\n\nIn non-synapsids (\"mammal-like reptiles\"), teeth similar
    to canines may be termed \"caniniform\" (\"canine-shaped\") teeth.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canine_tooth"

  descriptionText: "\n\nPHALANX\n\n\nThe phalanx (Ancient Greek: \u03C6\u03AC\u03BB\u03B1\u03B3\u03BE;
    plural phalanxes or phalanges, \u03C6\u03AC\u03BB\u03B1\u03B3\u03B3\u03B5\u03C2,
    phalanges) was a rectangular mass military formation, usually composed entirely
    of heavy infantry armed with spears, pikes, sarissas, or similar pole weapons.
    \n\nThe term is particularly used to describe the use of this formation in Ancient
    Greek warfare, although the ancient Greek writers used it to also describe any
    massed infantry formation, regardless of its equipment. \n\nArrian uses the term
    in his Array against the Alans when he refers to his legions. \n\nIn Greek texts,
    the phalanx may be deployed for battle, on the march, or even camped, thus describing
    the mass of infantry or cavalry that would deploy in line during battle. \n\nThey
    marched forward as one entity. \nThe term itself, as used today, does not refer
    to a distinctive military unit or division (e.g., the Roman legion or the contemporary
    Western-type battalion), but to the type of formation of an army's troops. \n\nTherefore,
    this term does not indicate a standard combat strength or composition but includes
    the total number of infantry, which is deployed in a single formation known as
    a \"phalanx\".\nMany spear-armed troops historically fought in what might be
    termed phalanx-like formations. \n\nThis article focuses on the use of the military
    phalanx formation in Ancient Greece, the Hellenistic world, and other ancient
    states heavily influenced by Greek civilization.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe earliest
    known depiction of a phalanx-like formation occurs in a Sumerian stele from the
    25th century BC. \n\nHere the troops seem to have been equipped with spears,
    helmets, and large shields covering the whole body. \n\nAncient Egyptian infantry
    were known to have employed similar formations. \n\nThe first usage of the term
    phalanx comes from Homer's \"\u03C6\u03B1\u03BB\u03B1\u03B3\u03BE\", used to
    describe hoplites fighting in an organized battle line. \n\nHomer used the term
    to differentiate the formation-based combat from the individual duels so often
    found in his poems.Historians have not arrived at a consensus about the relationship
    between the Greek formation and these predecessors of the hoplites. \n\nThe principles
    of shield wall and spear hedge were almost universally known among the armies
    of major civilizations throughout history, and so the similarities may be related
    to convergent evolution instead of diffusion.\nTraditionally, historians date
    the origin of the hoplite phalanx of ancient Greece to the 8th century BC in
    Sparta, but this is under revision. \n\nIt is perhaps more likely that the formation
    was devised in the 7th century BC after the introduction of the aspis by the
    city of Argos, which would have made the formation possible. \n\nThis is further
    evidenced by the Chigi vase, dated to 650 BC, identifying hoplites armed with
    aspis, spear and panoply.Another possible theory as to the birth of Greek phalanx
    warfare stems from the idea that some of the basic aspects of the phalanx were
    present in earlier times yet were not fully developed due to the lack of appropriate
    technology. \n\nTwo of the basic tactics seen in earlier warfare include the
    principle of cohesion and the use of large groups of soldiers. \n\nThis would
    suggest that the Greek phalanx was rather the culmination and perfection of a
    slowly developed idea that originated many years earlier. \n\nAs weaponry and
    armour advanced through the years in different city-states, the phalanx became
    complex and effective.\n\n\n== Overview ==\n\nThe hoplite phalanx of the Archaic
    and Classical periods in Greece (c. 800\u2013350 BC) was the formation in which
    the hoplites would line up in ranks in close order. \n\nThe hoplites would lock
    their shields together, and the first few ranks of soldiers would project their
    spears out over the first rank of shields. \n\nThe phalanx therefore presented
    a shield wall and a mass of spear points to the enemy, making frontal assaults
    against it very difficult. \n\nIt also allowed a higher proportion of the soldiers
    to be actively engaged in combat at a given time (rather than just those in the
    front rank).\nBattles between two phalanxes usually took place in open, flat
    plains where it was easier to advance and stay in formation. \n\nRough terrain
    or hilly regions would have made it difficult to maintain a steady line and would
    have defeated the purpose of a phalanx. \n\nAs a result, battles between Greek
    city-states would not take place in just any location, nor would they be limited
    to sometimes obvious strategic points. \n\nRather, many times, the two opposing
    sides would find the most suitable piece of land where the conflict could be
    settled. \n\nTypically, the battle ended with one of the two fighting forces
    fleeing to safety.The phalanx usually advanced at a walking pace, although it
    is possible that they picked up speed during the last several yards. \n\nOne
    of the main reasons for this slow approach was to maintain formation. \n\nThe
    formation would be rendered useless if the phalanx was lost as the unit approached
    the enemy and could even become detrimental to the advancing unit, resulting
    in a weaker formation that was easier for an enemy force to break through. \n\nIf
    the hoplites of the phalanx were to pick up speed toward the latter part of the
    advance, it would have been for the purpose of gaining momentum against the enemy
    in the initial collision. \n\nHerodotus states of the Greeks at the Battle of
    Marathon, that \"They were the first Greeks we know of to charge their enemy
    at a run\". \n\nMany historians believe that this innovation was precipitated
    by their desire to minimize their losses from Persian archery. \n\nThe opposing
    sides would collide, possibly severing many of the spears of the row in front
    and killing the front part of the enemy army due to the bone-breaking collision.\nThe
    spears of a phalanx had spiked butts. \n\nIn battle, the back ranks used the
    spikes to finish fallen enemy soldiers.\n\n\n=== Pushing ===\n\nThe \"physical
    pushing match\" theory is one where the battle would rely on the valour of the
    men in the front line, whilst those in the rear maintained forward pressure on
    the front ranks with their shields, and the whole formation would consistently
    press forward trying to break the enemy formation. \n\nThis is the most widely
    accepted interpretation of the ancient sources thus when two phalanx formations
    engaged, the struggle essentially became a pushing match. \n\nHistorians such
    as Victor Davis Hanson point out that it is difficult to account for exceptionally
    deep phalanx formations unless they were necessary to facilitate the physical
    pushing depicted by this theory, as those behind the first two ranks could not
    take part in the actual spear thrusting.No Greek art ever depicts anything like
    a phalanx pushing match, so this hypothesis is a product of educated speculation
    rather than explicit testimony from contemporary sources and is far from being
    academically resolved. \n\nThe Greek term for \"push\" was used in the same metaphorical
    manner as the English word is (for example it was also used to describe the process
    of rhetorical arguments) and so does not necessarily describe a literal physical
    push, although it is possible that it did.\nFor instance, if Othismos were to
    accurately describe a physical pushing match, it would be logical to state that
    the deeper phalanx would always win an engagement since the physical strength
    of individuals would not compensate for even one additional rank on the enemy
    side. \n\nHowever, there are numerous examples of shallow phalanxes holding off
    an opponent. \n\nFor instance, at Delium in 424 BC, the Athenian left flank,
    a formation eight men deep, held off a formation of Thebans 25 deep without immediate
    collapse. \n\nIt is difficult with the physical pushing model to imagine eight
    men withstanding the pushing force of 25 opponents for a matter of seconds, let
    alone half the battle.\nSuch arguments have led to a wave of counter-criticism
    to physical shoving theorists. \n\nAdrian Goldsworthy, in his article \"The Othismos,
    Myths and Heresies: The nature of Hoplite Battle\", argues that the physical
    pushing match model does not fit with the average casualty figures of hoplite
    warfare nor the practical realities of moving large formations of men in battle.
    \n\nThis debate has yet to be resolved amongst scholars.\nPractical difficulties
    with this theory also include the fact that, in a shoving match, an eight-foot
    spear is too long to fight effectively or even parry attacks. \n\nSpears enable
    a formation of men to keep their enemies at a distance, parry attacks aimed at
    them and their comrades, and give the necessary reach to strike multiple men
    in the opposite formation. \n\nA pushing match would put enemies so close together
    that a quick stabbing with a knife would kill the front row almost instantly.
    \n\nThe crush of men would also prevent the formation from withdrawing or retreating,
    which would result in much higher casualties than is recorded. \n\nThe speed
    at which this would occur would also end the battle very quickly, instead of
    prolonging it for hours.\n\n\n=== Shields ===\n\nEach individual hoplite carried
    his shield on his left arm, protecting not only himself but also the soldier
    to the left. \n\nThis meant that the men at the extreme right of the phalanx
    were only half-protected. \n\nIn battle, opposing phalanxes would try to exploit
    this weakness by attempting to overlap the enemy's right flank. \n\nIt also meant
    that, in battle, a phalanx would tend to drift to the right (as hoplites sought
    to remain behind the shield of their neighbor). \n\nSome groups, such as the
    Spartans at Nemea, tried to use this phenomenon to their advantage. \n\nIn this
    case, the phalanx would sacrifice its left side, which typically consisted of
    allied troops, in an effort to overtake the enemy from the flank. \n\nIt is unlikely
    that this strategy worked very often, as it is not mentioned frequently in ancient
    Greek literature.There was a leader in each row of a phalanx, and a rear rank
    officer, the ouragos (meaning tail-leader), who kept order in the rear. \n\nThe
    hoplites had to trust their neighbors to protect them and in turn be willing
    to protect their neighbors; a phalanx was thus only as strong as its weakest
    elements. \n\nThe effectiveness of the phalanx therefore depended on how well
    the hoplites could maintain this formation in combat and how well they could
    stand their ground, especially when engaged against another phalanx. \n\nFor
    this reason, the formation was deliberately organized to group friends and family
    close together, thus providing a psychological incentive to support one's fellows,
    and a disincentive, through shame, to panic or attempt to flee. \n\nThe more
    disciplined and courageous the army, the more likely it was to win \u2013 often
    engagements between the various city-states of Greece would be resolved by one
    side fleeing before the battle. \n\nThe Greek word dynamis, the 'will to fight',
    expresses the drive that kept hoplites in formation.\n\nNow of those, who dare,
    abiding one beside another, to advance to the close fray, and the foremost champions,
    fewer die, and they save the people in the rear; but in men that fear, all excellence
    is lost. \n\nNo one could ever in words go through those several ills, which
    befall a man, if he has been actuated by cowardice. \n\nFor 'tis grievous to
    wound in the rear the back of a flying man in hostile war. \n\nShameful too is
    a corpse lying low in the dust, wounded behind in the back by the point of a
    spear.\n\n\n=== Hoplite armament ===\n\nEach hoplite provided his own equipment.
    \n\nThe primary hoplite weapon was a spear around 2.4 metres (7.9 ft) in length
    called a dory. \n\nAlthough accounts of its length vary, it is usually now believed
    to have been seven to nine feet long (~2.1\u20132.7 m). \n\nIt was held one-handed,
    with the other hand holding the hoplite's shield (aspis). \n\nThe spearhead was
    usually a curved leaf shape, while the rear of the spear had a spike called a
    sauroter ('lizard-killer') which was used to stand the spear in the ground (hence
    the name). \n\nIt was also used as a secondary weapon if the main shaft snapped
    or to kill enemies lying on the ground. \n\nThis was a common problem, especially
    for soldiers who were involved in the initial clash with the enemy. \n\nDespite
    the snapping of the spear, hoplites could easily switch to the sauroter without
    great consequence. \n\nThe rear ranks used the secondary end to finish off fallen
    opponents as the phalanx advanced over them.\nThroughout the hoplite era, the
    standard hoplite armour went through many cyclical changes. \n\nAn Archaic hoplite
    typically wore a bronze breastplate, a bronze helmet with cheekplates, as well
    as greaves and other armour. \n\nLater, in the classical period, the breastplate
    became less common, replaced instead with a corselet that some claim was made
    of linothorax (layers of linen glued together), or perhaps of leather, sometimes
    covered in whole or in part with overlapping metal scales. \n\nEventually, even
    greaves became less commonly used, although degrees of heavier armour remained,
    as attested by Xenophon as late as 401 BC.These changes reflected the balancing
    of mobility with protection, especially as cavalry became more prominent in the
    Peloponnesian War and the need to combat light troops, which were increasingly
    used to negate the hoplite's role as the primary force in battle. \n\nYet bronze
    armour remained in some form until the end of the hoplite era. \n\nSome archaeologists
    have pointed out that bronze armour does not actually provide as much protection
    from direct blows as more extensive corselet padding, and have suggested its
    continued use was a matter of status for those who could afford it. \n\nIn the
    classical Greek dialect, there is no word for swordsmen; yet hoplites also carried
    a short sword called the xiphos, used as a secondary weapon if the dory was broken
    or lost. \n\nSamples of the xiphos recovered at excavation sites were typically
    around 60 cm (24 in) in length. \n\nThese swords were double-edged and could
    therefore be used as a cutting and thrusting weapon. \n\nThese short swords were
    often used to stab or cut at the enemy's neck during close combat.Hoplites carried
    a circular shield called a hoplon (often referred to as an aspis) made from wood
    and covered in bronze, measuring roughly 1 metre (3.3 ft) in diameter. \n\nIt
    spanned from chin to knee and was very heavy (8\u201315 kg (18\u201333 lb)).
    \n\nThis medium-sized shield (fairly large for the period considering the average
    male height) was made possible partly by its dish-like shape, which allowed it
    to be supported with the rim on the shoulder. \n\nThis was quite an important
    feature of the shield, especially for the hoplites that remained in the latter
    ranks. \n\nWhile these soldiers continued to help press forward, they did not
    have the added burden of holding up their shield. \n\nBut the circular shield
    was not without its disadvantages. \n\nDespite its mobility, protective curve,
    and double straps the circular shape created gaps in the shield wall at both
    its top and bottom. (Top gaps were somewhat reduced by the one or two spears
    jutting out of the gap. \n\nIn order to minimize the bottom gaps, thick leather
    'curtains' were used but only by an [unknown] percentage of the hoplites, possibly
    mostly in the first row only since there were disadvantages as well: considerable
    added weight on an already heavy shield and a certain additional cost.) These
    gaps left parts of the hoplite exposed to potentially lethal spear thrusts and
    were a persistent vulnerability for hoplites controlling the front lines.\n\n\n===
    Phalangite armament ===\n\nThe phalanx of the Ancient Macedonian kingdom and
    the later Hellenistic successor states was a development of the hoplite phalanx.
    \n\nThe 'phalangites' were armed with a much longer spear, the sarissa, and less
    heavily armoured. \n\nThe sarissa was the pike used by the ancient Macedonian
    army. \n\nIts actual length is unknown, but apparently it was twice as long as
    the dory. \n\nThis makes it at least 14 feet (4.3 m), but 18 feet (5.5 m) appears
    more likely. (The cavalry xyston was 12.5 feet (3.8 m) by comparison.) The great
    length of the pike was balanced by a counterweight at the rear end, which also
    functioned as a butt-spike, allowing the sarissa to be planted into the ground.
    \n\nBecause of its great length, weight and different balance, a sarissa was
    wielded two-handed. \n\nThis meant that the aspis was no longer a practical defence.
    \n\nInstead, the phalangites strapped a smaller pelte shield (usually reserved
    for peltasts, light skirmishers) to their left forearm. \n\nRecent theories,
    including examination of ancient frescoes depicting full sets of weapons and
    armor, claim that the shields used were actually larger than the pelte but smaller
    than the aspis, hanging by leather strap(s) from the left shoulder or from both
    shoulders. \n\nThe shield would retain handling straps in the inner curve, to
    be handled like a (smaller) aspis if the fight progressed to sword-wielding.
    \n\nAlthough in both shield size assumptions this reduced the shield wall, the
    extreme length of the spear kept the enemy at a greater distance, as the pikes
    of the first three to five ranks could all be brought to bear in front of the
    front row. \n\nThis pike had to be held underhand, as the shield would have obscured
    the soldier's vision had it been held overhead. \n\nIt would also be very hard
    to remove a sarissa from anything it stuck in (the earth, shields, and soldiers
    of the opposition) if it were thrust downwards, due to its length. \n\nThe Macedonian
    phalanx was much less able to form a shield wall, but the lengthened spears would
    have compensated for this. \n\nSuch a phalanx formation also reduced the likelihood
    that battles would degenerate into a pushing match.\n\n\n== Deployment and combat
    ==\n\n=== Phalanx composition and strength ===\n\nThe basic combat element of
    the Greek armies was either the stichos (meaning 'file'; usually 8\u201316 men
    strong) or the enomotia (meaning 'sworn' and made up by 2\u20134 stich\u0153,
    totaling up to 32 men), both led by a dim\u0153rites who was assisted by a decadarchos
    and two decaster\u0153 (sing. decasteros). \n\nFour to a maximum of 32 enomoti\xE6
    (depending on the era in question or the city) were forming a lochos led by a
    lochagos, who in this way was in command of initially 100 hoplites to a maximum
    of c. 500 in the late Hellenistic armies. \n\nHere, it has to be noted that the
    military manuals of Asclepiodotus and Aelian use the term lochos to denote a
    file in the phalanx. \n\nA taxis (mora for the Spartans) was the greatest standard
    hoplitic formation of 500 to 1500 men, led by a strategos (general). \n\nThe
    entire army, a total of several taxeis or mor\xE6 was led by a generals' council.
    \n\nThe commander-in-chief was usually called a polemarchos or a strategos autocrator.\n\n\n===
    Phalanx front and depth ===\n\nHoplite phalanxes usually deployed in ranks of
    eight men or more deep; the Macedonian phalanxes were usually 16 men deep, sometimes
    reported to have been arrayed 32 men deep. \n\nThere are some notable extremes;
    at the battles of Leuctra and Mantinea, the Theban general Epaminondas arranged
    the left wing of the phalanx into a \"hammerhead\" of 50 ranks of elite hoplites
    deep (see below) and when depth was less important, phalanxes just four deep
    are recorded, as at the battle of Marathon.The phalanx depth could vary depending
    on the needs of the moment and plans of the general. \n\nWhile the phalanx was
    in march, an eis bathos formation (loose, meaning literally 'in depth') was adopted
    in order to move more freely and maintain order. \n\nThis was also the initial
    battle formation as, in addition, it permitted friendly units to pass through
    whether assaulting or retreating. \n\nIn this status, the phalanx had twice the
    normal depth and each hoplite had to occupy about 1.8\u20132 metres (5 ft 11
    in\u20136 ft 7 in) in width. \n\nWhen enemy infantry was approaching, a rapid
    switch to the pycne (spelled also pucne) formation (dense or tight formation)
    was necessary. \n\nIn that case, each man's space was halved (0.9\u20131 metre
    or 2 feet 11 inches\u20133 feet 3 inches in width) and the formation depth returned
    to normal. \n\nAn even denser formation, the synaspismos or sunaspismos (ultra-tight
    or locked shields formation), was used when the phalanx was expected to experience
    extra pressure, intense missile volleys or frontal cavalry charges. \n\nIn synaspismos,
    the rank depth was half that of a normal phalanx and the width each man occupied
    was as small as 0.45 metres (1.5 ft).\n\n\n=== Stages of combat ===\n\nSeveral
    stages in hoplite combat can be defined:\nEphodos: The hoplites stop singing
    their p\xE6anes (battle hymns) and move towards the enemy, gradually picking
    up pace and momentum. \n\nIn the instants before impact, war cries (alalagm\u0153,
    sing. alalagmos) would be made. \n\nNotable war cries were the Athenian (eleleleleu!
    eleleleleu!) and the Macedonian (alalalalai! alalalalai!) alalagm\u0153.\nKrousis:
    The opposing phalanxes meet each other almost simultaneously along their front.
    \nDoratismos: Repeated, rapid spear thrusts in order to disrupt the enemy formation.
    \n\nThe use of long spears would keep enemies apart as well as allow men in a
    row to assist their comrades next to them. \n\nThe prodding could also open up
    a man to allow a comrade to spear him. \n\nToo hard prodding could get a spear
    stuck in a shield, which would necessitate someone in the back to lend his to
    the now-disarmed man.\nOthismos: Literally 'pushing' after most spears have been
    broken, the hoplites begin to push with their spears and spear shafts against
    their opponents' shields. \n\nThis could be the longest phase.Pararrhexis: 'Breaching'
    the opposing phalanx, the enemy formation shatters and the battle ends. \n\nCavalry
    would be used at this point to mop up the scattered enemy.\n\n\n== Tactics ==\n\nThe
    early history of the phalanx is largely one of combat between hoplite armies
    from competing Greek city-states. \n\nThe usual result was rather identical,
    inflexible formations pushing against each other until one broke. \n\nThe potential
    of the phalanx to achieve something more was demonstrated at Battle of Marathon
    (490 BC). \n\nFacing the much larger army of Darius I, the Athenians thinned
    out their phalanx and consequently lengthened their front, to avoid being outflanked.
    \n\nHowever, even a reduced-depth phalanx proved unstoppable to the lightly armed
    Persian infantry. \n\nAfter routing the Persian wings, the hoplites on the Athenian
    wings wheeled inwards, destroying the elite troop at the Persian centre, resulting
    in a crushing victory for Athens. \n\nThroughout the Greco-Persian Wars the hoplite
    phalanx was to prove superior to the Persian infantry (e.g. the battles of Thermopylae
    and Plataea).\nPerhaps the most prominent example of the phalanx's evolution
    was the oblique order, made famous in the Battle of Leuctra. \n\nThere, the Theban
    general Epaminondas thinned out the right flank and centre of his phalanx, and
    deepened his left flank to an unheard-of 50 men deep. \n\nIn doing so, Epaminondas
    reversed the convention by which the right flank of the phalanx was strongest.
    \n\nThis allowed the Thebans to assault in strength the elite Spartan troops
    on the right flank of the opposing phalanx. \n\nMeanwhile, the centre and right
    flank of the Theban line were echeloned back, from the opposing phalanx, keeping
    the weakened parts of the formation from being engaged. \n\nOnce the Spartan
    right had been routed by the Theban left, the remainder of the Spartan line also
    broke. \n\nThus, by localising the attacking power of the hoplites, Epaminondas
    was able to defeat an enemy previously thought invincible.\nPhilip II of Macedon
    spent several years in Thebes as a hostage, and paid attention to Epaminondas'
    innovations. \n\nOn return to his homeland, he raised a revolutionary new infantry
    force, which was to change the face of the Greek world. \n\nPhilip's phalangites
    were the first force of professional soldiers seen in Ancient Greece apart from
    Sparta. \n\nThey were armed with longer spears (the sarissa) and were drilled
    more thoroughly in more evolved, complicated tactics and manoeuvres. \n\nMore
    importantly, though, Philip's phalanx was part of a multi-faceted, combined force
    that included a variety of skirmishers and cavalry, most notably the famous Companion
    cavalry. \n\nThe Macedonian phalanx now was used to pin the centre of the enemy
    line, while cavalry and more mobile infantry struck at the foe's flanks. \n\nIts
    supremacy over the more static armies fielded by the Greek city-states was shown
    at the Battle of Chaeronea, where Philip II's army crushed the allied Theban
    and Athenian phalanxes.\n\n\n== Weaknesses ==\n\nThe hoplite phalanx was weakest
    when facing an enemy fielding lighter and more flexible troops without its own
    such supporting troops. \n\nAn example of this would be the Battle of Lechaeum,
    where an Athenian contingent led by Iphicrates routed an entire Spartan mora
    (a unit of anywhere from 500 to 900 hoplites). \n\nThe Athenian force had a considerable
    proportion of light missile troops armed with javelins and bows that wore down
    the Spartans with repeated attacks, causing disarray in the Spartan ranks and
    an eventual rout when they spotted Athenian heavy infantry reinforcements trying
    to flank them by boat.\nThe Macedonian phalanx had weaknesses similar to its
    hoplitic predecessor. \n\nTheoretically indestructible from the front, its flanks
    and rear were very vulnerable, and once engaged it may not easily disengage or
    redeploy to face a threat from those directions. \n\nThus, a phalanx facing non-phalangite
    formations required some sort of protection on its flanks\u2014lighter or at
    least more mobile infantry, cavalry, etc. \n\nThis was shown at the Battle of
    Magnesia, where, once the Seleucid supporting cavalry elements were driven off,
    the phalanx was static and unable to go on the offensive against its Roman opponents
    (although they continued to resist stoutly and attempted a fighting withdrawal
    under a hail of Roman missiles, until the elephants posted on their flanks panicked
    and disrupted their formation).\nThe Macedonian phalanx could also lose its cohesion
    without proper coordination or while moving through broken terrain; doing so
    could create gaps between individual blocks/syntagmata, or could prevent a solid
    front within those sub-units as well, causing other sections of the line to bunch
    up. \n\nIn this event, as in the battles of Cynoscephalae and Pydna, the phalanx
    became vulnerable to attacks by more flexible units\u2014such as Roman legionary
    centuries, which were able to avoid the sarissae and engage in hand-to-hand combat
    with the phalangites.\nAnother important area that must be considered concerns
    the psychological tendencies of the hoplites. \n\nBecause the strength of a phalanx
    depended on the ability of the hoplites to maintain their frontline, it was crucial
    that a phalanx be able to quickly and efficiently replace fallen soldiers in
    the front ranks. \n\nIf a phalanx failed to do this in a structured manner, the
    opposing phalanx would have an opportunity to breach the line which, many times,
    would lead to a quick defeat. \n\nThis then implies that the hoplites ranks closer
    to the front must be mentally prepared to replace their fallen comrade and adapt
    to his new position without disrupting the structure of the frontline.Finally,
    most of the phalanx-centric armies tended to lack supporting echelons behind
    the main line of battle. \n\nThis meant that breaking through the line of battle
    or compromising one of its flanks often ensured victory.\n\n\n== Classical decline
    and post-classical use ==\n\nAfter reaching its zenith in the conquests of Alexander
    the Great, the phalanx began a slow decline, as Macedonian successor states declined.
    \n\nThe combined arms tactics used by Alexander and his father were gradually
    replaced by a return to the simpler frontal charge tactics of the hoplite phalanx.
    \n\nThe expense of the supporting arms and cavalry, and the widespread use of
    mercenaries, caused the Diadochi to rely on phalanx vs. phalanx tactics during
    the Wars of the Diadochi.\nThe decline of the Diadochi and the phalanx was linked
    with the rise of Rome and the Roman legions from the 3rd century BC. \n\nThe
    Battle of the Caudine Forks showed the clumsiness of the Roman phalanx against
    the Samnites. \n\nThe Romans had originally employed the phalanx themselves but
    gradually evolved more flexible tactics. \n\nThe result was the three-line Roman
    legion of the middle period of the Roman Republic, the Manipular System. \n\nRomans
    used a phalanx for their third military line, the triarii. \n\nThese were veteran
    reserve troops armed with the hastae or spear. \n\nRome conquered most of the
    Macedonian successor states. \n\nAlso the various Greek city-states and leagues.
    \n\nAs these states ceased to exist, so did the armies which used the traditional
    phalanx. \n\nSubsequently, troops from these regions were equipped, trained and
    fought using the Roman model.\nA phalanx formation called the phoulkon appeared
    in the late Roman army and Byzantine army. \n\nIt had characteristics of the
    classical Greek and Hellenistic phalanxes, but was more flexible. \n\nIt was
    used against cavalry more than infantry.\nHowever, the phalanx did not totally
    disappear. \n\nIn some battles between the Roman army and Hellenistic phalanxes,
    such as Pydna (168 BC), Cynoscephalae (197 BC) and Magnesia (190 BC), the phalanx
    performed well. \n\nIt even drove back the Roman infantry. \n\nHowever, at Cynoscephalae
    and Magnesia, failure to defend the flanks of the phalanx led to defeat. \n\nAt
    Pydna, the phalanx lost cohesion when pursuing retreating Roman soldiers. \n\nThis
    allowed the Romans to penetrate the formation. \n\nThen, Roman close combat skills
    proved decisive. \n\nThe historian Polybius details the effectiveness of the
    Roman legion against the phalanx. \n\nHe deduces that the Romans refused to fight
    the phalanx where the phalanx was effective, Romans offered battle only when
    a legion could exploit the clumsiness and immobility of a phalanx.\n\nSpear-armed
    troops continued to be important elements in many armies until reliable firearms
    became available. \n\nThese did not necessarily fight as a phalanx. \n\nFor example,
    compare the classical phalanx and late medieval pike formations.Military historians
    have suggested that the Scots under William Wallace and Robert the Bruce consciously
    imitated the Hellenistic phalanx to produce the Scots 'hedgehog' or schiltron.
    \n\nHowever, long spears might have been used by Picts and others in Scotlands'
    Early Middle Ages. \n\nPrior to 1066, long spear tactics (also found in North
    Wales) might have been part of irregular warfare in Britain. \n\nThe Scots used
    imported French pikes and dynamic tactics at the Battle of Flodden. \n\nHowever,
    Flodden found the Scots pitted against effective light artillery, while advancing
    over bad ground. \n\nThe combination disorganised the Scotts phalanxes and permitted
    effective attacks by English longbowmen, and soldiers wielding shorter, handier
    polearms called bills. \n\nSome contemporary sources might say that the bills
    cut off the heads of Scots pikes.\nThe pike was briefly reconsidered as a weapon
    by European armies in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. \n\nIt could protect
    riflemen, whose slower rate of fire made them vulnerable. \n\nA collapsible pike
    was invented but never issued. \n\nThe Confederate Army considered these for
    the American Civil War. \n\nSome were even manufactured but probably were never
    issued. \n\nPikes were manufactured during World War II as \"Croft's Pikes\".\nWhile
    obsolete in military practice, the phalanx remained in use as a metaphor of warriors
    moving forward as a single united block. \n\nThis metaphor inspired several 20th-century
    political movements, notably the Spanish Falange and its ideology of Falangism.\nThe
    Byzantines continued and improved the use of the classical Greek phalanx alongside
    the Macedonian-style phalanx. \n\nThe latter was based on a model that Alexander
    himself had created and had tried to give more importance to the skirmishers
    and cavalry, yet it never saw action until the Byzantines adopted the model that
    rely in a mixture of many units sometimes. \n\nMany writers of the age describe
    the spear as being a sarissa yet it was a meter short than the original sarissa
    and had being modified by the time, yet the term for the long spear remained
    alongside with its other names.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phalanx"

  descriptionText: "\n\nHYOID BONE\n\n\nThe hyoid bone (lingual bone or tongue-bone)
    () is a horseshoe-shaped bone situated in the anterior midline of the neck between
    the chin and the thyroid cartilage. \n\nAt rest, it lies at the level of the
    base of the mandible in the front and the third cervical vertebra (C3) behind.\n\nUnlike
    other bones, the hyoid is only distantly articulated to other bones by muscles
    or ligaments. \n\nThe hyoid is anchored by muscles from the anterior, posterior
    and inferior directions, and aids in tongue movement and swallowing. \n\nThe
    hyoid bone provides attachment to the muscles of the floor of the mouth and the
    tongue above, the larynx below, and the epiglottis and pharynx behind.\n\nIts
    name is derived from Greek hyoeides 'shaped like the letter upsilon (\u03C5)'.\n\n\n==
    Structure ==\n\nThe hyoid bone is classed as an irregular bone and consists of
    a central part called the body, and two pairs of horns, the greater and lesser
    horns.\n\n\n=== Body ===\n\nThe body of the hyoid bone is the central part of
    the hyoid bone.\n\nAt the front, the body is convex and directed forward and
    upward.\n\nIt is crossed in its upper half by a well-marked transverse ridge
    with a slight downward convexity, and in many cases a vertical median ridge divides
    it into two lateral halves.\n\nThe portion of the vertical ridge above the transverse
    line is present in a majority of specimens, but the lower portion is evident
    only in rare cases.\n\nThe anterior surface gives insertion to the geniohyoid
    muscle in the greater part of its extent both above and below the transverse
    ridge; a portion of the origin of the hyoglossus notches the lateral margin of
    the geniohyoid attachment.\n\nBelow the transverse ridge the mylohyoid, sternohyoid,
    and omohyoid are inserted.\n\nAt the back, the smooth, concave, directed backward
    and downward, and separated from the epiglottis by the hyothyroid membrane and
    a quantity of loose areolar tissue; a bursa intervenes between it and the hyothyroid
    membrane.\n\nAbove, the body is rounded, and gives attachment to the hyothyroid
    membrane and some aponeurotic fibers of the genioglossus.\n\nBelow, the body
    affords insertion medially to the sternohyoid and laterally to the omohyoid and
    occasionally a portion of the thyrohyoid. \n\nIt also gives attachment to the
    Levator glandulae thyreoideae, when this muscle is present.\n\n\n=== Horns ===\n\nThe
    greater and lesser horns (Latin: cornua) are two sections of bone that project
    from each side of the hyoid.\n\nThe greater horns project backward from the outer
    borders of the body; they are flattened from above downward and taper to their
    end, which is a bony tubercle connecting to the lateral thyrohyoid ligament.
    \n\nThe upper surface of the greater horns are rough and close to its lateral
    border, and facilitates muscular attachment. \n\nThe largest of muscles that
    attach to the upper surface of the greater horns are the hyoglossus and the middle
    pharyngeal constrictor, which extend along the whole length of the horns; the
    digastric muscle and stylohyoid muscle have small insertions in front of these
    near the junction of the body with the horns. \n\nTo the medial border the thyrohyoid
    membrane is attached, while the anterior half of the lateral border gives insertion
    to the thyrohyoid muscle.\n\nThe lesser horns are two small, conical eminences,
    attached by their bases to the angles of junction between the body and greater
    horns of the hyoid bone. \n\nThey are connected to the body of the bone by fibrous
    tissue, and occasionally to the greater horns by distinct diarthrodial joints,
    which usually persist throughout life, but occasionally become ankylosed. \n\nThe
    lesser horns are situated in the line of the transverse ridge on the body and
    appear to be continuations of it. \n\nThe apex of each horn gives attachment
    to the stylohyoid ligament; the chondroglossus rises from the medial side of
    the base.\n\n\n=== Development ===\n\nThe second pharyngeal arch, also called
    the hyoid arch, gives rise to the lesser cornu of the hyoid and the upper part
    of the body of the hyoid. \n\nThe cartilage of the third pharyngeal arch forms
    the greater cornu of the hyoid and the lower portion of the body of the hyoid.\nThe
    greater horns derive from the third pharyngeal arch. \n\nThe lesser horns are
    derived from the second pharyngeal arch also called the hyoid arch.The hyoid
    is ossified from six centers: two for the body, and one for each cornu. \n\nOssification
    commences in the greater cornua toward the end of fetal development, in the hyoid
    body shortly afterward, and in the lesser cornua during the first or second year
    after birth. \n\nUntil middle age the connection between the body and greater
    cornu is fibrous.\n\nIn early life the outer borders of the body are connected
    to the greater horns by synchondroses; after middle life usually by bony union.\n\n\n===
    Blood supply ===\n\nBlood is supplied to the hyoid bone via the lingual artery,
    which runs down from the tongue to the greater horns of the bone. \n\nThe suprahyoid
    branch of the lingual artery runs along the upper border of the hyoid bone and
    supplies blood to the attached muscles.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\nThe hyoid bone
    is present in many mammals. \n\nIt allows a wider range of tongue, pharyngeal
    and laryngeal movements by bracing these structures alongside each other in order
    to produce variation. \n\nIts descent in living creatures is not unique to Homo
    sapiens, and does not allow the production of a wide range of sounds: with a
    lower larynx, men do not produce a wider range of sounds than women and 2-year-old
    babies. \n\nMoreover, the larynx position of Neanderthals was not a handicap
    to producing speech sounds.  \n\nThe discovery of a modern-looking hyoid bone
    of a Neanderthal man in the Kebara Cave in Israel led its discoverers to argue
    that the Neanderthals had a descended larynx, and thus human-like speech capabilities.
    \n\nHowever, other researchers have claimed that the morphology of the hyoid
    is not indicative of the larynx's position. \n\nIt is necessary to take into
    consideration the skull base, the mandible and the cervical vertebrae and a cranial
    reference plane.\n\n\n=== Muscle attachments ===\n\nA large number of muscles
    attach to the hyoid:\n\n\t\t\n== Clinical significance ==\n\nThe hyoid bone is
    important to a number of physiological functions, including breathing, swallowing
    and speech. \n\nIt is also thought to play a key role in keeping the upper airway
    open during sleep, and as such, the development and treatment of obstructive
    sleep apnea (OSA; characterized by repetitive collapse of the upper airway during
    sleep). \n\nA mechanistic involvement of the hyoid bone in OSA is supported by
    numerous studies demonstrating that a more inferiorly positioned hyoid bone is
    strongly associated with the presence and severity of the disorder. \n\nMovement
    of the hyoid bone is also thought to be important in modifying upper airway properties,
    which was recently demonstrated in computer model simulations. \n\nA surgical
    procedure that aims to potentially increase and improve the airway is called
    hyoid suspension.\nDue to its position, the hyoid bone is not easily susceptible
    to fracture. \n\nIn a suspected case of murder or physical abuse, a fractured
    hyoid strongly indicates throttling or strangulation in an adult. \n\nHowever,
    that is not necessarily the case in children and adolescents, in whom the hyoid
    bone is still flexible, because ossification is yet to be completed.\n\n\n==
    Other animals ==\n\nThe hyoid bone is derived from the lower half of the second
    gill arch in fish, which separates the first gill slit from the spiracle, and
    is often called the hyoid arch. \n\nIn many animals, it also incorporates elements
    of other gill arches, and has a correspondingly greater number of cornua. \n\nAmphibians
    and reptiles may have many cornua, while mammals (including humans) have two
    pairs, and birds only one. \n\nIn birds, and some reptiles, the body of the hyoid
    is greatly extended forward, creating a solid bony support for the tongue. \n\nThe
    howler monkey Alouatta has a pneumatized hyoid bone, one of the few cases of
    postcranial pneumatization of bones outside Saurischia.\n\nIn veterinary anatomy,
    the term hyoid apparatus is the collective term used to refer to the bones of
    the tongue \u2014 a pair of stylohyoidea, a pair of thyrohyoidea, and unpaired
    basihyoideum \u2014 and associated, upper-gular connective tissues. \n\nIn humans,
    the single hyoid bone is an equivalent of the hyoid apparatus.\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyoid_bone"

    BODY OF STERNUM



    The body, or gladiolus, is the
    longest sternal part.


    It is flat and considered to have only a front and
    back surface.


    It is flat on the front, directed upward and forward, and
    marked by three transverse ridges which cross the bone opposite the third, fourth,
    and fifth articular depressions.


    The pectoralis major attaches to it on
    either side.


    At the junction of the third and fourth parts of the body
    is occasionally seen an orifice, the sternal foramen, of varying size and form.


    The
    posterior surface, slightly concave, is also marked by three transverse lines,
    less distinct, however, than those in front; from its lower part, on either side,
    the transversus thoracis takes origin.


    The sternal angle is located at
    the point where the body joins the manubrium.


    The sternal angle can be
    felt at the point where the sternum projects farthest forward.


    However,
    in some people the sternal angle is concave or rounded.


    During physical
    examinations, the sternal angle is a useful landmark because the second rib attaches
    here.


    Each outer border, at its superior angle, has a small facet, which
    with a similar facet on the manubrium, forms a cavity for the cartilage of the
    second rib; below this are four angular depressions which receive the cartilages
    of the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth ribs.


    The inferior angle has a small
    facet, which, with a corresponding one on the xiphoid process, forms a notch
    for the cartilage of the seventh rib.


    These articular depressions are separated
    by a series of curved interarticular intervals, which diminish in length from
    above downward, and correspond to the intercostal spaces.


    Most of the cartilages
    belonging to the true ribs, articulate with the sternum at the lines of junction
    of its primitive component segments.


    This is well seen in some other vertebrates,
    where the parts of the bone remain separated for longer.


    The upper border
    is oval and articulates with the manubrium, at the sternal angle.


    The lower
    border is narrow, and articulates with the xiphoid process.

  descriptionText: "\n\nCERVICAL VERTEBRAE\n\n\nIn tetrapods, cervical vertebrae
    (singular: vertebra) are the vertebrae of the neck, immediately below the skull.
    \n\nTruncal vertebrae (divided into thoracic and lumbar vertebrae in mammals)
    lie caudal (toward the tail) of cervical vertebrae. \n\nIn sauropsid species,
    the cervical vertebrae bear cervical ribs. \n\nIn lizards and saurischian dinosaurs,
    the cervical ribs are large; in birds, they are small and completely fused to
    the vertebrae. \n\nThe vertebral transverse processes of mammals are homologous
    to the cervical ribs of other amniotes. \n\nMost mammals have seven cervical
    vertebrae, with the only three known exceptions being the manatee with six, the
    two-toed sloth with five or six, and the three-toed sloth with nine.\n\nIn humans,
    cervical vertebrae are the smallest of the true vertebrae and can be readily
    distinguished from those of the thoracic or lumbar regions by the presence of
    a foramen (hole) in each transverse process, through which the vertebral artery,
    vertebral veins, and inferior cervical ganglion pass. \n\nThe remainder of this
    article focuses upon human anatomy.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\n\nBy convention,
    the cervical vertebrae are numbered, with the first one (C1) closest to the skull
    and higher numbered vertebrae (C2\u2013C7) proceeding away from the skull and
    down the spine.\n\nThe general characteristics of the third through sixth cervical
    vertebrae are described here. \n\nThe first, second, and seventh vertebrae are
    extraordinary, and are detailed later.\n\nThe bodies of these four vertebrae
    are small, and broader from side to side than from front to back.\n\nThe anterior
    and posterior surfaces are flattened and of equal depth; the former is placed
    on a lower level than the latter, and its inferior border is prolonged downward,
    so as to overlap the upper and forepart of the vertebra below.\n\nThe upper surface
    is concave transversely, and presents a projecting lip on either side.\n\nThe
    lower surface is concave from front to back, convex from side to side, and presents
    laterally shallow concavities that receive the corresponding projecting lips
    of the underlying vertebra.\n\nThe pedicles are directed laterally and backward,
    and attach to the body midway between its upper and lower borders, so that the
    superior vertebral notch is as deep as the inferior, but it is, at the same time,
    narrower.\n\nThe laminae are narrow and thinner above than below; the vertebral
    foramen is large and of a triangular form.\nThe spinous process is short and
    bifid, the two divisions being often of unequal size. \n\nBecause the spinous
    processes are so short, certain superficial muscles (the trapezius and splenius
    capitis) attach to the nuchal ligament rather than directly to the vertebrae;
    the nuchal ligament itself attaching to the spinous processes of C2\u2013C7 and
    to the posterior tubercle of the atlas.\n\nThe superior and inferior articular
    processes of cervical vertebrae have fused on either or both sides to form articular
    pillars, columns of bone that project laterally from the junction of the pedicle
    and lamina.\n\nThe articular facets are flat and of an oval form:\nthe superior
    face backward, upward, and slightly medially.\nthe inferior face forward, downward,
    and slightly laterally.\n\nThe transverse processes are each pierced by the foramen
    transversarium, which, in the upper six vertebrae, gives passage to the vertebral
    artery and vein, as well as a plexus of sympathetic nerves. \n\nEach process
    consists of an anterior and a posterior part. \n\nThese two parts are joined,
    outside the foramen, by a bar of bone that exhibits a deep sulcus on its upper
    surface for the passage of the corresponding spinal nerve.\n\nThe anterior portion
    is the homologue of the rib in the thoracic region, and is therefore named the
    costal process or costal element. \n\nIt arises from the side of the body, is
    directed laterally in front of the foramen, and ends in a tubercle, the anterior
    tubercle.\n\nThe posterior part, the true transverse process, springs from the
    vertebral arch behind the foramen and is directed forward and laterally; it ends
    in a flattened vertical tubercle, the posterior tubercle.\n\nThe anterior tubercle
    of the sixth cervical vertebra is known as the carotid tubercle or Chassaignac
    tubercle (for \xC9douard Chassaignac). \n\nThis separates the carotid artery
    from the vertebral artery and the carotid artery can be massaged against this
    tubercle to relieve the symptoms of supraventricular tachycardia. \n\nThe carotid
    tubercle is also used as a landmark for anaesthesia of the brachial plexus and
    cervical plexus.\n\nThe cervical spinal nerves emerge from above the cervical
    vertebrae. \n\nFor example, the cervical spinal nerve 3 (C3) passes above C3.\n\n\n===
    Atlas and axis ===\n\nThe atlas (C1) and axis (C2) are the two topmost vertebrae.\n\nThe
    atlas (C1) is the topmost vertebra, and along with the axis forms the joint connecting
    the skull and spine. \n\nIt lacks a vertebral body, spinous process, and discs
    either superior or inferior to it. \n\nIt is ring-like and consists of an anterior
    arch, posterior arch, and two lateral masses.\nThe axis (C2) forms the pivot
    on which the atlas rotates. \n\nThe most distinctive characteristic of this bone
    is the strong odontoid process (dens) that rises perpendicularly from the upper
    surface of the body and articulates with C1. \n\nThe body is deeper in front
    than behind, and prolonged downward anteriorly so as to overlap the upper and
    front part of the third vertebra.\n\n\n=== Vertebra prominens ===\n\nThe vertebra
    prominens, or C7, has a distinctive long and prominent spinous process, which
    is palpable from the skin surface. \n\nSometimes, the seventh cervical vertebra
    is associated with an abnormal extra rib, known as a cervical rib, which develops
    from the anterior root of the transverse process. \n\nThese ribs are usually
    small, but may occasionally compress blood vessels (such as the subclavian artery
    or subclavian vein) or nerves in the brachial plexus, causing pain, numbness,
    tingling, and weakness in the upper limb, a condition known as thoracic outlet
    syndrome. \n\nVery rarely, this rib occurs in a pair.\nThe long spinous process
    of C7 is thick and nearly horizontal in direction. \n\nIt is not bifurcated,
    and ends in a tubercle that the ligamentum nuchae attaches to. \n\nThis process
    is not always the most prominent of the spinous processes, being found only about
    70% of the time, C6 or T1 can sometimes be the most prominent.\n\nThe transverse
    processes are of considerable size; their posterior roots are large and prominent,
    while the anterior are small and faintly marked. \n\nThe upper surface of each
    usually has a shallow sulcus for the eighth spinal nerve, and its extremity seldom
    presents more than a trace of bifurcation.\n\nThe transverse foramen may be as
    large as that in the other cervical vertebrae, but it is generally smaller on
    one or both sides; occasionally, it is double, and sometimes it is absent.\n\nOn
    the left side, it occasionally gives passage to the vertebral artery; more frequently,
    the vertebral vein traverses it on both sides, but the usual arrangement is for
    both artery and vein to pass in front of the transverse process, not through
    the foramen.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\nThe movement of nodding the head takes place
    predominantly through flexion and extension at the atlanto-occipital joint between
    the atlas and the occipital bone. \n\nHowever, the cervical spine is comparatively
    mobile, and some component of this movement is due to flexion and extension of
    the vertebral column itself. \n\nThis movement between the atlas and occipital
    bone is often referred to as the \"yes joint\", owing to its nature of being
    able to move the head in an up-and-down fashion.\n\nThe movement of shaking or
    rotating the head left and right happens almost entirely at the joint between
    the atlas and the axis, the atlanto-axial joint. \n\nA small amount of rotation
    of the vertebral column itself contributes to the movement. \n\nThis movement
    between the atlas and axis is often referred to as the \"no joint\", owing to
    its nature of being able to rotate the head in a side-to-side fashion.\n\n\n==
    Clinical significance ==\n\nCervical degenerative changes arise from conditions
    such as spondylosis, stenosis of intervertebral discs, and the formation of osteophytes.
    \n\nThe changes are seen on radiographs, which are used in a grading system from
    0\u20134 ranging from no changes (0) to early with minimal development of osteophytes
    (1) to mild with definite osteophytes (2) to moderate with additional disc space
    stenosis or narrowing (3) to the stage of many large osteophytes, severe narrowing
    of the disc space, and more severe vertebral end plate sclerosis (4).Injuries
    to the cervical spine are common at the level of the second cervical vertebrae,
    but neurological injury is uncommon. \n\nC4 and C5 are the areas that see the
    highest amount of cervical spine trauma.If it does occur, however, it may cause
    death or profound disability, including paralysis of the arms, legs, and diaphragm,
    which leads to respiratory failure.\n\nCommon patterns of injury include the
    odontoid fracture and the hangman's fracture, both of which are often treated
    with immobilization in a cervical collar or Halo brace.\n\nA common practice
    is to immobilize a patient's cervical spine to prevent further damage during
    transport to hospital. \n\nThis practice has come under review recently as incidence
    rates of unstable spinal trauma can be as low as 2% in immobilized patients.
    \n\nIn clearing the cervical spine, Canadian studies have developed the Canadian
    C-Spine Rule (CCR) for physicians to decide who should receive radiological imaging.\n\n\n===
    Landmarks ===\n\nThe vertebral column is often used as a marker of human anatomy.
    \n\nThis includes:\n\nAt C1, base of the nose and the hard palate\nAt C2, the
    teeth of a closed mouth\nAt C3, the mandible and hyoid bone\nAt C4, the common
    carotid artery bifurcates.\nFrom C4\u20135, the thyroid cartilage\nFrom C6\u20137,
    the cricoid cartilage\nAt C6, the oesophagus becomes continuous with the laryngopharynx
    and also where the larynx becomes continuous with the trachea. \n\nIt is also
    the level where the carotid pulse can be palpated against the transverse process
    of the C6 vertebrae.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervical_vertebrae"

  descriptionText: "\n\nCANINE TOOTH\n\n\nIn mammalian oral anatomy, the canine teeth,
    also called cuspids, dog teeth, or (in the context of the upper jaw) fangs, eye
    teeth, vampire teeth, or vampire fangs, are the relatively long, pointed teeth.
    \n\nThey can appear more flattened however, causing them to resemble incisors
    and leading them to be called incisiform. \n\nThey developed and are used primarily
    for firmly holding food in order to tear it apart, and occasionally as weapons.
    \n\nThey are often the largest teeth in a mammal's mouth. \n\nIndividuals of
    most species that develop them normally have four, two in the upper jaw and two
    in the lower, separated within each jaw by incisors; humans and dogs are examples.
    \n\nIn most species, canines are the anterior-most teeth in the maxillary bone.
    \nThe four canines in humans are the two maxillary canines and the two mandibular
    canines.\n\n\n== Details ==\n\nThere are four canine teeth: two in the upper
    (maxillary) and two in the lower (mandibular) arch. \n\nA canine is placed laterally
    to each lateral incisor and mesial to the premolars. \n\nThey are larger and
    stronger than the incisors, and their roots sink deeply into the bones, and cause
    well-marked prominences upon the surface. \n\nThey are the only teeth in dentition
    with a single cusp, their crowns are roughly triangular from mesial view and
    trapezoidal in buccal view.\n\nThe crown is large and conical, very convex on
    its labial surface, a little hollowed and uneven on its lingual surface, and
    tapering to a blunted point or cusp, which projects beyond the level of the other
    teeth. \n\nThe root is single, but longer and thicker than that of the incisors,
    conical in form, compressed laterally, and marked by a slight groove on each
    side. \n\nThe lingual surface also presents two depressions on either side of
    the surface separated by a ridge in between; these depressions are known as mesial
    and distal lingual fossae.\n\n\n=== Eruption ===\n\nIn humans, the upper canine
    teeth (popularly called eye teeth, from their position under the eyes) are larger
    and longer than the lower, and usually present a distinct basal ridge. \n\nEruption
    typically occurs between the ages of eleven and twelve years for upper canines
    and between nine and ten years for lower canines. \n\nUpper deciduous canines
    also known as the baby tooth, typically erupt between ages of sixteen and twenty-two
    months and sheds between ten and twelve years. \n\nLower deciduous canines typically
    erupt between ages of seventeen and twenty-two months and sheds between nine
    to twelve years \n\n\n=== Developmental defects ===\n\nTransposition (positional
    interchange of two adjacent teeth) is a development defect that most commonly
    found in the permanent canine, with the maxillary being more commonly seen than
    mandibular. \n\nThe upper canine frequently transposed with the first premolar
    whilst the lower canine transposed with the lateral incisor. \n\nOccasionally
    canines are congenitally missing.\n\n\n=== Maxillary canine morphology ===\n\nFrom
    a facial aspect, maxillary canines are approximately one millimetre narrower
    than the central incisor. \n\nTheir mesial aspects resemble the adjacent lateral
    incisors, while their distal aspects anticipate the first premolars. \n\nThey
    are slightly darker and more yellow in color than the other anterior teeth. \n\nFrom
    a lingual aspect, they have well developed mesial and distal marginal ridges
    and a well-developed cingulum. \n\nA prominent lingual ridge divides the lingual
    aspect in half and creates the mesial and distal lingual fossae between the lingual
    ridge and the marginal ridges. \n\nFrom a proximal aspect, they resemble the
    incisors, but are more robust, especially in the cingulum region. \n\nIncisally,
    they are visibly asymmetrical, as the mesial incisal edge is slightly shorter
    than the distal incisal edge, which places the cusp slightly mesial to the long
    axis of the tooth. \n\nThey are also thicker labiolingually than mesiodistally.
    \n\nBecause of the disproportionate incisal edges, the contacts are also asymmetrical.
    \n\nMesially, the contact sits at the junction of the incisal and middle third
    of the crown, while distally, the contact as more cervical, in the middle of
    the middle third of the crown.The root of the maxillary canines are the longest
    root of any tooth and conical in shape.\n\n\n=== Mandibular canine morphology
    ===\n\nThe lower canine teeth are placed nearer the middle line than the upper,
    so that their summits correspond to the intervals between the upper canines and
    the lateral incisors. \n\nFrom a facial aspect, the mandibular canine is notably
    narrower mesiodistally than the maxillary one, the root is compressed mesiodistally
    with well-marked grooves on both sides and may be just as long as the maxillary
    (and at times bifurcated). \n\nA distinctive feature is the nearly straight outline
    this tooth has compared to the maxillary canine which is slightly more bowed.
    \n\nAs in the maxillary canine, the mesial incisal edge (or cusp ridge) is shorter
    than the distal side, however, the cusp is displaced slightly lingual relative
    to the cusp of the maxillary canine.\n\nLingually, the surface of the tooth is
    much smoother compared to the very pronounced surface of the maxillary canine,
    and the cingulum is noted as less developed. \n\nThe cusp may be lost with attrition
    over time and may resemble an upper second permanent incisor.\n\n\n== Sexual
    dimorphism ==\n\nWith many species, the canine teeth in the upper or lower jaw,
    or in both, are much larger in the males than in the females, or are absent in
    females, except sometimes a hidden rudiment. \n\nCertain antelopes, the musk-deer,
    camel, horse, boar, various apes, seals, and the walrus, offer instances.\n\n\n==
    In non-synapsids ==\n\nIn non-synapsids (\"mammal-like reptiles\"), teeth similar
    to canines may be termed \"caniniform\" (\"canine-shaped\") teeth.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canine_tooth"

  descriptionText: "\n\nMALLEUS\n\n\nThe malleus, or hammer, is a hammer-shaped small
    bone or ossicle of the middle ear. \n\nIt connects with the incus, and is attached
    to the inner surface of the eardrum. The word is Latin for 'hammer' or 'mallet'.
    \n\nIt transmits the sound vibrations from the eardrum to the incus (anvil).
    \n\n===Structure===\n\nSee also: Ossicles\n\nThe malleus is a bone situated in
    the middle ear. \n\nIt is the first of the three ossicles, and attached to the
    tympanic membrane. \n\nThe head of the malleus is the large protruding section,
    which attaches to the incus. \n\nThe head connects to the neck of malleus. \n\nThe
    bone continues as the handle (or manubrium) of malleus, which connects to the
    tympanic membrane. \n\nBetween the neck and handle of the malleus, lateral and
    anterior processes emerge from the bone. \n\nThe bone is oriented so that the
    head is superior and the handle is inferior.\n\n\n===Development===\n\nEmbryologically,
    the malleus is derived from the first pharyngeal arch along with the incus. \n\nIt
    grows from Meckel's cartilage.\n\n===Function===\n\nMain article: Hearing\n\nThe
    malleus is one of three ossicles in the middle ear which transmit sound from
    the tympanic membrane (ear drum) to the inner ear. \n\nThe malleus receives vibrations
    from the tympanic membrane and transmits this to the incus.\n\n\n===Clinical
    significance===\n\nThe malleus may be palpated by surgeons during ear surgery.
    It may become fixed in place due to surgical complications, causing hearing loss.
    \n\nThis may be corrected with further surgery.\n\n\n===History===\n\nSeveral
    sources attribute the discovery of the malleus to the anatomist and philosopher
    Alessandro Achillini. \n\nThe first brief written description of the malleus
    was by Berengario da Carpi in his Commentaria super anatomia Mundini (1521).
    \n\nNiccolo Massa's Liber introductorius anatomiae described the malleus in slightly
    more detail and likened both it and the incus to little hammers terming them
    malleoli.\n\n\n===Other animals===\n\nThe malleus is unique to mammals, and evolved
    from a lower jaw bone in basal amniotes called the articular, which still forms
    part of the jaw joint in reptiles and birds.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malleus"

  descriptionText: "\n\nINCUS\n\n\nThe incus or anvil is a bone in the middle ear.
    \n\nThe anvil-shaped small bone is one of three ossicles in the middle ear. \n\nThe
    incus receives vibrations from the malleus, to which it is connected laterally,
    and transmits these to the stapes medially. \n\nThe incus is so-called because
    of its resemblance to an anvil (Latin: Incus).\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\n\nThe
    incus is the second of the ossicles, three bones in the middle ear which act
    to transmit sound. \n\nIt is shaped like an anvil, and has a long and short crus
    extending from the body, which articulates with the malleus.:\u200A862\u200A
    The short crus attaches to the posterior ligament of the incus. \n\nThe long
    crus articulates with the stirrup at the lenticular process.\nThe superior ligament
    of the incus attaches at the body of the incus to the roof of the tympanic cavity.\n\n\n==
    Function ==\n\n\nVibrations in the middle ear are received via the tympanic membrane.
    \n\nThe malleus, resting on the membrane, conveys vibrations to the incus. \n\nThis
    in turn conveys vibrations to the stapes.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\"Incus\" means
    \"anvil\" in Latin. \n\nSeveral sources attribute the discovery of the incus
    to the anatomist and philosopher Alessandro Achillini. \n\nThe first brief written
    description of the incus was by Berengario da Carpi in his Commentaria super
    anatomia Mundini (1521). \n\nAndreas Vesalius, in his De humani corporis fabrica,
    was the first to compare the second element of the ossicles to an anvil, thereby
    giving it the name incus. \n\nThe final part of the long limb was once described
    as a \"fourth ossicle\" by Pieter Paaw in 1615.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incus"

    is the upper fixed (not fixed in Neopterygii) bone of the jaw formed from the
    fusion of two maxillary bones. \n\nIn humans, the upper jaw includes the hard
    palate in the front of the mouth.\n\nThe two maxillary bones are fused at the
    intermaxillary suture, forming the anterior nasal spine. \n\nThis is similar
    to the mandible (lower jaw), which is also a fusion of two mandibular bones at
    the mandibular symphysis. \n\nThe mandible is the movable part of the jaw.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxilla"

  descriptionText: "\n\nCOSTAL CARTILAGE(S)\n\n\nThe costal cartilages are bars of
    hyaline cartilage that serve to prolong the ribs forward and contribute to the
    elasticity of the walls of the thorax. \n\nCostal cartilage is only found at
    the anterior ends of the ribs, providing medial extension.\n\n\n== Differences
    from Ribs 1-12 ==\n\nThe first seven pairs are connected with the sternum; the
    next three are each articulated with the lower border of the cartilage of the
    preceding rib; the last two have pointed extremities, which end in the wall of
    the abdomen.\n\nLike the ribs, the costal cartilages vary in their length, breadth,
    and direction. \n\nThey increase in length from the first to the seventh, then
    gradually decrease to the twelfth.\n\nTheir breadth, as well as that of the intervals
    between them, diminishes from the first to the last. \n\nThey are broad at their
    attachments to the ribs, and taper toward their sternal extremities, excepting
    the first two, which are of the same breadth throughout, and the sixth, seventh,
    and eighth, which are enlarged where their margins are in contact.\n\nThey also
    vary in direction: the first descends a little to the sternum, the second is
    horizontal, the third ascends slightly, while the others are angular, following
    the course of the ribs for a short distance, and then ascending to the sternum
    or preceding cartilage.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nEach costal cartilage presents
    two surfaces, two borders, and two extremities.\n\n\n=== Surfaces ===\n\nThe
    anterior surface is convex, and looks forward and upward: that of the first gives
    attachment to the costoclavicular ligament and the subclavius muscle; those of
    the first six or seven at their sternal ends, to the pectoralis major. \n\nThe
    others are covered by, and give partial attachment to, some of the flat muscles
    of the abdomen.\n\nThe posterior surface is concave, and directed backward and
    downward; that of the first gives attachment to the sternothyroideus, those of
    the third to the sixth inclusive to the transversus thoracis muscle, and the
    six or seven inferior ones to the transversus abdominis muscle and the diaphragm.\n\n\n===
    Borders ===\n\nOf the two borders the superior is concave, the inferior convex;
    they afford attachment to the intercostales interni: the upper border of the
    sixth gives attachment also to the pectoralis major.\n\nThe inferior borders
    of the sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth cartilages present heel-like projections
    at the points of greatest convexity. \n\nThese projections carry smooth oblong
    facets which articulate with facets on slight projections from the upper borders
    of the seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth cartilages, respectively.\n\n\n=== Interchondral
    articulations ===\n\nThe interchondral articulations are the joints formed between
    the costal cartilages of the ribs. \n\nThe contiguous borders of the sixth, seventh,
    and eighth, and sometimes those of the ninth and tenth, costal cartilages articulate
    with each other by small, smooth, oblong facets. \n\nEach articulation is enclosed
    in a thin articular capsule, lined by synovial membrane and strengthened laterally
    and medially by ligamentous fibers (interchondral ligaments) which pass from
    one cartilage to the other. \n\nSometimes the fifth costal cartilages, more rarely
    the ninth and tenth, articulate by their lower borders with the adjoining cartilages
    by small oval facets; more frequently the connection is by a few ligamentous
    fibers.\n\n\n=== Extremities ===\n\nThe lateral end of each cartilage is continuous
    with the osseous tissue of the rib to which it belongs.\n\nThe medial end of
    the first is continuous with the sternum; the medial ends of the six succeeding
    ones are rounded and are received into shallow concavities on the lateral margins
    of the sternum.\n\nThe medial ends of the eighth, ninth, and tenth costal cartilages
    are pointed, and are connected each with the cartilage immediately above.\n\nThose
    of the eleventh and twelfth are pointed and free.\n\n\n== Clinical significance
    ==\n\nIn old age, the costal cartilages are prone to superficial ossification.In
    costochondritis and Tietze syndrome, inflammation of the costal cartilage occurs.
    \n\nThis is a common cause of chest pain.Severe trauma may lead to fracture of
    the costal cartilage. \n\nSuch injuries often go unnoticed during x-ray scans,
    but can be diagnosed with CT scans. \n\nSurgery is typically used to fix the
    costal cartilage back onto either the rib or sternum.Costal cartilage may be
    harvested for reparative use elsewhere in the body. \n\nWhilst this is typically
    conducted using a general anaesthetic, IV sedation can also be used. \n\nThe
    procedure presents a minor risk of pleural tear.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costal_cartilage"

  descriptionText: "\n\nCALCANEUS\n\n\nIn humans and many other primates, the calcaneus
    (from the Latin calcaneus or calcaneum, meaning heel) or heel bone is a bone
    of the tarsus of the foot which constitutes the heel. \n\nIn some other animals,
    it is the point of the hock.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nIn humans, the calcaneus
    is the largest of the tarsal bones and the largest bone of the foot. \n\nThe
    talus bone, calcaneus, and navicular bone are considered the proximal row of
    tarsal bones. \n\nIn the calcaneus, several important structures can be distinguished:The
    half of the bone closest to the heel is the calcaneal tuberosity. \n\nOn its
    lower edge on either side are its lateral and medial processes (serving as the
    origins of the abductor hallucis and abductor digiti minimi). \n\nThe Achilles
    tendon is inserted into a roughened area on its superior side, the cuboid bone
    articulates with its anterior side, and on its superior side are three articular
    surfaces for the articulation with the talus bone. \n\nBetween these superior
    articulations and the equivalents on the talus is the tarsal sinus (a canal occupied
    by the interosseous talocalcaneal ligament). \n\nAt the upper and forepart of
    the medial surface of the calcaneus, below the middle talar facet, there is a
    horizontal eminence, the talar shelf (also sustentaculum tali), which gives attachment
    to the plantar calcaneonavicular (spring) ligament, tibiocalcaneal ligament,
    and medial talocalcaneal ligament. \n\nThis eminence is concave above, and articulates
    with the middle calcaneal articular surface of the talus; below, it is grooved
    for the tendon of the flexor hallucis longus; its anterior margin gives attachment
    to the plantar calcaneonavicular ligament, and its medial margin to a part of
    the deltoid ligament of the ankle-joint.\n\nOn the lateral side is commonly a
    tubercle called the calcaneal tubercle (or trochlear process). \n\nThis is a
    raised projection located between the tendons of the peroneus longus and brevis.
    \n\nIt separates the two oblique grooves of the lateral surface of the calcaneus
    (for the tendons of the peroneal muscles).\n\nIts chief anatomical significance
    is as a point of divergence of the previously common pathway shared by the distal
    tendons of peroneus longus and peroneus brevis en route to their distinct respective
    attachment sites.\n\nThe calcaneus is part of two joints: the proximal intertarsal
    joint and the talocalcaneal joint. \n\nThe point of the calcaneus is covered
    by the calcanean bursa.\n\n\n=== Development ===\n\nIn the calcaneus, an ossification
    center, is developed during the 4th\u20137th week of fetal development.\n\n\n==
    Function ==\n\nThree muscles insert on the calcaneus: the gastrocnemius, soleus,
    and plantaris. \n\nThese muscles are part of the posterior compartment of the
    leg and aid in walking, running and jumping. \n\nTheir specific functions include
    plantarflexion of the foot, flexion of the knee, and steadying the leg on the
    ankle during standing. \n\nThe calcaneus also serves as origin for several short
    muscles that run along the sole of the foot and control the toes.\n\n\n== Clinical
    significance ==\n\n\nNormally the tibia sits vertically above the calcaneus (pes
    rectus). \n\nIf the calcaneal axis between these two bones is turned medially
    the foot is in an everted position (pes valgus), and if it is turned laterally
    the foot is in an inverted position (pes varus).\n\nCalcaneal fracture, also
    known as Lover's fracture and Don Juan fracture\n\n\n== Disease ==\n\nThe talar
    shelf is typically involved in subtalar or talocalcaneal tarsal coalition.\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcaneus"

  descriptionText: "\n\nTIBIA\n\n\nThe tibia  (plural tibiae  or tibias), also known
    as the shinbone or shankbone, is the larger, stronger, and anterior (frontal)
    of the two bones in the leg below the knee in vertebrates (the other being the
    fibula, behind and to the outside of the tibia), and it connects the knee with
    the ankle bones. \n\nThe tibia is found on the medial side of the leg next to
    the fibula and closer to the median plane or centre-line. \n\nThe tibia is connected
    to the fibula by the interosseous membrane of leg, forming a type of fibrous
    joint called a syndesmosis with very little movement. \n\nThe tibia is named
    for the flute tibia. \n\nIt is the second largest bone in the human body next
    to the femur. \n\nThe leg bones are the strongest long bones as they support
    the rest of the body.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nIn human anatomy, the tibia is
    the second largest bone next to the femur. \n\nAs in other vertebrates the tibia
    is one of two bones in the lower leg, the other being the fibula, and is a component
    of the knee and ankle joints.\n\nThe ossification or formation of the bone starts
    from three centers; one in the shaft and one in each extremity.\n\nThe tibia
    is categorized as a long bone and is as such composed of a diaphysis and two
    epiphyses. \n\nThe diaphysis is the midsection of the tibia, also known as the
    shaft or body. \n\nWhile the epiphyses are the two rounded extremities of the
    bone; an upper (also known as superior or proximal) closest to the thigh and
    a lower (also known as inferior or distal) closest to the foot. \n\nThe tibia
    is most contracted in the lower third and the distal extremity is smaller than
    the proximal.\n\n\n=== Upper extremity ===\n\n==== Condyles of tibia ====\n\nThe
    proximal or upper extremity of the tibia is expanded in the transverse plane
    with a medial and lateral condyle, which are both flattened in the horizontal
    plane. \n\nThe medial condyle is the larger of the two and is better supported
    over the shaft. \n\nThe upper surfaces of the condyles articulate with the femur
    to form the tibiofemoral joint, the weightbearing part of the kneejoint.\n\nThe
    medial and lateral condyle are separated by the intercondylar area, where the
    cruciate ligaments and the menisci attach. \n\nHere the medial and lateral intercondylar
    tubercle forms the intercondylar eminence. \n\nTogether with the medial and lateral
    condyle the intercondylar region forms the tibial plateau, which both articulates
    with and is anchored to the lower extremity of the femur. \n\nThe intercondylar
    eminence divides the intercondylar area into an anterior and posterior part.
    \n\nThe anterolateral region of the anterior intercondylar area are perforated
    by numerous small openings for nutrient arteries.\n\nThe articular surfaces of
    both condyles are concave, particularly centrally. \n\nThe flatter outer margins
    are in contact with the menisci. \n\nThe medial condyles superior surface is
    oval in form and extends laterally onto the side of medial intercondylar tubercle.
    \n\nThe lateral condyles superior surface is more circular in form and its medial
    edge extends onto the side of the lateral intercondylar tubercle. \n\nThe posterior
    surface of the medial condyle bears a horizontal groove for part of the attachment
    of the semimembranosus muscle, whereas the lateral condyle has a circular facet
    for articulation with the head of the fibula.\n\nBeneath the condyles is the
    tibial tuberosity which serves for attachment of the patellar ligament, a continuation
    of the quadriceps femoris muscle.\n\n\n==== Facets ====\n\nThe superior articular
    surface presents two smooth articular facets.\n\nThe medial facet, oval in shape,
    is slightly concave from side to side, and from before backward.\n\nThe lateral,
    nearly circular, is concave from side to side, but slightly convex from before
    backward, especially at its posterior part, where it is prolonged on to the posterior
    surface for a short distance.\n\nThe central portions of these facets articulate
    with the condyles of the femur, while their peripheral portions support the menisci
    of the knee joint, which here intervene between the two bones.\n\n\n==== Intercondyloid
    eminence ====\n\nBetween the articular facets in the intercondylar area, but
    nearer the posterior than the anterior aspect of the bone, is the intercondyloid
    eminence (spine of tibia), surmounted on either side by a prominent tubercle,
    on to the sides of which the articular facets are prolonged; in front of and
    behind the intercondyloid eminence are rough depressions for the attachment of
    the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments and the menisci.\n\n\n==== Surfaces
    ====\n\nThe anterior surfaces of the condyles are continuous with one another,
    forming a large somewhat flattened area; this area is triangular, broad above,
    and perforated by large vascular foramina; narrow below where it ends in a large
    oblong elevation, the tuberosity of the tibia, which gives attachment to the
    patellar ligament; a bursa intervenes between the deep surface of the ligament
    and the part of the bone immediately above the tuberosity.\n\nPosteriorly, the
    condyles are separated from each other by a shallow depression, the posterior
    intercondyloid fossa, which gives attachment to part of the posterior cruciate
    ligament of the knee-joint. The medial condyle presents posteriorly a deep transverse
    groove, for the insertion of the tendon of the semimembranosus.\n\nIts medial
    surface is convex, rough, and prominent; it gives attachment to the medial collateral
    ligament.\nThe lateral condyle presents posteriorly a flat articular facet, nearly
    circular in form, directed downward, backward, and lateralward, for articulation
    with the head of the fibula. \n\nIts lateral surface is convex, rough, and prominent
    in front: on it is an eminence, situated on a level with the upper border of
    the tuberosity and at the junction of its anterior and lateral surfaces, for
    the attachment of the iliotibial band. \n\nJust below this a part of the extensor
    digitorum longus takes origin and a slip from the tendon of the biceps femoris
    is inserted.\n\n\n=== Shaft ===\n\nThe shaft or body of the tibia is triangular
    in cross-section and forms three borders: An anterior, medial and lateral or
    interosseous border. \n\nThese three borders form three surfaces; the medial,
    lateral and posterior.\n\nThe forward flat part of the tibia is called the fibia,
    often confused with the fibula.\n\n\n==== Borders ====\n\nThe anterior crest
    or border, the most prominent of the three, commences above at the tuberosity,
    and ends below at the anterior margin of the medial malleolus. \n\nIt is sinuous
    and prominent in the upper two-thirds of its extent, but smooth and rounded below;
    it gives attachment to the deep fascia of the leg.\n\nThe medial border is smooth
    and rounded above and below, but more prominent in the center; it begins at the
    back part of the medial condyle, and ends at the posterior border of the medial
    malleolus; its upper part gives attachment to the tibial collateral ligament
    of the knee-joint to the extent of about 5 cm., and insertion to some fibers
    of the popliteus muscle; from its middle third some fibers of the soleus and
    flexor digitorum longus muscles take origin.\n\nThe interosseous crest or lateral
    border is thin and prominent, especially its central part, and gives attachment
    to the interosseous membrane; it commences above in front of the fibular articular
    facet, and bifurcates below, to form the boundaries of a triangular rough surface,
    for the attachment of the interosseous ligament connecting the tibia and fibula.\n\n\n====
    Surfaces ====\n\nThe medial surface is smooth, convex, and broader above than
    below; its upper third, directed forward and medialward, is covered by the aponeurosis
    derived from the tendon of the sartorius, and by the tendons of the Gracilis
    and Semitendinosus, all of which are inserted nearly as far forward as the anterior
    crest; in the rest of its extent it is subcutaneous.\n\nThe lateral surface is
    narrower than the medial; its upper two-thirds present a shallow groove for the
    origin of the Tibialis anterior; its lower third is smooth, convex, curves gradually
    forward to the anterior aspect of the bone, and is covered by the tendons of
    the Tibialis anterior, Extensor hallucis longus, and Extensor digitorum longus,
    arranged in this order from the medial side.\n\nThe posterior surface presents,
    at its upper part, a prominent ridge, the popliteal line, which extends obliquely
    downward from the back part of the articular facet for the fibula to the medial
    border, at the junction of its upper and middle thirds; it marks the lower limit
    of the insertion of the Popliteus, serves for the attachment of the fascia covering
    this muscle, and gives origin to part of the Soleus, Flexor digitorum longus,
    and Tibialis posterior. \n\nThe triangular area, above this line, gives insertion
    to the Popliteus. \n\nThe middle third of the posterior surface is divided by
    a vertical ridge into two parts; the ridge begins at the popliteal line and is
    well-marked above, but indistinct below; the medial and broader portion gives
    origin to the Flexor digitorum longus, the lateral and narrower to part of the
    Tibialis posterior. \n\nThe remaining part of the posterior surface is smooth
    and covered by the Tibialis posterior, Flexor digitorum longus, and Flexor hallucis
    longus. Immediately below the popliteal line is the nutrient foramen, which is
    large and directed obliquely downward.\n\n\n=== Lower extremity ===\n\nThe distal
    end of the tibia is much smaller than the proximal end and presents five surfaces;
    it is prolonged downward on its medial side as a strong pyramidal process, the
    medial malleolus. \n\nThe lower extremity of the tibia together with the fibula
    and talus forms the ankle joint.\n\n\n==== Surfaces ====\n\nThe inferior articular
    surface is quadrilateral, and smooth for articulation with the talus. \n\nIt
    is concave from before backward, broader in front than behind, and traversed
    from before backward by a slight elevation, separating two depressions. \n\nIt
    is continuous with that on the medial malleolus.\n\nThe anterior surface of the
    lower extremity is smooth and rounded above, and covered by the tendons of the
    Extensor muscles; its lower margin presents a rough transverse depression for
    the attachment of the articular capsule of the ankle-joint.\n\nThe posterior
    surface is traversed by a shallow groove directed obliquely downward and medialward,
    continuous with a similar groove on the posterior surface of the talus and serving
    for the passage of the tendon of the Flexor hallucis longus.\n\nThe lateral surface
    presents a triangular rough depression for the attachment of the inferior interosseous
    ligament connecting it with the fibula; the lower part of this depression is
    smooth, covered with cartilage in the fresh state, and articulates with the fibula.
    \n\nThe surface is bounded by two prominent borders (the anterior and posterior
    colliculi), continuous above with the interosseous crest; they afford attachment
    to the anterior and posterior ligaments of the lateral malleolus.\n\nThe medial
    surface -- see medial malleolus for details.\n\n\n==== Fractures ====\n\nAnkle
    fractures of the tibia have several classification systems based on location
    or mechanism:\n\nMedial malleolus - Herscovici classification\nPosterior malleolus
    - Haruguchi classification\nMechanism - Lauge-Hansen classification\n\n\n===
    Blood supply ===\n\nThe tibia is supplied with blood from two sources: A nutrient
    artery, as the main source, and periosteal vessels derived from the anterior
    tibial artery.\n\n\n=== Joints ===\n\nThe tibia is a part of four joints; the
    knee, ankle, superior and inferior tibiofibular joint.\n\nIn the knee the tibia
    forms one of the two articulations with the femur, often referred to as the tibiofemoral
    components of the knee joint. \n\nThis is the weightbearing part of the knee
    joint.\n\nThe tibiofibular joints are the articulations between the tibia and
    fibula which allows very little movement.\n\nThe proximal tibiofibular joint
    is a small plane joint. \n\nThe joint is formed between the undersurface of the
    lateral tibial condyle and the head of fibula. \n\nThe joint capsule is reinforced
    by anterior and posterior ligament of the head of the fibula.\n\nThe distal tibiofibular
    joint (tibiofibular syndesmosis) is formed by the rough, convex surface of the
    medial side of the distal end of the fibula, and a rough concave surface on the
    lateral side of the tibia.\n\nThe part of the ankle joint known as the talocrural
    joint, is a synovial hinge joint that connects the distal ends of the tibia and
    fibula in the lower limb with the proximal end of the talus. \n\nThe articulation
    between the tibia and the talus bears more weight than between the smaller fibula
    and the talus.\n\n\n=== Development ===\n\nThe tibia is ossified from three centers;
    a primary center for the diaphysis (shaft) and a secondary center for each epiphysis
    (extremity). Ossification begins in the center of the body, about the seventh
    week of fetal life, and gradually extends toward the extremities.\n\nThe center
    for the upper epiphysis appears before or shortly after birth at close to 34
    weeks gestation; it is flattened in form, and has a thin tongue-shaped process
    in front, which forms the tuberosity; that for the lower epiphysis appears in
    the second year.\n\nThe lower epiphysis fuses with the tibial shaft at about
    the eighteenth, and the upper one fuses about the twentieth year.\n\nTwo additional
    centers occasionally exist, one for the tongue-shaped process of the upper epiphysis,
    which forms the tuberosity, and one for the medial malleolus.\n\n\n== Function
    ==\n\n=== Muscle attachments ===\n\n=== Strength ===\n\nThe tibia has been modeled
    as taking an axial force during walking that is up to 4.7 bodyweight. \n\nIts
    bending moment in the sagittal plane in the late stance phase is up to 71.6 bodyweight
    times millimetre.\n\n\n== Clinical significance ==\n\n=== Fracture ===\n\nFractures
    of the tibia can be divided into those that only involve the tibia; bumper fracture,
    Segond fracture, Gosselin fracture, toddler's fracture, and those including both
    the tibia and fibula; trimalleolar fracture, bimalleolar fracture, Pott's fracture.\n\n\n==
    Society and culture ==\n\nIn Judaism, the tibia, or shankbone, of a goat is used
    in the Passover Seder plate.\n\n\n== Other animals ==\n\nThe structure of the
    tibia in most other tetrapods is essentially similar to that in humans. \n\nThe
    tuberosity of the tibia, a crest to which the patellar ligament attaches in mammals,
    is instead the point for the tendon of the quadriceps muscle in reptiles, birds,
    and amphibians, which have no patella.\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibia"

  descriptionText: "\n\nZYGOMATIC BONE\n\n\nIn the human skull, the zygomatic bone
    (cheekbone or malar bone) is a paired irregular bone which articulates with the
    maxilla, the temporal bone, the sphenoid bone and the frontal bone. \n\nIt is
    situated at the upper and lateral part of the face and forms the prominence of
    the cheek, part of the lateral wall and floor of the orbit, and parts of the
    temporal fossa and the infratemporal fossa. \n\nIt presents a malar and a temporal
    surface; four processes (the frontosphenoidal, orbital, maxillary, and temporal),
    and four borders.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe term zygomatic derives from the
    Greek \u0396\u03C5\u03B3\u03CC\u03BC\u03B1 zygoma meaning \"yoke\". \n\nThe zygomatic
    bone is occasionally referred to as the zygoma, but this term may also refer
    to the zygomatic arch.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\n\n\n=== Surfaces ===\n\nThe malar
    surface is convex and perforated near its center by a small aperture, the zygomaticofacial
    foramen, for the passage of the zygomaticofacial nerve and vessels; below this
    foramen is a slight elevation, which gives origin to the zygomaticus muscle.\nThe
    temporal surface, directed posteriorly and medially, is concave, presenting medially
    a rough, triangular area, for articulation with the maxilla (articular surface),
    and laterally a smooth, concave surface, the upper part of which forms the anterior
    boundary of the temporal fossa, the lower a part of the infratemporal fossa.
    \n\nNear the center of this surface is the zygomaticotemporal foramen for the
    transmission of the zygomaticotemporal nerve.\nThe orbital surface forms the
    lateral part and some of the inferior part of the bony orbit. \n\nThe zygomatic
    nerve passes through the zygomatic-orbital foramen on this surface. \n\nThe lateral
    palpebral ligament attaches to a small protuberance called the orbital tubercle.\n\n\n===
    Processes ===\n\nEach zygomatic bone is diamond-shaped and composed of three
    processes with similarly named associated bony articulations: frontal, temporal,
    and maxillary. \n\nEach process of the zygomatic bone forms important structures
    of the skull.\nThe orbital surface of the frontal process of the zygomatic bone
    forms the anterior lateral orbital wall, with usually a small paired foramen,
    the zygomaticofacial foramen opening on its lateral surface. \n\nThe temporal
    process of the zygomatic bone forms the zygomatic arch along with the zygomatic
    process of the temporal bone, with a paired zygomaticotemporal foramen present
    on the medial deep surface of the bone. \n\nThe orbital surface of the maxillary
    process of the zygomatic bone forms a part of the infraorbital rim and a small
    part of the anterior part of the lateral orbital wall.\n\n\n=== Orbital process
    ===\n\nThe orbital process is a thick, strong plate, projecting backward and
    medialward from the orbital margin. \n\nIts antero-medial surface forms, by its
    junction with the orbital surface of the maxilla and with the great wing of the
    sphenoid, part of the floor and lateral wall of the orbit. \n\nOn it are seen
    the orifices of two canals, the zygomatico-orbital foramina; one of these canals
    opens into the temporal fossa, the other on the malar surface of the bone; the
    former transmits the zygomaticotemporal, the latter the zygomaticofacial nerve.\n\nIts
    postero-lateral surface, smooth and convex, forms parts of the temporal and infratemporal
    fossae.\nIts anterior margin, smooth and rounded, is part of the circumference
    of the orbit.\nIts superior margin, rough, and directed horizontally, articulates
    with the frontal bone behind the zygomatic process.\nIts posterior margin is
    serrated for articulation, with the great wing of the sphenoid and the orbital
    surface of the maxilla.At the angle of junction of the sphenoidal and maxillary
    portions, a short, concave, non-articular part is generally seen; this forms
    the anterior boundary of the inferior orbital fissure: occasionally, this non-articular
    part is absent, the fissure then being completed by the junction of the maxilla
    and sphenoid, or by the interposition of a small sutural bone in the angular
    interval between them.\n\n\n=== Borders ===\n\nThe antero-superior or orbital
    border is smooth, concave, and forms a considerable part of the circumference
    of the orbit.\nThe antero-inferior or maxillary border is rough, and bevelled
    at the expense of its inner table, to articulate with the maxilla; near the orbital
    margin it gives origin to the quadratus labii superioris.\nThe postero-superior
    or temporal border, curved like an italic letter f, is continuous above with
    the commencement of the temporal line, and below with the upper border of the
    zygomatic arch; the temporal fascia is attached to it.\nThe postero-inferior
    or zygomatic border affords attachment by its rough edge to the masseter.\n\n\n===
    Articulations ===\n\nThe zygomatic bone articulates with the frontal bone, sphenoid
    bone, and paired temporal bones, and maxillary bones.\n\n\n=== Development ===\n\nThe
    zygomatic bone is generally described as ossifying from three centers\u2014one
    for the malar and two for the orbital portion; these appear about the eighth
    week and fuse about the fifth month of fetal life.\nMall describes it as being
    ossified from one center which appears just beneath and to the lateral side of
    the orbit.\nAfter birth, the bone is sometimes divided by a horizontal suture
    into an upper larger, and a lower smaller division.\nIn some quadrumana the zygomatic
    bone consisted of two parts, an orbital and a malar.\n\n\n== Society and culture
    ==\n\n\nPronounced zygomatic arches, commonly called \"high cheekbones\", are
    considered a beauty trait in some cultures, in both males and females.Ancient
    Chinese sculptures of goddesses typically have a \"broad forehead, raised eyebrows,
    high cheekbones, and large, sensuous mouth\". \n\nSimilarly, many depictions
    of Qin warriors in the Terracotta Army are depicted with \"broad foreheads, high
    cheekbones, large eyes, thick eyebrows, and stiff beards.\"For this reason some
    individuals undergo cheek augmentation, a form of cosmetic surgery.\n\n\n== Other
    animals ==\n\nThe zygomatic is homologous to the jugal bone of other tetrapods.\n\n\n===
    Non-mammalian vertebrates ===\n\n\nIn non-mammalian vertebrates, the zygomatic
    bone is referred to as the jugal bone, since these animals have no zygomatic
    arch. \n\nIt is found in most reptiles, amphibians, and birds. \n\nIt is connected
    to the quadratojugal and maxilla, as well as other bones, which may vary by species.\nThis
    bone is considered key in the determination of general traits of the skull, as
    in the case of creatures, such as dinosaurs in paleontology, whose entire skull
    has not been found. \n\nIn coelacanths and early tetrapods the bone is relatively
    large. \n\nHere, it is a plate-like bone forming the lower margin of the orbit
    and much of the side of the face. \n\nIn ray-finned fishes it is reduced or absent,
    and the entire cheek region is generally small. \n\nThe bone is also absent in
    living amphibians.With the exception of turtles, the jugal bone in reptiles forms
    a relatively narrow bar separating the orbit from the inferior temporal fenestra,
    of which it may also form the lower boundary. \n\nThe bone is similarly reduced
    in birds. \n\nIn mammals, it takes on broadly the form seen in humans, with the
    bar between the orbit and fenestra vanishing entirely, and only the lower boundary
    of the fenestra remaining, as the zygomatic arch.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zygomatic_bone"

  descriptionText: "\n\nNAVICULAR BONE\n\n\nThe navicular bone is a small bone found
    in the feet of most mammals.\n\n\n== Human anatomy ==\n\nThe navicular bone in
    humans is one of the tarsal bones, found in the foot. \n\nIts name derives from
    the human bone's resemblance to a small boat, caused by the strongly concave
    proximal articular surface. \n\nThe term navicular bone or hand navicular bone
    was formerly used for the scaphoid bone, one of the carpal bones of the wrist.\n\nThe
    navicular bone in humans is located on the medial side of the foot, and articulates
    proximally with the talus, distally with the three cuneiform bones, and laterally
    with the cuboid.\n\nIt is the last of the foot bones to start ossification and
    does not tend to do so until the end of the third year in girls and the beginning
    of the fourth year in boys, although a large range of variation has been reported.\n\nThe
    tibialis posterior is the only muscle that attaches to the navicular bone. \n\nThe
    main portion of the muscle inserts into the tuberosity of the navicular bone.
    \n\nAn accessory navicular bone may be present in 2\u201314% of the general population.\n\n\n===
    Clinical significance ===\n\nThe human navicular is not a commonly broken bone
    but it breaks due two reasons. \n\nThe first mechanism is a stress fracture which
    happens commonly in athletes and the other mechanism is a high energy trauma.
    \n\nThe navicular bone is a keystone of the foot: it is part of the coxa pedis
    and articulates with the talus, first, second and third cuneiform, cuboid and
    calcaneus. \n\nIt plays an important role in the biomechanics of the foot helping
    in inversion, eversion and motion; it is a structural link between midfoot and
    forefoot and it is part of the longitudinal and transverse arch of the foot.\n\n\n==
    Horse anatomy ==\n\nThe horse has a sesamoid bone called the navicular bone,
    located within the hoof, that lies on the palmar aspect of the coffin joint between
    the second phalanx and third phalanx (coffin bone). \n\nThe navicular bone in
    the horse is supported by the distal sesamoidean impar ligament and two collateral
    sesamoidean ligaments. \n\nThe navicular bursa is located between the flexor
    surface of the navicular bone and the deep digital flexor tendon, which runs
    between the bursa and the distal phalanx. \n\nThe central tarsal bone in the
    hock of the horse is homologous and analogous to the navicular bone of the human
    foot, and thus the navicular bone in the horse is a different structure from
    the eponymously labeled bone in humans.\n\nThe navicular region is an important
    structure in relation to lameness, particularly in the front feet, and is involved
    with a significant disease process called navicular disease or navicular syndrome.
    \n\nRecently much of the original literature concerning navicular disease has
    been called into question, particularly the significance of radiographic changes
    as a sole diagnostic criterion. \n\nNavicular syndrome may be responsible for
    as much as 1/3 of all cases of lameness in horses, but radiographic changes in
    the navicular bone do not always provide a definitive diagnosis. \n\nNewer imaging
    techniques have shown that damage to the soft tissues in the region may be significant
    contributors to lameness and that multiple causes may result in visible lameness.\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navicular_bone"

    are a group of five long bones in the foot, located between the tarsal bones

    order: second, third, fourth, fifth and first.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe five
    metatarsals are dorsally convex long bones consisting of a shaft or body, a base
    (proximally), and a head (distally). \n\nThe body is prismoid in form, tapers
    gradually from the tarsal to the phalangeal extremity, and is curved longitudinally,
    so as to be concave below, slightly convex above. \n\nThe base or posterior extremity
    is wedge-shaped, articulating proximally with the tarsal bones, and by its sides
    with the contiguous metatarsal bones: its dorsal and plantar surfaces are rough
    for the attachment of ligaments. \n\nThe head or distal extremity presents a
    convex articular surface, oblong from above downward, and extending farther backward
    below than above. \n\nIts sides are flattened, and on each is a depression, surmounted
    by a tubercle, for ligamentous attachment. \n\nIts plantar surface is grooved
    antero-posteriorly for the passage of the flexor tendons, and marked on either
    side by an articular eminence continuous with the terminal articular surface.\n\nDuring
    growth, the growth plates are located distally on the metatarsals, except on
    the first metatarsal where it is located proximally. \n\nYet it is quite common
    to have an accessory growth plate on the distal first metatarsal.\n\n\n=== Articulations
    ===\n\n\nThe base of each metatarsal bone articulates with one or more of the
    tarsal bones at the tarsometatarsal joints, and the head with one of the first
    row of phalanges at the metatarsophalangeal joints. \n\nTheir bases also articulate
    with each other at the intermetatarsal joints\n\n-The first metatarsal articulates
    with the medial cuneiform, and to a small extent to the intermediate cuneiform.\n-the
    second with all three cuneiforms.\n-the third with the lateral cuneiform.\n-the
    fourth with the lateral cuneiform and the cuboid.\n-The fifth with the cuboid.\n\n\n==
    Clinical significance ==\n\n=== Injuries ===\n\nThe metatarsal bones are often
    broken by association football players. \n\nThese and other recent cases have
    been attributed to the lightweight design of modern football boots, which provide
    less protection to the foot. \n\nIn 2010 some soccer players began testing a
    new sock that incorporated a rubber silicone pad over the foot to provide protection
    to the top of the foot. \n\nStress fractures are thought to account for 16% of
    injuries related to sports participation, and the metatarsals are the bones most
    often involved. \n\nThese fractures are sometimes called march fractures, based
    on their traditional association with military recruits after long marches. \n\nThe
    second and third metatarsals are fixed while walking, thus these metatarsals
    are common sites of injury. \n\nThe fifth metatarsal may be fractured if the
    foot is oversupinated during locomotion.Protection from injuries can be given
    by the use of safety footwear which can use built-in or removable metatarsal
    guards.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metatarsal_bones"

  descriptionText: "\n\nSEVENTH RIB\n\n\n== Structure of the rib cage ==\n\nRibs
    are described based on their location and connection with the sternum. \n\nAll
    ribs are attached posteriorly to the thoracic vertebrae and are numbered accordingly
    one to twelve. \n\nRibs that articulate directly with the sternum are called
    true ribs, whereas those that do not articulate directly are termed false ribs.
    \n\n\n=== Attachment of the rib cage ===\n\nThe terms true ribs and false ribs
    describe rib pairs that are directly or indirectly attached to the sternum. \n\nThe
    first seven rib pairs known as the fixed or vertebrosternal ribs are the true
    ribs (Latin: costae verae) as they connect directly to the sternum; the next
    five pairs (eighth to twelfth) are the false ribs (Latin: costae spuriae). \n\n\n===
    Parts of rib (general) ===\n\nEach rib consists of a head, neck, and a shaft.
    \n\nAll ribs are attached posteriorly to the thoracic vertebrae. \n\nThey are
    numbered to match the vertebrae they attach to \u2013 one to twelve, from top
    (T1) to bottom. \n\nThe head of the rib is the end part closest to the vertebra
    with which it articulates. \n\nIt is marked by a kidney-shaped articular surface
    which is divided by a horizontal crest into two articulating regions. \n\nThe
    upper region articulates with the inferior costal facet on the vertebra above,
    and the larger region articulates with the superior costal facet on the vertebra
    with the same number. \n\nThe transverse process of a thoracic vertebra also
    articulates at the transverse costal facet with the tubercle of the rib of the
    same number. \n\nThe crest gives attachment to the intra-articular ligament.The
    neck of the rib is the flattened part that extends laterally from the head. \n\nThe
    neck is about 3 cm long. \n\nIts anterior surface is flat and smooth, whilst
    its posterior is perforated by numerous foramina and its surface rough, to give
    attachment to the ligament of the neck. \n\nIts upper border presents a rough
    crest (crista colli costae) for the attachment of the anterior costotransverse
    ligament; its lower border is rounded.\n\nOn the posterior surface at the neck,
    is an eminence\u2014the tubercle that consists of an articular and a non-articular
    portion. \n\nThe articular portion is the lower and more medial of the two and
    presents a small, oval surface for articulation with the transverse costal facet
    on the end of the transverse process of the lower of the two vertebrae to which
    the head is connected. \n\nThe non-articular portion is a rough elevation and
    affords attachment to the ligament of the tubercle. \n\nThe tubercle is much
    more prominent in the upper ribs than in the lower ribs.\n\nThe angle of a rib
    (costal angle) may both refer to the bending part of it, and a prominent line
    in this area, a little in front of the tubercle. \n\nThis line is directed downward
    and laterally; this gives attachment to a tendon of the iliocostalis muscle.
    \n\nAt this point, the rib is bent in two directions, and at the same time twisted
    on its long axis.\n\nThe distance between the angle and the tubercle is progressively
    greater from the second to the tenth ribs. \n\nThe area between the angle and
    the tubercle is rounded, rough, and irregular, and serves for the attachment
    of the longissimus dorsi muscle.\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rib_cage"

  descriptionText: "\n\nTHIRD RIB\n\n\n== Structure of the rib cage ==\n\nRibs are
    described based on their location and connection with the sternum. \n\nAll ribs
    are attached posteriorly to the thoracic vertebrae and are numbered accordingly
    one to twelve. \n\nRibs that articulate directly with the sternum are called
    true ribs, whereas those that do not articulate directly are termed false ribs.
    \n\n\n=== Attachment of the rib cage ===\n\nThe terms true ribs and false ribs
    describe rib pairs that are directly or indirectly attached to the sternum. \n\nThe
    first seven rib pairs known as the fixed or vertebrosternal ribs are the true
    ribs (Latin: costae verae) as they connect directly to the sternum; the next
    five pairs (eighth to twelfth) are the false ribs (Latin: costae spuriae). \n\n\n===
    Parts of rib (general) ===\n\nEach rib consists of a head, neck, and a shaft.
    \n\nAll ribs are attached posteriorly to the thoracic vertebrae. \n\nThey are
    numbered to match the vertebrae they attach to \u2013 one to twelve, from top
    (T1) to bottom. \n\nThe head of the rib is the end part closest to the vertebra
    with which it articulates. \n\nIt is marked by a kidney-shaped articular surface
    which is divided by a horizontal crest into two articulating regions. \n\nThe
    upper region articulates with the inferior costal facet on the vertebra above,
    and the larger region articulates with the superior costal facet on the vertebra
    with the same number. \n\nThe transverse process of a thoracic vertebra also
    articulates at the transverse costal facet with the tubercle of the rib of the
    same number. \n\nThe crest gives attachment to the intra-articular ligament.The
    neck of the rib is the flattened part that extends laterally from the head. \n\nThe
    neck is about 3 cm long. \n\nIts anterior surface is flat and smooth, whilst
    its posterior is perforated by numerous foramina and its surface rough, to give
    attachment to the ligament of the neck. \n\nIts upper border presents a rough
    crest (crista colli costae) for the attachment of the anterior costotransverse
    ligament; its lower border is rounded.\n\nOn the posterior surface at the neck,
    is an eminence\u2014the tubercle that consists of an articular and a non-articular
    portion. \n\nThe articular portion is the lower and more medial of the two and
    presents a small, oval surface for articulation with the transverse costal facet
    on the end of the transverse process of the lower of the two vertebrae to which
    the head is connected. \n\nThe non-articular portion is a rough elevation and
    affords attachment to the ligament of the tubercle. \n\nThe tubercle is much
    more prominent in the upper ribs than in the lower ribs.\n\nThe angle of a rib
    (costal angle) may both refer to the bending part of it, and a prominent line
    in this area, a little in front of the tubercle. \n\nThis line is directed downward
    and laterally; this gives attachment to a tendon of the iliocostalis muscle.
    \n\nAt this point, the rib is bent in two directions, and at the same time twisted
    on its long axis.\n\nThe distance between the angle and the tubercle is progressively
    greater from the second to the tenth ribs. \n\nThe area between the angle and
    the tubercle is rounded, rough, and irregular, and serves for the attachment
    of the longissimus dorsi muscle.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rib_cage"

  descriptionText: "\n\nMETACARPAL BONES\n\n\nIn human anatomy, the metacarpal bones
    or metacarpus, form the intermediate part of the skeletal hand located between
    the phalanges of the fingers and the carpal bones of the wrist which forms the
    connection to the forearm. \n\nThe metacarpal bones are analogous to the metatarsal
    bones in the foot.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\n\nThe metacarpals form a transverse
    arch to which the rigid row of distal carpal bones are fixed. \n\nThe peripheral
    metacarpals (those of the thumb and little finger) form the sides of the cup
    of the palmar gutter and as they are brought together they deepen this concavity.
    \n\nThe index metacarpal is the most firmly fixed, while the thumb metacarpal
    articulates with the trapezium and acts independently from the others. \n\nThe
    middle metacarpals are tightly united to the carpus by intrinsic interlocking
    bone elements at their bases. \n\nThe ring metacarpal is somewhat more mobile
    while the fifth metacarpal is semi-independent.Each metacarpal bone consists
    of a body or shaft, and two extremities: the head at the distal or digital end
    (near the fingers), and the base at the proximal or carpal end (close to the
    wrist).\n\n\n=== Body ===\n\nThe body (shaft) is prismoid in form, and curved,
    so as to be convex in the longitudinal direction behind, concave in front. \n\nIt
    presents three surfaces: medial, lateral, and dorsal.\n\nThe medial and lateral
    surfaces are concave, for the attachment of the interosseus muscles, and separated
    from one another by a prominent anterior ridge.\n\nThe dorsal surface presents
    in its distal two-thirds a smooth, triangular, flattened area which is covered
    in by the tendons of the extensor muscles. \n\nThis surface is bounded by two
    lines, which commence in small tubercles situated on either side of the digital
    extremity, and, passing upward, converge and meet some distance above the center
    of the bone and form a ridge which runs along the rest of the dorsal surface
    to the carpal extremity. \n\nThis ridge separates two sloping surfaces for the
    attachment of the interossei dorsales.\n\nTo the tubercles on the digital extremities
    are attached the collateral ligaments of the metacarpophalangeal joints.\n\n\n===
    Base ===\n\nThe base (basis) or carpal extremity is of a cuboidal form, and broader
    behind than in front: it articulates with the carpal bones and with the adjoining
    metacarpal bones; its dorsal and volar surfaces are rough, for the attachment
    of ligaments.\n\n\n=== Head ===\n\nThe head (caput) or digital extremity presents
    an oblong surface markedly convex from before backward, less so transversely,
    and flattened from side to side; it articulates with the proximal phalanx. \n\nIt
    is broader, and extends farther upward, on the volar than on the dorsal aspect,
    and is longer in the antero-posterior than in the transverse diameter. \n\nOn
    either side of the head is a tubercle for the attachment of the collateral ligament
    of the metacarpophalangeal joint.\n\nThe dorsal surface, broad and flat, supports
    the tendons of the extensor muscles.\n\nThe volar surface is grooved in the middle
    line for the passage of the flexor tendons, and marked on either side by an articular
    eminence continuous with the terminal articular surface.\n\n\n=== Neck ===\n\nThe
    neck, or subcapital segment, is the transition zone between the body and the
    head.\n\n\n=== Articulations ===\n\nBesides the metacarpophalangeal joints, the
    metacarpal bones articulate by carpometacarpal joints as follows:\n\n-the first
    with the trapezium;\n-the second with the trapezium, trapezoid, capitate and
    third metacarpal;\n-the third with the capitate and second and fourth metacarpals;\n-the
    fourth with the capitate, hamate, and third and fifth metacarpals;\n-and the
    fifth with the hamate and fourth metacarpal;\n        \n\n\n=== Insertions ===\n\n-Extensor
    Carpi Radialis Longus/Brevis: Both insert on the base of metacarpal II; Assist
    with wrist extension and radial flexion of the wrist\n-Extensor Carpi Ulnaris:
    Inserts on the base of metacarpal V; Extends and fixes wrist when digits are
    being flexed; assists with ulnar flexion of wrist\n-Abductor Pollicis Longus:
    Inserts on the trapezium and base of metacarpal I; Abducts thumb in frontal plane;
    extends thumb at carpometacarpal joint\n-Opponens Pollicis: Inserts on metacarpal
    I; flexes metacarpal I to oppose the thumb to the fingertips\n-Opponens digiti
    minimi: Inserts on the medial surface of metacarpal V; Flexes metacarpal V at
    carpometacarpal joint when little finger is moved into opposition with tip of
    thumb; deepens palm of hand.\n\n        \n\n\n== Clinical significance ==\n\n===
    Congenital disorders ===\n\nThe fourth and fifth metacarpal bones are commonly
    \"blunted\" or shortened, in pseudohypoparathyroidism and pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism.\n\nA
    blunted fourth metacarpal, with normal fifth metacarpal, can signify Turner syndrome.\n\nBlunted
    metacarpals (particularly the fourth metacarpal) are a symptom of Nevoid basal
    cell carcinoma syndrome.\n\n\n=== Fracture ===\n\nThe neck of a metacarpal is
    a common location for a boxer's fracture. \n\nHowever, all parts of the metacarpal
    bone (including head, body and base) are susceptible to fracture. \n\nFor these
    fractures several types of treatment exist ranging from non-operative techniques
    with or without immobilization to operative techniques using closed or open reduction
    and internal fixation (ORIF). \n\nGenerally speaking most fractures showing little
    or no displacement can be treated successfully without surgery. \n\nIntraarticular
    fracture-dislocations of the metacarpal head or base may require surgical fixation,
    as fragment displacement affecting the joint surface is rarely tolerated well.\n\n\n==
    Other animals ==\n\nIn four-legged animals, the metacarpals form part of the
    forefeet, and are frequently reduced in number, appropriate to the number of
    toes. \n\nIn digitigrade and unguligrade animals, the metacarpals are greatly
    extended and strengthened, forming an additional segment to the limb, a feature
    that typically enhances the animal's speed. \n\nIn both birds and bats, the metacarpals
    form part of the wing.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Etymology ===\n\nThe Greek physician
    Galen used to refer to the metacarpus as \u03BC\u03B5\u03C4\u03B1\u03BA\u03AC\u03C1\u03C0\u03B9\u03BF\u03BD.
    \n\nThe Latin form metacarpium more truly resembles its Ancient Greek predecessor
    \u03BC\u03B5\u03C4\u03B1\u03BA\u03AC\u03C1\u03C0\u03B9\u03BF\u03BD than metacarpus.
    \n\nMeta\u2013 is Greek for beyond and carpal from Ancient Greek \u03BA\u03B1\u03C1\u03C0\u03CC\u03C2
    (karp\xF3s, \u201Cwrist\u201D).\n\nIn anatomic Latin, adjectives like metacarpius,
    metacarpicus, metacarpiaeus, metacarpeus, metacarpianus and metacarpalis can
    be found. \n\nThe form metacarpius is more true to the later Greek form \u03BC\u03B5\u03C4\u03B1\u03BA\u03AC\u03C1\u03C0\u03B9\u03BF\u03C2.
    \n\nMetacarpalis, as in ossa metacarpalia in the current official Latin nomenclature,
    Terminologia Anatomica is a compound consisting of Latin and Greek parts. \n\nThe
    usage of such hybrids in anatomic Latin is disapproved by some.\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacarpal_bones"
